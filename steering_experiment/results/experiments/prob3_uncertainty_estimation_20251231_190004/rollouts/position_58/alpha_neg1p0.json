    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but let me check: 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's like a geometric series or something. Let me see. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's see if we can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a base-3 number or something. But I think the recursive approach and the formula I derived are solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach and deriving a closed-form formula, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. The final computation confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, reading from top, it's 88572. Wait, let me verify that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Now, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let's go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 first: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the closed-form formula also gives us 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nYes, because (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 can be rewritten as (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, without another layer. So, perhaps there are 9 layers? Let me see. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each set is of the form (1 + 3(...)), except the innermost one, which is just (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis is part of a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. After the first 3: (...\n2. Then another (...\n3. Then another (...\n4. Then another (...\n5. Then another (...\n6. Then another (...\n7. Then another (...\n8. Then another (...\n9. Then another (...\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. But each of those is part of a nested layer, so that would mean 9 layers. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, 9 layers in total, leading up to Layer 9 being 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a calculation error in any of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. Each layer's value is used correctly in the next layer, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the result.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next, 2*3=6 +1=7, tens digit is 7. Next, 5*3=15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1. Next, 9*3=27 +1=28, so thousands digit is 8, carryover 2. Next, 2*3=6 +2=8, ten-thousands digit is 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive formula. So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution can be found using the method for such recursions. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = (a^n)*C + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, actually, the standard form is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, which is what we have here. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, since b is a constant. So, let's find the particular solution. Assume Ln^p = K, a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but our layers are integers, so maybe this approach is correct but the constants will adjust. Then, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is L1=4, and the outermost layer is L9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But since each layer is similar, maybe E can be expressed in terms of itself. Wait, but in this case, E is 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the inner expression with eight layers. But since each layer is similar, E' would be similar to E but one layer less. However, this might not be straightforward because each time we're adding a new layer, the multiplier is 3 each time, so maybe it's a geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 3 + 9*3 + ... Wait, perhaps if I expand each layer, I can see a pattern. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, but in a more expanded form. Let me write E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is of the form (3^{n} - 1)/2, as we saw earlier, so the outermost expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer as before. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88572. To recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost layer of 1 + 3. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of a geometric-like sequence, we can compute the value efficiently. Alternatively, expanding each layer step by step also leads to the same result. Both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

But wait, let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps.

Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, manually computing each seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to recall a formula. But just for practice, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here. Let's consider the expression inside out. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But earlier, when I did 29,000 * 3 = 87,000 and 524 * 3 = 1,572, adding them gives 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. So, units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572? Wait, no, that's 88,572. But when I do it digit by digit, I get 88,752? Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in my digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   *       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8. But when written left to right, it's 88,572. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, when you write the digits, the first digit you write is the units place, then tens, etc. So the result should be 88,572. Let me confirm with another method. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the correct result is 88,572. So, going back, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is the same. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, we have:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition: For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe also need another condition. Let's compute L_2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nThen, substituting A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used a recursive formula to find a closed-form solution, and confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if there's a recurrence relation here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute a_{n} = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer step by step. This method is faster, especially if the number of layers is large, but since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Let me just do a quick sanity check. Each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, so each layer is growing exponentially. Since we have 9 layers, the number should be quite large, and 88,572 seems reasonable. If I had only 2 layers, for example, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. So, with each additional layer, the number grows by a factor of about 3. So, with 9 layers, 3^9 is 19683, but since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, the actual growth is a bit more than 3^n. So, 88,572 is a plausible number. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9, which gives 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 sections. I think there are 9 layers of 1+3, so Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this using another method or recognize a pattern. Wait, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, the recursive formula is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1, it's a bit different. But since I've already got the answer through two methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014I can be confident that the result is correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, recognizing a recursive pattern. Using a recurrence relation, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, this is consistent with what I did before. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, solved the recurrence relation, and confirmed the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final computation yields:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me consider that. If I have a nested expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Suppose I have a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches Layer 1. a_3 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. a_4 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which matches Layer 3. So, indeed, each layer is a term in this recursive sequence. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 1: 1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 1 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 => C = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (1/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. So, for each layer, the value is (3^n - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Wait, but in our problem, Layer 1 is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, Layer 2 would be a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, in general, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, n = 9, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer corresponds to a term in this sequence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. The problem is to compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^{n} + (d/(c - 1)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we need a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric progression. Let me try expanding the expression a bit to see if that's the case. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's denote the innermost expression as x, so x = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But I think the approach I took earlier with the recurrence relation is more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer is adding 1 and scaling by 3, so the entire expression is like a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a sum. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can expand this recursively: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for n=1: a_1 = 4, and 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 13, and 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = 40, and 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct. So, indeed, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the closed-form formula I derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern at first, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, and realized it's a geometric progression. Either way, whether by step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So the final step is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that's another way to confirm. So yes, 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, I can use another method to compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. The particular solution for a constant nonhomogeneous term can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. But in this case, since there are nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. But if there were, say, 20 layers, it would be much more efficient to use the formula. Anyway, I think I've got the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer by layer, I computed up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives me 88572. I also verified this using the formula for the linear recurrence, which gave the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, the ninth layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, that's neat! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula. Let me test it with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, arriving at the same result. That's reassuring. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation with the closed-form formula, or compute it directly using exponents, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the different methods all converge to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

So the result is 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*something. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That was a bit more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. Let me just recap the steps I took: 1. Recognized the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Decided to compute each layer starting from the innermost one. 3. Computed each layer step by step, ensuring no arithmetic errors. 4. After computing up to Layer 9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result. 5. Then, to verify, I considered the problem as a recurrence relation, found a general formula, and applied it to compute Layer 9, which matched my earlier result. 6. Finally, multiplied by 3 to get the answer. This thorough approach helps in avoiding mistakes and ensures that the solution is correct. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result.

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me check Layer 1 to Layer 9 again to ensure I didn't make any errors there. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n = 0, if we consider a_0, but since our layers start at n=1, maybe it's better to express the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved time, but since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This resembles a geometric series, but it's finite, with 9 layers. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recursive formula can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k - 1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k - 1). Wait, let me check that formula.\n\nAlternatively, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, k = 3, c = 1, and the initial term a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n - 1} * a_1 + c*(k^{n - 1} - 1)/(k - 1). So, in this case, a_1 = 4, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, for a_9, n = 9, so:\n\na_9 = 3^{8} * 4 + 1*(3^{8} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nWait, because n = 9, so a_9 = 3^{9 - 1} * 4 + 1*(3^{9 - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^8 * 4 + (3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nThen, a_9 = 6561 * 4 + (6561 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n6561 * 4 = 26244\n\n(6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280\n\nSo, a_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula is a quicker way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula is correctly applied. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term before the first application of the recurrence.\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which is after the first application. So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted. Let me think.\n\nWait, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. So, if I consider a_0 as the term before the first a_1, then a_1 = k*a_0 + c.\n\nIn our problem, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 is 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, the formula would be a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 = 1, k = 3, c = 1, and n = 9, since we have 9 layers after a_0.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nFor n = 1, a_1 = 3^1 * 1 + 1*(3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2, a_2 = 3^2 *1 + 1*(3^2 - 1)/2 = 9 + (9 - 1)/2 = 9 + 4 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 9, a_9 = 3^9 * 1 + 1*(3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683. So, a_9 = 19683 + (19683 - 1)/2 = 19683 + 19682/2 = 19683 + 9841 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers step by step, I thought of the innermost layer as Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9: 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and use it in the next. Applying this method, we determine the final result to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are 9 such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYep, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87,  then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit:5 * 3 = 15, so 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28, so 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom, we get 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87,572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3: 29524 *3: 29,524 *3.\n\nLet me compute it another way: 30,000 *3=90,000. But 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Wait, but that's different from 87,572. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, 29,524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000 \u2192 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n500 *3=1,500 \u2192 87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88,500 +60=88,560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, so the correct result is 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\nx    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing from right to left, the digits are 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, but when I write it down, the digits are 2 (units), then 7 (tens), then 5 (hundreds), then 8 (thousands), then 8 (ten thousands). So, the number is 88,572. That matches the correct result. So, I think I confused myself earlier when I thought it was 87,572, but it's actually 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation of each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9 \u2192 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240 \u2192 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as computed earlier.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the very end. So, yes, the final step is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It looks like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the initial term a_1 is 4, but the recurrence starts from a_1. Let me adjust the indices to match the formula.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. In our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the solution is a_n = (c/(r - 1)) + (a_0)*(r^{n}). Wait, let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe solution to a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given, is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, r = 3, c = 1, and a_0 = a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the first term after the initial condition. Maybe I should index it differently. Let me see: Let me consider a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is the innermost layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_8, since we have nine layers in total.\n\nWait, so the problem has nine layers, so n goes from 0 to 8, with a_8 being the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, using the formula, the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 4, is a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). So, a_n = 4*3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (8*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that:\n\nStarting with a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1).\n\nGiven a_0 = 4, so a_n = 4*3^n + (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nCombine terms: (8*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, for n = 8, a_8 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear recurrence, and then applied the formula directly. That might have saved some time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a safer approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nIn any case, after verifying each step and cross-checking with the formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value before the outermost multiplication by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\), starting from the innermost term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: As computed earlier, that's 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that can be generalized instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). If I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But since there are multiple layers, it's a bit more involved. However, since we've already found a closed-form formula, maybe that's the more efficient way. But in any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here to avoid computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to see if I added correctly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. This method is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But for just 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, though it's easy to make a calculation error. Using the formula is more efficient and reduces the chance of error. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. But with the carryover: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1. Next, 2*3=6 +1=7. Next, 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next, 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next, 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's do it another way: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All the layers seem to compute correctly. So, I think I did this right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote the layers as a sequence a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 directly without computing each a_i step by step. Let's see. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is given by a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the general solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, we can find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let me check: For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It's good to know that both methods give the same answer, so I can be confident that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3 times (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote S as the entire expression inside the first 3, then S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But in this case, since each layer is the same structure, S' is similar to S but one layer deeper. Wait, actually, each layer is a separate term, so maybe the entire expression is a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express it as such. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So, the entire expression inside the first 3 is a_9, which we've already computed as 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, the general formula for such a nested expression where each term is 1 + r*(next term) can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see: If I have S = 1 + r*(1 + r*(1 + r*(... ))), then S = 1 + r*S, which leads to S = 1/(1 - r), provided |r| < 1. But in our case, r=3, which is greater than 1, so the series doesn't converge, but in our problem, it's a finite series with 9 terms. So, perhaps we can model it as a finite geometric series. Let me think. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a finite expansion with 9 layers. So, perhaps we can model it as a sum: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))) with 9 layers. Let me try to express S in terms of itself. Wait, actually, S is the entire expression inside the first 3, so S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But S' is similar to S but with one fewer layer. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as a recurrence relation, which we did earlier, leading to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term which is 3^k, where k increases by 1 each time. Let me see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nSo, each layer n adds 3^n. Therefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. Wait, because Layer 1 is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k? Wait, no, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a finite geometric series, I arrive at the same result.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computations. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Wait a minute, these numbers seem similar to the terms in the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2 or something like that. Let me check. For example, L1=4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. L2=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. L3=40, which is (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Yes, that's a pattern! So, each Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 1: (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. And so on. So, in general, Layer k is (3^(k+1) -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Alternatively, I can consider that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, recursively, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the pattern I noticed earlier. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 is the same as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the layers because the original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(... Then, after the ninth layer, it's closed properly. So, yes, there are nine layers. So, when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I correctly did nine layers, and then multiplied the ninth layer by 3. So, my calculation seems correct, leading to 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or look for a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first layer (Layer 1) is a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so expanding it all the way would give a sum of a geometric series. But since it's nested, the closed-form approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I included the outermost 3 as part of Layer 9. Let me check the structure again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, that means nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute it again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. Let me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the overall expression is 3*a_9. So, I can compute a_9 using the recurrence and then multiply by 3. Let me compute a_1 to a_9 using this recurrence: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the result is 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9, as I did before. But perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (c*r^{n} - c)/(r - 1) + (a_0 - c/(r - 1))r^{n}. Wait, maybe I should look for a closed-form solution. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, after 9 layers, we have a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, I think I've thoroughly checked this and can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, given the repetitive structure.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of 1 + 3*(...), repeated multiple times. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I get the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 in another way.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and the computations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. To verify, I can add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm that 3*9841 is indeed 29523, and then adding 1 gives 29524. Yes, because 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, it's 88572. So, putting it all together, the expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) \u2192 Layer 9\n10. Finally, 3*(Layer 9) \u2192 Final result.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems right. Let me just verify each layer's computation step by step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps recognizing this as a geometric series? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's solve it properly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let's test it for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our case, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
