Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could add 29524 three times: 29524 +29524=59048, then +29524=88572. Either way, same result.

So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the value of the innermost is a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula, I could have directly computed it without going through each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable, both methods work. It's good to cross-verify using different approaches to ensure the answer is correct. So, yeah, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Using a recurrence relation approach, we find a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the problem is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. Similarly, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations.

    "text": " So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is always true. For constants: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, but since each term is nested, it's more of a geometric sequence. Either way, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 1 + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is 3*(a_9), and since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same answer. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.
