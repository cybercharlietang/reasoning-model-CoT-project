So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers.

Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, we also have the initial condition a_1 = 4.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, to recap, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found a closed-form expression that allowed me to compute the 9th layer directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which would have been time-consuming but manageable. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same result, which is reassuring. It's always good to check using different methods to ensure that the answer is consistent.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.

Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating terms: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Therefore, D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). There are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D So, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract D from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2D => 2D = -1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.
