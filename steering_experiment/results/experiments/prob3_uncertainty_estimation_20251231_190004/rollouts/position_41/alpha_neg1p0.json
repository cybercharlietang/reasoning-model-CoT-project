Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe we can compute each term as we did before. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a_n can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: a_n - r*a_{n-1} = c.\n\nThe characteristic equation would be k = r, so the homogeneous solution is A*r^n. For a particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = c + r*B\n\nSo, B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r)\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r)\n\nIn our case, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nSo, a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, we have 9 layers, so n goes from 1 to 9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was a_1 = 4, which according to this formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both the iterative step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, yes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Now, multiplying 29524 by 3: Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer once more using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: L4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: L5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: L6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: L7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: L8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent again. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But that seems similar to the recursive approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of itself, but I'm not sure if that would be helpful here. Let me try: Let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Then, the inner part is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(inner expression). So, S = 3*(1 + (S/3)) Wait, is that correct? Let me see: If the inner expression is the same as the entire expression divided by 3, then S = 3*(1 + S/3). Let's solve for S: S = 3*(1 + S/3) => S = 3 + S => S - S = 3 => 0 = 3. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps that approach isn't correct. Maybe I misrepresented the recursion. Alternatively, perhaps each layer is a separate recursion, so it's better to stick with the earlier method of computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula. I think that's more reliable. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, actually, L(1) is 1 + 3, which is 4, as I computed earlier. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88,572 as the answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that my solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression isn't too long, step-by-step computation is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined by the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. The solution to this recurrence is L(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me verify that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but L(1) is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me try solving the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think this method is more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, both methods work. I feel confident now that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a geometric progression.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that might represent this expression. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my earlier computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form formula from the start. Since there are nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, because doing it manually up to nine layers is time-consuming and error-prone. Hmm, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, perhaps I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which would make computing a_9 easier. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence relation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting with the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. Solving it gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Yep, that seems correct.

So, both methods give the same result.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a more efficient way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually? Maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see.\n\nLooking at each layer, it seems like each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, it seems to work. So, using this formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, expanding each layer step by step seems manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step as I did before is straightforward. However, just for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found by iteration. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio, but here we have an additional constant term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be written as a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nAssume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1\n\n= A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, using this formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we're dealing with a_9, which is the innermost layer, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something? Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has solution C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26 /2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80 /2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing this to L_n = A*3^n + B, we get: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well to verify. Since each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, and L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, so after 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers. Let me expand it step by step: Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost as E1: E1 =1 +3 =4\n\nThen E2 =1 +3*E1 =1 +3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +39=40\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +120=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, each term can be written as:\n\nE_n =1 +3*E_{n-1}\n\nWhich is the same recurrence as before.\n\nBut maybe if I expand the entire expression, I can see a pattern.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression without substituting each layer.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1's and 3's. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try expanding step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE9 =1 +3\n\nE8=1 +3*E9=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13\n\nE7=1 +3*E8=1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nE6=1 +3*E7=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E6=1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nE4=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nE3=1 +3*E4=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nE2=1 +3*E3=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nE1=1 +3*E2=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*E1=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each layer contributes a term of 3^k.\n\nWait, since each layer is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is E9=1 +3.\n\nThen E8=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13\n\nWhich is 1 +3 +3^2=13\n\nSimilarly, E7=1 +3*E8=1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nBut 3*13=39, which is 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 ?\n\nWait, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, sum is 27+9+3=39. So E7=1 +39=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nSimilarly, E6=1 +3*E7=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nBut 3*40=120=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1=81+27+9+3=120. So E6=1 +120=121=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each E_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nE9=1 +3=4=1 +3=4\n\nE8=1 +3 +9=13\n\nE7=1 +3 +9 +27=40\n\nE6=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121\n\nE5=1 +3 +9 +27 +81 +243=364\n\nWait, 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121, +243=364, yes.\n\nSo, each E_n is the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^n.\n\nWait, but in our case, E9 corresponds to n=1 (since E9=1+3). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, E9 is the innermost, which is 1 +3=4=3^0 +3^1=1 +3=4.\n\nThen E8=1 +3*E9=1 +3*(4)=13=3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nSimilarly, E7=1 +3*E8=1 +3*13=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40=3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nSo, each E_n corresponds to the sum up to 3^{n} where n starts from 0.\n\nWait, so E9= sum_{k=0}^1 3^k=4\n\nE8= sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=13\n\nE7= sum_{k=0}^3 3^k=40\n\nAnd so on, up to E1= sum_{k=0}^9 3^k= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*E1=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. The sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k from k=0 to n, which sums to (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, sum is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 multiplied by the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9), but actually, the sum up to 3^9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I end up with the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and multiple methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing a pattern where each layer is defined as $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$, starting from the innermost layer. Each layer can be expressed as a geometric series sum, leading to the formula $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the innermost layer (n=1), this sum is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach to verify. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). If I let x be the innermost term, then each layer is 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer. Since there are nine layers, this is like a recursive relation. But actually, in this case, each layer is dependent on the next, so it's more of a repeated multiplication. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, each Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the numbers are manageable, I think my step-by-step approach was correct. Alternatively, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1's. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have nine layers. So, my initial calculation seems correct.

Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. Continue this process for each layer, working from the inside out.\n4.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because when I was computing Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 3*29524: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, no, let me do it more carefully. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nBut wait, 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\nSo, the digits are 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that gives 88,572. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. So, 29524 *3 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\nMultiply by 3: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer computes to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation approach, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression inside is 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) which resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me define the expression as S, where S = 1 + 3S. Solving for S: S = 1 + 3S => S - 3S = 1 => -2S = 1 => S = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because each layer we computed was positive.

Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation here is linear, so maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, plugging into the formula: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can set up a system of equations:\n\n3A + B = 4\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nNow, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I even cross-verified using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form solution for this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer iteratively**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 24*3 = 72 Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me recall the formula for such a nested expression. If I have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ...)), it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my previous calculation. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula is solid. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can model each layer using a recurrence relation and solve it using a formula. \n\n1. **Define the layers**: Each layer \\( L_n \\) is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Find the general formula**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 Yes, that still adds up correctly. So, I think my answer is correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a geometric series or something similar here. Let's see. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated nine times, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time I compute it. Maybe that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of a recursive formula or a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me consider that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total can be expressed as a sum of a geometric progression.\n\nBut given that the expression is finite (nine layers), using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually to check.\n\nCompute a_4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches my earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Also matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems reliable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

    "text": ", 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in computing Layer 9 because 3*9841 is 29523, right? Wait, 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But wait, let me check each layer again because I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Let me try another approach: perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large so quickly. Let me check each multiplication step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication. Layer 9:1 +3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9841 *3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it down: 9841 *3: 1*3=3; 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1; 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2; 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2. But wait, 9841 is four digits, so actually, the digits are 9,8,4,1. So, 9*3=27, carry over 2; 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2; 4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1; 1*3=3 +1=4. So, 9841*3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 +29523=29524. Correct.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive formula checks out with the step-by-step approach.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So, yes, 88,572 seems correct. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, plugging in, we get a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute that: First, compute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplify inside the parentheses: 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} -1/2 = (9/2)*1 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} -1/2 = (9/2)*3 -1/2 =27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} -1/2 = (9/2)*9 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, we have a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} -1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561: Let's compute 9*6561 first. 9*6000=54000, 9*500=4500, 9*61=549. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500 + 549 = 59049. Then, 59049 divided by 2 is 29524.5. Now, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated. Using the recursive formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we compute up to \\( a_9 \\).
