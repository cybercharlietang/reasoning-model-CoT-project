Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, just computing each layer step by step is also feasible, though a bit tedious. But since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), it's doable. So, to summarize, the steps are: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). 3. Repeat until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result by 3.

I think this makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if there was only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Using the formula: a_1 = 4, 3*a_1 = 12. Correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, then 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, for three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Using the formula: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, then 3*a_3=120? Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, for three layers, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, layer 1:4, layer2:13, layer3:40, then 3*40=120. Wait, but using the formula: a_n where n=3: (3^{4} -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=40, so 3*a_3=120. But when I computed earlier, layer3 was 40, and then 3*40=120. Wait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, the formula holds.

The closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern in the a_n terms. Let me list them again: a1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4 a2 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13 a3 = 40 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40 a4 = 121 = (243 -1)/2 = 121 a5 = 364 = (729 -1)/2 = 364 a6 = 1093 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093 a7 = 3280 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280 a8 = 9841 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841 a9 = 29524 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524 So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, using the closed-form expression, I can compute a_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this. Let me denote each nested term as follows: Let\u2019s define E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(1) = 1 + 3\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(1)\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2)\n...\nE(9) = 1 + 3*E(8)\nAnd the total expression is 3*E(9)\n\nFrom earlier, we know E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nHence, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum:\n\nEach E(n) can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but wait, actually, no, because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Wait, 1 + 3 is 4, plus 9 is 13, plus 27 is 40. Yes, so E(3) = 40, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Similarly, E(4) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, in general, E(n) is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^n, which is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier formula. So, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, E(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer adds another power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, each time you go out a layer, you're effectively adding the next power of 3 multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Let me just stick with the step-by-step computation since it's manageable here.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost to the outermost, each time substituting the value of the previous layer into the next one. Then, after computing the outermost layer, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute the multiplication of 29524 by 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations.

Alternatively, if I had used the formula, I could have computed it directly without computing each layer, but since it's only 9 layers, it's not too bad either way. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers. Compute innermost first: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then, 3*40 = 120 Alternatively, using the formula: For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, then 3*40=120. Correct. If I compute manually: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 9)) = 3(1 + 3*10) = 3(1 + 30) = 3*31=93 Wait, wait, that's different. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my small example, I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), which is three layers. Let me compute step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 =4 Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) =13 Next layer: 1 + 3*(13)=40 Then, 3*40=120. But when I computed it as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), I think I miscounted the layers. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is three layers inside. So, innermost is 1 + 3 =4. Next, 1 + 3*4=13. Next, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. So that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=40, then 3*a_3=120. So, correct. Alternatively, if I compute it step by step as I did before, I get the same result. So, that gives me more confidence that my method is correct. So, applying the same logic to the original problem, which has nine layers, gives me 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the smaller example worked out, so I'm confident.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
