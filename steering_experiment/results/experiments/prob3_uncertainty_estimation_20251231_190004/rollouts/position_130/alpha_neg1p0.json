Wait, but let me confirm once more to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} where n is the number of layers. Wait, let me check that. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 So, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but actually, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1 = 4. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 13. So, Layer m is the sum from k=0 to k=m of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{m+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. Which matches the closed-form expression we found earlier. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.
