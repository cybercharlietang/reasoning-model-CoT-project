Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, only three layers. Let me compute that manually. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 Middle: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Outer: 3*13 = 39 Now, using the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 120. Wait, but manually, I got 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, for three layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 Middle: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Outer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's 120, which matches the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 120. So, my manual computation initially was incorrect because I forgot that the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression, which includes 1 + 3*middle. So, yes, it's 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. So, the formula works. Similarly, in the earlier case, when I thought I had 39, I was incorrect because I didn't include the outermost 1 + 3*... properly. So, the formula seems to hold.

    "text": " Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
