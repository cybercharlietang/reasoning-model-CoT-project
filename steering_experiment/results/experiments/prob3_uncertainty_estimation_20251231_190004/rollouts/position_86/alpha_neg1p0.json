    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check with another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I did earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: C*3^n + 3D + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, 0 = 2D + 1 => 2D = -1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression involving multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

But just to be thorough, let me check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let's denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define the layers more formally. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me see what this sequence looks like: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as computed earlier, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, to find a closed-form formula, let's consider the recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*(29524)=88572. So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, give the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: Let me break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), if k \u2260 1. In this case, k=3 and c=1. So, starting from a_1 = 4, which is the first term. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc. So, maybe the formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to verify. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like E = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). If we have n layers, then each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, for each layer, the value is 1 plus three times the previous layer. That seems to be the case here. So, for n layers, the value would be E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Let's assume that the expression stabilizes after many layers, so E_n = E_{n-1} = E. Then, E = 1 + 3E. Solving for E: E = 1 + 3E => E - 3E = 1 => -2E = 1 => E = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because all our layers are positive numbers. Maybe this approach isn't suitable here because the number of layers is finite. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it iteratively as I did before, which seems to give a valid result. Let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses inside. Wait, actually, when I counted the layers, I thought there were nine layers, but let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each time I have another layer. Let me count how many times I have 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1))\n3. (1 + 3*(2))\n4. (1 + 3*(3))\n... and so on until the ninth layer. Wait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, perhaps there are eight layers after the initial one. Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try again. Let's parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, nine layers in total, each computed as 1 + 3*previous layer, starting from Layer 1 = 4, then Layer 2 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's consider that each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. So, E_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for E_n is E_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's find B by assuming E_n = E_{n-1} = B. Then, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula approach gives the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to write this out in expanded form. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see how many terms there are. Each time we have a 1 and a 3 multiplied by the next layer. It seems like each layer adds a term of 3^k where k increases each time. Wait, perhaps if I write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. But maybe it's easier to see if I expand it step by step. Let me try to expand a few layers to see the pattern. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, regardless of the method, the result is the same. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each time we have 1 + 3*(something), which can be seen as adding 1 and then scaling by 3. But since each layer is nested, it's more of a recursive structure rather than a simple geometric series. However, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation was helpful. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Specifically, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's compute a few layers and see if there's a pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Do these numbers follow a particular sequence? Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write down the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the geometric series. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each additional (1+3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...): 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. ... 3. ... 4. ... 5. ... 6. ... 7. ... 8. ... 9. ... Wait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check for any possible miscalculations in the layers. Let me try computing each layer again, but this time, I'll write down each step clearly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach a_1 = 4. So, expanding all the way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Hmm, so each a_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n} plus 1. Wait, let me see: a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*a_0, but that might not be the right way. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can see that a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from a_1. Let me try to express a_n in terms of the sum. From the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding recursively: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3}, and so on. Continuing this way, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_0 would be undefined here. Alternatively, if we consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which fits. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*a_0. But since a_0 = 1, it would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same as what we found earlier using the recurrence relation. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1. a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 should be 13. Using the formula: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(a_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer.

A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, right? Wait, no. Wait, in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, which is a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So the entire expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation. So that's correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers increases. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Let me see if I can spot a pattern in the layers. The values are: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find the next term to see if we can find another equation. But perhaps it's easier to compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is a function of the previous term. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, if we can find a general formula for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, the answer is 88572.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, but actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is found by solving r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...), and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, if we have n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and the solution can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, let's consider the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. Then, B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer n as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, the recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute each a_n up to a_9 and then multiply by 3. a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a9, n=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. This method also leads to the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to verify. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let me find the general solution. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That makes me confident that the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a recurrence relation. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Let's also compute a_2 to find another equation. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, when n=2, a_2=13. Plugging into the general solution: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 -1/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Which matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2) is the same as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. 4. Use the formula to compute the value directly. 5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, perhaps I can find a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Hmm, I don't immediately recognize a pattern, but perhaps each term is related to powers of 3. Let me see: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Comparing with a_n: a_1=4, which is 3 + 1. a_2=13, which is 9 + 4. a_3=40, which is 27 + 13. a_4=121, which is 81 + 40. a_5=364, which is 243 + 121. Hmm, so each a_n is 3^{n} + a_{n-1}. Wait, but let's see: a_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1. a_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 4 = 9 + 4. a_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 13 = 27 + 13. a_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 40 = 81 + 40. a_5 = 364 = 3^5 + 121 = 243 + 121. So yes, it seems that a_n = 3^n + a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1. So, in general, a_n = 3^n + a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, expanding this, a_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^1 + 1. Wait, because each a_n includes all the previous terms. So, a_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but let's check: a_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. a_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. a_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k. The sum of a geometric series. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. Here, r=3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify with a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a geometric series. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. After computing all layers, the final value is 29,524, which, when multiplied by 3, gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to express it recursively. Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Here, n=9, because there are nine sets of parentheses. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if each layer follows a certain sequence or formula. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, each layer seems to be 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check: Layer 2 = 3*Layer1 +1 = 3*4 +1 =13, correct. Layer3=3*13 +1=40, correct. Layer4=3*40 +1=121, correct. So yes, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the general formula for Layer n is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1) +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) -3L(n-1)=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1)=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*Layer9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in exponentiation. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 3^11=177147 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is indeed 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That seems solid. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, and just computed each layer step by step, I still arrived at the same result, so that gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I've considered multiple approaches: computing each layer manually, recognizing the recurrence relation, solving it to find a closed-form expression, and then verifying with the formula. All methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a recurrence relation, which can be solved using a closed-form formula. The final result after evaluating all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} Substitute the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Good. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand it all the way, perhaps it's a sum of a geometric progression. Let me try to see: Starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) =1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, so each time, we're adding another term which is 3 times the previous total. So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to 9 terms, but actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, but let me check. If I have n layers, each adding a power of 3, then the total sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1, then next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9=1 +3^1 +3^2, and so on. So, for 9 layers, the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 2 layers, then each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. Wait, actually, each layer adds one more power. So, if there are 9 layers, the innermost is 1 +3^1, then the next is 1 +3^1 +3^2, and so on up to 1 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^9. But wait, in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds a multiplication by 3, which effectively adds another power of 3. So, the total inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. Because the innermost is 1 +3, which is 3^0 +3^1, then the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=3^0 +3^1 +3^2, and so on, up to 9 layers, which would be 3^0 +3^1 +...+3^8. So, the sum inside is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where r is the ratio and n is the number of terms. Here, r=3, n=9 terms (from 3^0 to 3^8). So, the sum is (3^9 -1)/(3 -1)= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Wait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 3*(sum up to Layer 8). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Each time, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, if I consider the innermost as Layer 1: 1 +3=4=3^1 +1. Then Layer 2:1 +3*4=13=3^2 +3 +1. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. So, each Layer n corresponds to sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, no, because Layer 1 is sum from k=0 to1: 1+3=4. Layer 2 is sum from k=0 to2:1+3+9=13. Layer 3: sum from k=0 to3:1+3+9+27=40. So, in general, Layer m is sum from k=0 tom of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 9 would be sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that matches my earlier computation. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k), that's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the pattern of nested expressions where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer corresponds to a partial sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. \n\nThe innermost expression is $1 + 3 = 4$. Each subsequent layer adds another term, effectively summing powers of 3. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the innermost sum to be $(3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let me denote L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Lh = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps the total expression can be represented as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, because L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, so 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again gives me the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Alternatively, I could try to find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by n_{k} = 1 + 3*n_{k-1}, starting with n1 = 4. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for this. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is n_k = 3*n_{k-1} + 1, with n1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is n_k - 3n_{k-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is n^{(h)}_k = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say n^{(p)}_k = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k = 1, n1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For k=1: n1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: n2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: n3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For k=4: n4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, n_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is k=9, so n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, n9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*n9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*n9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*n9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led to the same result. So, I'm ready to put the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*9 + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: (3/2)*3 + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59048)/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just check my calculations once more to be absolutely sure. Starting with a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. a_2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 3*a_9 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I had before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since our layers go up to n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 is 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the solution is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple times, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this recurrence relation, we can note that it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, we can find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous part. The non-homogeneous term is a constant (1). So, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That might be a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. So, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 fits. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my initial term is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so 3*a_9=88572. Either way, the answer is the same. So, I think I've got it right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014give me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. This looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me see. If we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, each layer is of the form a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. As we saw, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just confirm once more to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. 1+3*13=40. 1+3*40=121. 1+3*121=364. 1+3*364=1093. 1+3*1093=3280. 1+3*3280=9841. 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recursive approach or a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3\\), and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous result.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula:**\n   Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, the nth layer can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For Layer 9 (\\(n = 9\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   Then, multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
