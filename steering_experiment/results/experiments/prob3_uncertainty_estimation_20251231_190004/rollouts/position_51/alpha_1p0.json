    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, it would be 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check that multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 0*3=0, write 0. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Wait, that's the same as before, so 29524 * 3 is 88572. Hmm, but when I think about it, 3*29524, 29524 is approximately 30,000, so 3*30,000 is 90,000, so 88,572 is just a bit less, which makes sense. So, is that the final answer? 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 0*3=0, write down 0. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer and verifying with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a geometric progression. Using the closed-form formula for the nth layer, we find the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I compute 29524 * 3, I might have messed up the digits. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\nx      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it down, it's 88,572. So yes, 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because if any layer is wrong, the entire result will be off. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might be quicker. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand it all, it might form a geometric series. Let me try to see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) = 3*(1 + 3*(E')) where E' is the inner expression. Wait, but E' is similar to E but with one fewer layer. Since there are 9 layers, E' would have 8 layers, and so on. But maybe it's better to think recursively. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already solved that, maybe it's not necessary to go further. But just to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if it aligns. For example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe the entire expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to write it out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nIf I expand each layer:\n\nFirst, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, I think the answer is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that work? Let's compute it step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: For n=3 layers, a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = 81 -1 =80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Which is correct. Let me compute it manually:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the total sum after n layers would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, it's not exactly a sum; it's more like a recursive multiplication. But the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems to handle it correctly.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is built by nesting 1 + 3(...) nine times, and each time, you compute the innermost first. The result of each layer is used in the next outer layer. Finally, after computing the ninth layer, you multiply by 3 to get the final result. Using the formula, we found that the ninth layer is (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the smaller test case worked, so I think this is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 has only five digits, so when multiplying by 3, the result should be a five or six-digit number. Let me count the digits in 29524: 2,9,5,2,4 \u2013 that's five digits. So, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it correctly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, that seems off because 3 \u00d7 20000 is 60000, and 3 \u00d7 9000 is 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000, which is less than 88572. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this by another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). So, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nWe need to compute L_9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, but let me recall the correct formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems valid. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have L_9, let's compute that:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^10: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243, 243*3=729, 729*3=2187, 2187*3=6561, 6561*3=19683, 19683*3=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently. Using the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for the nth layer, we find the innermost layer and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Define \\( L_n \\) as the value of the nth layer.

So putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing from top to bottom: 8 (from the 2*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), then 7 (from 5*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), then 7 (from 5*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 2*3 + carryover), then 7 (from 5*3), and finally 2 (from 4*3). Wait, no, I think I messed up the order. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nDigit 3: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 4: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nDigit 5: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carryover 0.\n\nDigit 6: 9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n\nDigit 7: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write 7, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 8: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nDigit 9: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together from left to right: 8 (from digit 9), 8 (digit 8), 7 (digit 7), 8 (digit 6), 7 (digit 5), 8 (digit 4), 5 (digit 3), 7 (digit 2), 2 (digit 1). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. Wait, actually, 29524 is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when we multiply by 3, we should get a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. So, going back, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=1: f(1)=4, n=2: f(2)=1 + 3*4=13, n=3: f(3)=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a general formula for f(n), I can compute f(9) directly without computing each layer. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, this method also gives the same result, confirming that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it worked out as well. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. If I denote each Layer n as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my multiplication again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. Starting from the units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

So when I multiply 29524 by 3, I should get:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. But let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Because if any layer is incorrect, the final answer will be wrong.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...), and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So my calculation seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2713\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2713\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2713\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute a_1 to a_9 using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\na_1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4 \u2713\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2713\n\na_3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2713\n\na_4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\n\na_5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\na_6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\na_7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\na_8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\na_9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nAll match. So, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently. Applying this formula, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, ultimately multiplying the outermost result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Layers**: Using the formula, compute each layer from n=1 to n=9.\n\n5. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer result by 3.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6. 9 (thousands): 9 * 3 = 27. 5 (hundreds): 5 * 3 = 15. 2 (tens): 2 * 3 = 6. 4 (units): 4 * 3 = 12. So, adding the carries: Starting from the units: 12, so write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 6 + 1 = 7. Hundreds place: 15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place: 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands place: 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Wait, but let me verify that step-by-step computation because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me think about that. If we have a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is generated by this recurrence relation. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4. Let's compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if it matches the formula. For n=1: a(1) = 4. Using the formula: A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Formula: A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, layer 4: a(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is correct as per earlier computation. Similarly, layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula is a more efficient way to compute the result without having to manually compute each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and arrive at the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find the result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can write a small table to confirm the layers:\n\nLayer | Value\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nYes, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 887852? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Wait, maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\nSo, writing it out: 7 (from the 2\u00d73+1), then 7, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me write the digits as I compute them:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 7, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 hundred-thousands place is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, Layer 9 would be the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis can be solved as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27+1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15+2=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7 \u21927\n\nSo, writing it down: 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), then 7, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2? Wait, that seems off because the number should be 88572, which is 5 digits, but 29524 is 5 digits, so 3 times that would be 6 digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7 (from the 2\u00d73+1), then 7, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2? Wait, that would be 778572, but that's 6 digits. But 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572, which is 5 digits. Wait, I must have miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is 5 digits: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 units:2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6+1=7 \u2192 tens:7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27+1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6+2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands:8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, which is 5 digits: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I computed each layer step by step, then used a recurrence relation to confirm the value of Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. I also double-checked the multiplication to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the problem, I thought it was 3 multiplied by a sum that had nine layers. So, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside. Then inside, we have (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Each time, it's a new layer.\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, up to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer. So, yes, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses, so when I multiply by 3, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct. Let's say I have a similar expression with fewer layers, say 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct. Now, let's compute using my layer approach:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, total expression: 3*Layer2 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, with 3 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nTotal expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach seems to work for smaller numbers, so I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, my final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more, because sometimes when I'm dealing with a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error.\n\nSo, let me list each layer's value:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nTherefore, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1.\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute any layer directly without having to compute each step, which is efficient. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 (the next digit) * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, 29524 is 2 digits: 2 and 9, 5, 2, 4? Wait, no, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, breaking it down digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Alternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think about this expression in terms of a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but more quickly this time, just to see if I can get the same result without making any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. 1+3*13=40. 1+3*40=121. 1+3*121=364. 1+3*364=1093. 1+3*1093=3280. 1+3*3280=9841. 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yep, same result. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we determine each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula confirms the result. The final computation gives the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire expression, which includes 9 layers. So, I think my approach is correct. But let me try another way to see if I can get the same result, maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of a geometric series or using a formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's define each layer recursively. Let\u2019s denote S_n as the value of the nth layer. So, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 S_4 = 1 + 3*S_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 S_5 = 1 + 3*S_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 S_6 = 1 + 3*S_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 S_7 = 1 + 3*S_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 S_8 = 1 + 3*S_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 S_9 = 1 + 3*S_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for S_n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for S_n. Each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1} Let's assume S_n = A*3^n + B. Then, S_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, S_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition S_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: S_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: S_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: S_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers. So, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 243*200=48600, 243*40=9720, 243*3=729. Adding them up: 48600 + 9720 = 58320, plus 729 is 59049. Correct. So, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula.

So, 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me check: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which affects all subsequent steps. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nOkay, so each step checks out.

But wait, let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply 29524 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it earlier, I thought 29524 * 3 is 88572, but when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, that was incorrect because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, but when multiplying by 3, each part should be multiplied individually. Wait, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps. Let me list them out with their computed values: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait a minute, this seems like a pattern similar to powers of 3. Let me check: 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3^2 + 4, 40 is 3^3 + 13, 121 is 3^4 + 40, etc. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of 3^n. Let's try to find a general formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me rearrange the equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. To solve this, we can note that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test it with n=1: L_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But L_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the general solution is different. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes even if the method is correct, arithmetic errors can occur. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 200*243 = 48,600; 40*243 = 9,720; 3*243 = 729. Adding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Correct. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 29,524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but let me check my computations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to generalize it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as I computed. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure my formula works. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation of 121. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed using the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

But let me double-check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Maybe I should recompute each layer step by step again to be safe. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*L_9. So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses. 2. Compute each layer by substituting the value from the previous layer. 3. Multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation gives the same result without computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially for larger n. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29,524.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time you have a term that's 1 + 3*something. This resembles a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try that. Let\u2019s define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent L_n is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. The next digit is 9, but wait, 29524 is 2 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, maybe I should write it as 29,524? Let me clarify: 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572.

But wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a sequence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for a geometric series. In this case, k=3 and c=1. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^n - 1). Let me verify that. For a recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 = some initial value, the solution is a_n = c/(k-1)*(k^{n} - 1) + a_0*(k^{n}). Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, as Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4. So, maybe the formula would be a_n = (1/(3-1))*(3^{n} - 1) + 4*(3^{n-1})? Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The standard solution for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients is a bit different, but in this case, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, we can compute each term up to a_9, which is what I did earlier, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. But maybe using the formula would save time. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, that's correct. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute it using the formula for the recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation formula give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems right. But let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 would actually be 1 + 3 = 4, as I did before. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This leads to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. The next digit is 9: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 0 * 3 = 0, but since it's the leading digit, it's 0. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it as 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me verify each step because that seems like a lot of computation, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second, when I was computing Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Let me check that multiplication: 9841 * 3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841 * 3: 3, carry 0; 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1; 8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2; 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2; but wait, 9841 is four digits, so 9 (thousands place) *3=27, plus carryover 2 would be 29. So, it's 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. Correct. So, that seems right. Then, 29,524 * 3: Let me do it another way to confirm. 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my earlier steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but I feel like that's a big number. Maybe I should check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", so let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's Layer 1. Each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, there are eight more \"1+3(...)\" expressions. So, total layers from innermost to outermost would be nine, which is what I computed earlier. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, that seems correct. Therefore, my calculation of 88,572 should be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.

Wait, no, 29524 is actually a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying by 3, the digits would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry0.\n\nSo the result is 8 8 7 5 7 2, but that's 6 digits.

When I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.

So that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K -3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 =3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of which is 1 plus 3 times the previous one. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to ensure that my initial step-by-step approach didn't have any errors.\n\nCompute a_1 using formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll correct. So, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers manually using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor example, a_4: formula gives (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation of 121. Good.\n\nSimilarly, a_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and used two different methods to arrive at the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, which seems correct. So, I think the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms (only 9 layers), computing each step manually might be easier. However, for completeness, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. So, this formula seems correct. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and even derived a general formula to solve it, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So putting it all together: 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Okay, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the first 3, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3))))))))) Wait, so actually, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", and then the outermost 3 times that. So when I was computing up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have miscalculated somewhere. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each layer's computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should indeed be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSet this equal to A*3^{n} + B:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked each layer and even derived a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form formula, which confirms that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. 2 (the first digit) * 3 = 6, write 6.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 30000 * 3 is 90000, and 476 * 3 is 1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. But earlier, I thought it was 682872, which is way larger. I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15.

I must have miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let's compute it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

So that's 88572. Wait, that makes sense because 29524 is approximately 30,000, so 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be a bit less, which is 88,572. So my initial digit-by-digit calculation was wrong because I misaligned the digits. So the correct multiplication is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. We know that Layer 1 = 4, so plugging in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A=0. But since each layer is finite, maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively, which is what I did earlier. But just to confirm, let's see if we can express Layer n in terms of 3^n. Let me try computing the first few layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*(9 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*(27 + 9 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each Layer n is equal to 3^n + 3^(n-1) + ... + 3^1 + 1. Wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. But in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is 3^1 + 1. Layer 2 is 13, which is 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. Layer 3 is 40, which is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. Wait, but Layer 1 is 4 = 3 + 1, which is 3^1 + 1. Layer 2 is 13 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. Layer 3 is 40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. So, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, for Layer 1, n=1, sum from k=0 to 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which matches. For Layer 2, sum from k=0 to 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that formula. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so sum = (3^(n+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So yes, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9, so Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly computed Layer 9 as (3^10 -1)/2 and then multiplied by 3. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric series pattern. The outermost layer is computed as (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the recursive formula seems consistent. Now, since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, no. It's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step, verifying each result. Then, I recognized the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, solved it using the method for linear recurrences, and applied the initial condition to find the closed-form formula. Plugging in n=9 gave me the same result as the step-by-step computation. Finally, multiplying by 3 gave the final answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute the expression using another method or verify with a calculator, but given the consistency in my step-by-step approach and the closed-form solution, I think it's safe to say that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering how each layer is multiplied by 3 and adds 1, it might make sense. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric series of sorts. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach backed up the step-by-step computation. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was computing Layer 9, I said it's 1 + 3*(Layer 8) where Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3 * 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=9 is correct. Let me count the layers again. Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(...). So, yes, n=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outermost is Layer 9, so a_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut actually, in this case, it's more like a geometric series with ratio 3, but let me see.\n\nWait, but the closed-form formula I found earlier gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, as before.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm miscounting the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" appear?\n\nLet me count: Starting from the innermost, each time it's \"1 + 3(...)\", so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", which means 9 layers, each corresponding to a_n for n=1 to n=9. So, yes, the outermost layer is n=9, and the value inside is a_9 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the layers up to n=9 match my earlier calculations. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final value is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Let's consider that each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, for each layer, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, if we think recursively, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can also model this as a geometric series where each term is a_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + 1, but scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, but according to the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but multiplied by 1/2. Wait, the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what we have. So, each a_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\).

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought 29524*3 is 88572, and that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them again: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(... nine times ...))) So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, the process is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3: 2 * 3 = 6 (ten thousands place) 9 * 3 = 27 (thousands place, write 7, carry over 2) 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 (hundreds place, write 7, carry over 1) 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 (tens place) 4 * 3 = 12 (units place, write 2, carry over 1) But wait, since it's the units place, the carry over would go to the next digit, but there are no more digits.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 2, so we write that down.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number.

Wait, that doesn't match my previous thought. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAlternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Is that correct? Let me verify the layers again, because if that's wrong, the final answer will be off.\n\nStarting over, computing each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation for Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let's compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I think I accounted for all nine layers correctly. Each layer is computed correctly, so the result should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote the expression starting from the innermost as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found. In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a formula to compute the nth term directly. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine the value of the innermost expression and multiply by 3 to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that would make it easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. I think this method is more efficient because once you recognize the pattern and derive the formula, you can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work, but the formula is definitely faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. This forms a recurrence relation which can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Using that formula, we find that the innermost layer (a_9) is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But wait, I just realized that the original problem is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
