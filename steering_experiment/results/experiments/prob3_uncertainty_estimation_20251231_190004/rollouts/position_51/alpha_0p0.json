So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*9841, which is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to miscount or make a calculation error.

Each step builds upon the previous one, and the calculations check out.

So, 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check 29524 * 3 in another way. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric series, but since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the problem only requires computing up to a_9, it's probably quicker to compute each term step by step rather than finding a closed-form formula. However, for completeness, let's try to derive a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure that the result is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Each step seems to follow correctly. Let me verify a couple of layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I've got it right. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I guess another way to look at it is recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or something, but since each term is defined based on the previous one, it's more of a recursive computation. But either way, computing each layer step by step seems to work fine. I don't think there's a formula shortcut here because each term depends on the entire previous expression, not just a simple multiplication.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0*(r)^n)/(1 - r). Wait, but since r \u2260 1, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0*(r)^n)/(1 - r). However, in our case, the recurrence starts at a_1 = 4, which is after the first multiplication. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the number of layers. There are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps the value can be represented as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. From the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1? Wait, no, because the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3. So, perhaps a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test it with n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Good. Now, let's check n=2: a_2 should be 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since the outermost layer is Layer 9), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So, same result.

So, the final answer should be 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced errors. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis looks like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the first few layers:\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each L_n seems to follow the pattern L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L_1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches L_2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 holds true for each layer. That's a useful pattern. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L_9 directly.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct result. I didn't make any calculation errors in my step-by-step computation, and the formula approach confirms it as well.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. Wait, 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, it's 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems to be the answer. But to be thorough, let me check the calculations for each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, each layer seems to be correctly calculated. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, which might help verify the result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive structure where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct). For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct). For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 (correct). For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 (correct). For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 (correct). For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 (correct). For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 (correct). For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 (correct). So, the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the answer without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. In summary, by recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula for the nth layer, I was able to compute the value efficiently and verify the result using two different methods: step-by-step computation and applying the general formula. This gives me confidence that the answer is indeed correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see. Let's try to find a pattern or perhaps recognize it as a geometric series.

The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say Ln^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2 holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*[(3^10 -1)/2] = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I had to compute it step by step for understanding, I think the step-by-step approach is clearer for someone learning it. So, to recap, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4. Then, after computing the 9th layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\n3*29524=88572\n\nYep, all steps check out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building a number in base 3 or something, but I think the step-by-step computation is straightforward enough.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as a geometric series, but given the nesting, it's a bit different. However, the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation is spot on, so I think that's the most efficient way to approach it.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer from the inside out, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I feel confident about this result after verifying each step and cross-checking with the general formula.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it.

Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute the nth term without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works.\n\nGiven that, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a geometric progression, but in this case, the formula approach was more straightforward once I recognized the recurrence.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding the general formula for the nth term of the recurrence, I arrived at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, putting it all together, the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is built by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems to follow a pattern where each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Wait, actually, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer (Layer 9) would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which was 29524. 3. Multiplied this result by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. 4. Additionally, derived a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, which confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. 5. Verified the multiplication step to ensure accuracy.

Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer's computation seems correct, and the final multiplication checks out. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. The expression inside is a geometric series or something similar? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed before. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1 and the outermost being layer 9, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers: Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous term), which resembles a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. This seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying, we have:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation.\n\nLet me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yes, it works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since I already have the closed-form, I think that's sufficient. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I had before. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substitute a_{n-1} = C*3^{n-1} + D: a_n = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. But according to the general solution, a_n = C*3^{n} + D. So, equating both sides: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C + (-1/2) = 4. Solving for C: 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 -1/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, computing each layer step by step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using either iterative computation or recognizing the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. The final result after multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but when I first did the layers, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using exponents.\n\nThat's a much faster method, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case it's needed for a more complex problem.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using a closed-form formula. Applying this formula or computing step by step leads to the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can evaluate it by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 earlier. Let me go through the layers again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the calculations seem correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's a linear recurrence relation. If I were to generalize it, maybe I could find a formula for the nth term, but since n=9 here, computing each step is straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers. The values are: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and the general formula, we arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is a reliable method, albeit a bit tedious. Either way, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation or directly computing each layer, we determine the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carrying. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+\", that's a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then moving out, each \"1+\" adds another layer. So the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and each \"1+\" is a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+\" terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me verify: Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward one step. So, Layer 1: 1+3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check for a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me check if that applies here. In this case, k = 3, c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. We know that a_1 = 4. So, plugging that in: a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. So, a_9 = (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 9*6000 = 54000, 9*500=4500, 9*60=540, 9*1=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (9*6561)/2 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. But perhaps the formula I used earlier is more appropriate. In any case, both methods give me the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n3. Use the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} to compute each layer.\n4. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3.\n5. Verify the result using an alternative method (the formula for the recurrence relation) to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that each step was correct. I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work sufficiently. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Hmm, the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe each layer is building on the previous one. Let me try to represent it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer (Layer 9) equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially since it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer I got by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula. The final computation gives us the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = (3*59048)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, but both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up to a geometric series. But the step-by-step approach worked fine, and the recurrence relation method also led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way up.

Wait, let me check that again because when I did the multiplication step by step, I think I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which is similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on up to a_9. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Next, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me verify each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find L2 using the recurrence: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula, L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^(10))/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let's think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand it all the way, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1, but wait, actually, since each layer is 1 + 3*(...), the expansion would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which would result in a sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but actually, no, because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's more like a geometric series with ratio 3, but let me check. Let me try to see if I can express L9 in terms of a geometric series. From the recurrence relation, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc., and we found that L9 = 29524. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, but each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Let's compute that sum: Sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's L8, which we computed earlier as 9841. So, L8 = 9841, which is the sum up to 3^8. Then, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, which is correct. So, in general, Ln = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, for n=1, L1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but that's not matching because L1 is 4. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach was better. Alternatively, perhaps the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, which is L8. So, L8 = 9841, then L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple approaches all lead to the same result.

Compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, expanding the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, expanding: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, applying this to nine layers should be correct, leading to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one, ultimately resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I did 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which is correct. So the final step is indeed 3*29524=88572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3a_p + 1 => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59048)/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since the expression is a finite geometric series, maybe we can express it as such. Each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but it's finite. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's a bit different. Wait, actually, the expression a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. But in our case, n=9 layers, so the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Wait, let me check that. Let's take a small n to test. For n=1: a_1=1+3=4. If we expand as 1+3=4, which is 1 + 3^1. For n=2: a_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3*4=13. If we expand as 1 + 3 + 3^2=1 +3 +9=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=1 +3*13=40. Expanding as 1 +3 +9 +27=40. Correct. So yes, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, because the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^{n+1}-1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum = (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which again matches. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

When I compute each layer, I'm multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. If I have a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, for each n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that matches. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Correct. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, just for practice, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's see. Suppose I have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with n layers. Each layer is of the form a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the general formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, yeah, 88572 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the outermost layer results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
