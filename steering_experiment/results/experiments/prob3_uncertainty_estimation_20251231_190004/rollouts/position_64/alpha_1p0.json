    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because sometimes when you compute step by step, you might make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series, but since each term is nested within the previous, it's more of a repeated multiplication. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using recursion or recognizing a pattern. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive formula. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous result. So, this method also leads to the same answer.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88, 572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check each layer computation because I might have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses: Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the outermost layer, which is 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1 + 3(...). Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which we computed as 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Total: 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, 3 * 29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nL_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: A*3^n + 3B +1.\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B +1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2=4.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 3A=4 + 1/2=9/2.\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 =60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because I don't want to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, seems solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, we can write this recursively. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2. Let me check: 13 = 3*4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10? No, that's not right. Wait, 3*4 is 12, 12 +1 =13. So, perhaps it's 3*L(n-1) +1? Wait, no, L(n) =1 +3*L(n-1). So, maybe it's better to model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = a^(n) * L(0) + b*(a^(n) -1)/(a -1). Wait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. For a recurrence relation of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n -1)/(a -1). But in our case, L(1) =4, so maybe L(0) would be something. Wait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me think: If L(1)=4, then for n >=1, L(n)=1 +3*L(n-1). So, to fit into the standard formula, which usually starts at n=0, I can set L(0) such that L(1)=1 +3*L(0). So, 4 =1 +3*L(0) => 3*L(0)=3 => L(0)=1. So, with L(0)=1, the general solution would be L(n)= a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n -1)/(a -1). Here, a=3, b=1, L(0)=1. So, L(n)=3^n *1 +1*(3^n -1)/(3 -1)=3^n + (3^n -1)/2. Let's simplify that: L(n)= (2*3^n +3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: L(1)=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L(9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've got it right. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped ensure that I didn't make any mistakes. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value at each step. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a formula for the nth term of the sequence, confirming the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification using a formula**: Recognizing the recurrence relation, we derive that Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524 Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the time I've already spent computing each layer, maybe that's overcomplicating it. But just to check, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. We have a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=0, perhaps a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4). So, a_0 = 1. Then, using n=0: a_0 = A*3^0 + B => A + B = 1. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and A + B = 1. Subtracting the second from the first: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from A + B = 1: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, let's compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check again. Wait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0. Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1. Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2. Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8. So, writing it down: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,752. Wait, that seems high. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 88,752. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's break it down: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. So, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me redo that step carefully: 29524 * 3: Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1. Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2. Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8. So, the number is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752, but when I added it up, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition again. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59,048 + 29,524. Adding the thousands: 59,000 + 29,000 = 88,000. Then, 48 + 524 = 572. So, total is 88,000 + 572 = 88,572. So, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me try another approach. Let's write it down properly:\n\n     29524\n   x    3\n   --------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I see. When I wrote down the digits, I must have miscounted the places. So, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check again because I feel like I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29,524 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent now. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 once more using another method. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20,000 + 3*9,000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, I'm definitely getting 88,572 as the final result. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for just 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, then the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to check out, and using the closed-form formula also gives the same result. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify this because earlier, when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.

So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 =87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C =1 +3C \u21d2 -2C=1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^{1} -1/2 \u21d2 4=3A -1/2 \u21d2 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result now. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, and even used a formula for the recurrence relation to confirm that the innermost layers compute correctly. Then, I multiplied the final layer by 3 to get the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct.

So, I think my initial calculation is right. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series. Wait, let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number, then L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{11} because the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the answer.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same number.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n3.

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly because if any layer was wrong, the final answer would be off. Let's go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like E = 1 + 3E, but that's only one layer. Wait, but in this case, each layer is E = 1 + 3E', where E' is the next inner layer. But since each layer is similar, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n as the value of the nth layer. So, E_1 = 1 + 3. E_2 = 1 + 3E_1. E_3 = 1 + 3E_2, and so on up to E_9. Then, the final answer is 3E_9. So, the recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for E_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is E_n = 3E_{n-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final answer is 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for E_n to compute E_9 directly and then multiplied by 3. But since I already did the step-by-step computation, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.

Now add them all up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because I'm a bit confused now. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. But let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing the expression in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, which results in 29,524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times this value, leading to the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me confirm all my steps again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. So starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, since the recurrence is nonhomogeneous, we can solve it as follows. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9 (the outermost layer), L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, the general term is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as a geometric series. Each layer is building up a geometric progression. Let me see. Starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, actually, in this case, the expression has a fixed number of layers, so it's not an infinite series, but a finite one. So, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series is not directly applicable, but the recurrence approach worked well. So, I think I'm confident that the result is 88,572. Just to recap, I computed each layer step by step, verified the pattern using a recurrence relation, found a general formula, and confirmed that the result is consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of the outermost expression. The final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In this case, a = 3, b = 1. Wait, but our initial term is L_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me consider L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, to apply the formula, let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is the particular solution. To find d, we can set L_n = d, which gives d = 1 + 3*d, so d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we determine that each layer can be computed step by step from the innermost to the outermost. Alternatively, a closed-form formula is derived using the properties of linear recurrence relations, confirming the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Then 3 * 29524: as before, 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Then substituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2= 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier result. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88752.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I had:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000  \n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000  \n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500  \n20 \u00d7 3 = 60  \n4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different. So which one is correct? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000  \nThen, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000  \nThen, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500  \nThen, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60  \nThen, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88752. There's a conflict here. I must have messed up the digit positions in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try that again, more carefully.\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from left to right, the digits are 8, 8, 7, 5, 2. So the result is 88,752.\n\nBut when I broke it down, I got 88,572. Hmm, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in the breakdown method. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\nSo, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000  \n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000  \n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500  \n20 \u00d7 3 = 60  \n4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but the digit-by-digit method gave me 88,752. There's a clear discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check both again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits in the digit-by-digit method. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \n= ?\n\nLet me write each digit:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)  \n9 (thousands place)  \n5 (hundreds place)  \n2 (tens place)  \n4 (units place)\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,752.\n\nBut when I broke it down, I got 88,572. Wait, that's different. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it directly.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nLet me compute each digit:\n\n2 (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6  \n9 (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27  \n5 (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15  \n2 (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6  \n4 (units place): 4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \n\nWait, but when you multiply each digit separately, you have to consider the place values. So, actually, it's:\n\n(2\u00d710,000) \u00d7 3 = 6\u00d710,000 = 60,000  \n(9\u00d71,000) \u00d7 3 = 27\u00d71,000 = 27,000  \n(5\u00d7100) \u00d7 3 = 15\u00d7100 = 1,500  \n(2\u00d710) \u00d7 3 = 6\u00d710 = 60  \n(4\u00d71) \u00d7 3 = 12\u00d71 = 12  \n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so the digit-by-digit method where I wrote 88,752 must be incorrect. I think I confused the place values. The correct result is 88,572. Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n________  \n= ?\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,752. Wait, but this contradicts the breakdown method. I'm getting confused here. Let me use a calculator to verify. Hmm, I don't have a calculator, but I can check the addition another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me add 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12.\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's 88,572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88,752. There must be a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check again:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8,8,7,5,2. So, 88,752.\n\nWait, but according to the breakdown, it's 88,572. I'm getting two different answers. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7       3  \n________  \n= ?\n\nLet me write each digit with its place:\n\n2 (ten thousands)  \n9 (thousands)  \n5 (hundreds)  \n2 (tens)  \n4 (units)\n\nNow, multiplying each by 3:\n\n4 (units) \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 (tens) \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 (hundreds) \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 (thousands) \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would make it 88,752. But the breakdown method gave me 88,572. There's a contradiction. I must have made a mistake in the breakdown method. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29,524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000  \n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000  \n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500  \n20 \u00d7 3 = 60  \n4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that's still 88,572. But the digit-by-digit multiplication seems to give 88,752. I must have a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Let me try again:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7       3  \n________  \n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the result from ten thousands to units: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 8 (ten thousands) would make it 80,000, plus 8,000 is 88,000, plus 700 is 88,700, plus 50 is 88,750, plus 2 is 88,752. But according to the breakdown, it's 88,572. There's a clear inconsistency. I must have made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29,524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it as:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7       3  \n= ?\n\nLet me compute each digit's contribution:\n\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d7 3 = 60,000  \n9 (thousands) \u00d7 3 = 27,000  \n5 (hundreds) \u00d7 3 = 1,500  \n2 (tens) \u00d7 3 = 60  \n4 (units) \u00d7 3 = 12  \n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nThis seems correct, but the digit-by-digit method is conflicting. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Wait, perhaps I confused the places when writing down the result. Let me try again:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the result:\n\n8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752.\n\nBut according to the breakdown, it's 88,572. I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 by adding 29,524 three times:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048  \n59,048 + 29,524 = ?\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\nTen thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAh! So the correct result is 88,572. That means the digit-by-digit multiplication must have had a mistake. Probably, I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88,752, but now, adding 29,524 three times, I get 88,572. So the breakdown method is correct, and the digit-by-digit multiplication was done incorrectly. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 again, carefully:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the result: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a contradiction. I must have made a mistake in the addition as well. Let me check the addition again.\n\n29,524 + 29,524:\n\n29,524  \n+29,524  \n________  \n= ?\n\nAdding units: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19. Write down 9, carry over 1.\n\nTen thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048.\n\nThen, adding another 29,524:\n\n59,048  \n+29,524  \n________  \n= ?\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\nTen thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88,572. So, in the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have made a mistake. Probably, I misaligned the digits when writing the result. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88,752, but the addition shows it's 88,572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem: after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. Therefore, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me double-check the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524  \n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   \n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   \n3.

Finally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So, writing it as 88572. Wait, but 29524*3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define the expression as follows: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was initially unsure, breaking it down layer by layer was a good approach.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but stepping through each layer was a good exercise to ensure I understood the process. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly, but each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous, which is exponential growth. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without going through each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check if this formula holds for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is a_1=4, and the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can compute each layer without manually calculating each step. That might have saved time, especially if the problem had more layers. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad. So, to wrap it up, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer, but just to be thorough, let me compute it again using the formula. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524.

Maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me define L_n as the nth layer. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for L_n. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nWhen n = 1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute L_9: 3^{10} is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So that's 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that seems correct? Let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check once more to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's actually a form of a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using both methods, I get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a geometric series. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested form where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together, we have 87, let me see: Starting from the right, the digits would be 2,7,5,8,8? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88,572. Wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me confirm: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. I think I've got it right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually, in case I have to solve a similar problem with more layers in the future. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous term. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The standard solution for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3=88,572. So, the closed-form approach confirms the step-by-step computation. This is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric series, but the recurrence approach worked well here. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying by 3 for the outermost expression yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let's do it step by step with proper alignment:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write 2 in the units place, carry over 1.\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write 7 in the tens place, carry over 0.\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5 in the hundreds place, carry over 1.\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write 8 in the thousands place, carry over 2.\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write 8 in the ten-thousands place.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with the breakdown method. Earlier, when I thought I got 88752, I must have miscounted the digits. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check that. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that confirms it. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, multiplied by 3, I got 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 88,572.

So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, as each step checks out. I even verified the multiplication at the end to ensure that 29,524 times 3 is indeed 88,572. So, I'm pretty confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +500 = 88548, +24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same answer. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the simplest way. But just to see if there's a pattern, let me see what each layer gives: Layer 1: 4 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 4*3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 13*3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 40*3 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 121*3 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 364*3 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 + 1 Hmm, so each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1, then L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, in general, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each L_n is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The closed-form formula is more efficient, but since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, I think the step-by-step approach is more illustrative for understanding how each layer contributes to the total. In any case, both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So each layer corresponds to each set. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or some other kind of sequence.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let me write that as a recurrence relation:\n\na(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a(n) = 3*a(n-1), which has the solution a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the closed-form formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then 3*a(n) =3*(3^(n+1)-1)/2=(3^(n+2)-3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*a(9)= (3^(11)-3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a(9)= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut in this problem, since n=9, it's manageable either way. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next nested term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form formula, which simplifies the computation. After calculating each layer and multiplying the outermost result by 3, the final answer is determined to be 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer } n = 1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Layer } (n-1))\n   \\]\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the layers we computed:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 88752. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So, 88752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572, which is different. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, let's try adding 29524 three times step by step:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 20000 = 49524\n\n49524 + 9524 = 59048\n\nNow, 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 88572.\n\nBut when I multiplied 29524 * 3, I got 88752, which is 180 more. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752.\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. There's a difference of 180. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my addition is wrong. Let me try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 again.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n9 + 9 = 18\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 (write 0, carryover 1)\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 (write 9, carryover 1)\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, it's 59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carryover 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carryover 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572, right? Because 30000 * 3 = 90000, so 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 29524 * 3 = 90000 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So, that must be correct. So, where did I go wrong in the multiplication earlier? I think I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8 \u2192 88752. But that's incorrect because the correct sum is 88572.\n\nWait, I think I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the product is 88752. But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. There's a discrepancy of 180. So, one of these must be wrong. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in adding 29524 three times. Let me try a different approach. Let's break down 29524 into parts. 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3 times that is 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut when I did the multiplication step by step, I got 88752, which is 180 more. So, I must have made a mistake in my multiplication process. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the product is 88752. But that's not matching with the addition. There's a problem here. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me try writing it again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n88752\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 29524 + 29524 + 29524 = 88572, which is different from 88752. I'm confused now. Maybe I need to check my initial calculations again. Let me go back to the layers. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier, which caused the final result to be off.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to see if I made an error there.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But earlier, when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I thought I got 88752, but now I'm realizing that must have been a mistake. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this by computing 3*(Layer 9) directly.\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute this carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8 \u2192 88752.\n\nWait, but earlier when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. Now I'm confused because the multiplication and addition are giving different results. There must be a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 again.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nLet me add them digit by digit:\n\n29524\n+29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the sum is 59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5, carryover 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.\n\nBut when I multiply 29524 by 3, I get 88752. There's a discrepancy of 180. This suggests that either my multiplication or addition is wrong, but both should give the same result. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 using a different method. Let's break down each number:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms that 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I multiply digit by digit, I get 88752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88752.\n\nWait, but that's not matching with the correct sum. There must be a mistake in the multiplication process. Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it properly, ensuring each digit is in the correct place:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place: 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, the product is 88752.\n\nBut this contradicts the addition result of 88572. I'm clearly making a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, the product should also have 5 digits. But 88752 is a 5-digit number, and 88572 is also a 5-digit number. Wait, but 29524 is less than 30000, so 3*29524 should be less than 90000, which both 88572 and 88752 are. But which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87000\n\n524 * 3 = 1572\n\nNow, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nAh, there we go! So, the correct product is 88572. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-wise multiplication? It seems I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me check:\n\nWhen I multiplied 9 (thousands place) by 3, I got 27, plus carryover 1 makes 28. So, I wrote down 8 in the thousands place and carried over 2 to the ten-thousands place. Then, 2 (ten-thousands place) *3 +2 = 8. So, the product should be 88752, but that's not matching with the correct sum.\n\nWait, no, because 29524 is 29,524, which is 2*10,000 + 9*1,000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1.\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n2*10,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9*1,000 *3 = 27,000\n\n5*100 *3 = 1,500\n\n2*10 *3 = 60\n\n4*1 *3 = 12\n\nAdding those: 60,000 +27,000 =87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nSo, the correct product is 88,572, not 88,752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication by misplacing a digit. Let me check again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 units:2, carryover1\n\n2\u00d73=6+1=7 \u2192 tens:7, carryover0\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover1\n\n9\u00d73=27+1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover2\n\n2\u00d73=6+2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing it as 88752, but this is wrong because the correct sum is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the carryover. Let me try again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 units:2, carryover1\n\n2\u00d73=6+1=7 \u2192 tens:7, carryover0\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover1\n\n9\u00d73=27+1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover2\n\n2\u00d73=6+2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the product is 88752, but that's incorrect. There's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the initial layer calculations. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. But earlier, when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I thought I got 88752, which was wrong. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer 9, I wrote it as 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, which is correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the digits in the multiplication. So, to avoid confusion, I'll just accept that 29524*3=88572, based on the addition method, which is more reliable in this case.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost expression and moving outward. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the layers**: The expression has nine layers of parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to model it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which again gives the same result. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something. When you have an expression like 3(a), where a is the entire nested expression, and a is 29524, then 3*a is indeed 88572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Maybe recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have nine layers. But just for knowledge, let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, layer n has value a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 88752? Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me correct that. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit properly:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together from right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten-thousands). So, 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572. But when I did it the other way, adding 20000*3, etc., I got 88,572 as well. So, the correct multiplication is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me verify my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to ensure each layer is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to make sure. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWait, so in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. It's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. It's good to know that both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to ensure there are no mistakes. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and both the iterative layer-by-layer approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\n=> K - 3K = 1\n\n=> -2K = 1\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so this formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since the original expression has 9 layers, let me see how many layers we're dealing with. Wait, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, which is a_1=4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute a_9 first.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 7, 5, 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry 1, 9 + 9 +1 =19, carry 1, 2 + 2 +1=5.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again, just to be sure. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster or more efficient. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, especially since it's non-homogeneous. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + d*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = d*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = A*d^n, where A is a constant. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (c), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = c + d*P. Solving for P: P - d*P = c => P*(1 - d) = c => P = c / (1 - d). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*d^n + P. Applying this to our problem: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so c = 1, d = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is P = 1 / (1 - 3) = 1 / (-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can find A using the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers from the innermost to the outermost), L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before, confirming that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I could have directly computed L_9 without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, each layer can be computed step by step. Additionally, a closed-form formula for the nth layer is derived, allowing efficient computation of the innermost and subsequent layers. Applying this formula confirms the result obtained through step-by-step computation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, no, let's check: 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nWe can write this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Therefore, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression.
