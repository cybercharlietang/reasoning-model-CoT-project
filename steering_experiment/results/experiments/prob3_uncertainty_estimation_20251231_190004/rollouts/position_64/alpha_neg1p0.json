Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, plus 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 88752? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match. I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it again more carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let's verify by another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524*3 again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method also leads me to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recurrence. Each term is built upon the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1.\n\nBut regardless of the method, both step-by-step computation and the recurrence formula give the same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, so that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I remember that expressions like this, which have repeated multiplication and addition, can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general formula for such a linear recurrence is known, right? It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous digit-by-digit approach. Hmm, so I must have messed up the digit positions earlier. Let me try the digit-by-digit method again, carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (from ten-thousands), 8 (from thousands), 7 (from hundreds), 5 (from tens), 2 (from units). Wait, that's 88752. But when I added it up as 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? Let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using standard multiplication:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   --------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572? Wait, no, according to this, it's 88572. But the digit-by-digit approach seems to give 88752. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nMultiply each digit from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the number is 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (from thousands), 7 (from hundreds), 5 (from tens), 2 (from units). Wait, that would be 88752, but when I added up the parts, I got 88572. I must be confusing the digit places. Let me clarify:\n\nThe number 29524 is:\n\n- 2: ten thousands\n- 9: thousands\n- 5: hundreds\n- 2: tens\n- 4: units\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But when I did the addition method, I got 88,572. There's a mistake here. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, the correct result should be 88,572. That means my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit, I thought the result was 88,752, but that's incorrect. Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752, but the addition method says it's 88,572. There's a conflict. I must be misaligning the digits. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     x       3\n     -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,752. But the addition method gave me 88,572. I must have made a mistake in the addition. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that's correct. So, why is the digit-by-digit method giving me 88,752? Let me check the digit positions again. Maybe I confused the places.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit multiplication, the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:8\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing it out, it's 88,752. But when adding up the components, it's 88,572. There's a conflict. I must have a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me verify 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nThen, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's correct. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me write it again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But the addition method says it's 88,572. This inconsistency is confusing. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check using another approach: compute 29524 * 3 using another multiplication method.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nMultiply each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,752. But according to the addition, it's 88,572. There's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check using a calculator. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nThen, 59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have had an error. Let me see where. Perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing down the result. Let me write the digits as I compute them:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:8\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But according to the addition, it's 88,572. Wait, perhaps I swapped the hundreds and thousands digits. Let me see: in the digit-by-digit method, after multiplying:\n\n- Units:2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:8\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). That would be 88,752. But when adding, it's 88,572. So, the correct result must be 88,572 because the addition method is straightforward and less error-prone. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method by misplacing the digits. Let me try to write the multiplication properly, aligning the digits:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     x       3\n     -----------\n             12  (4*3)\n            7    (2*3 +1)\n          15     (5*3 +0)\n        28      (9*3 +1)\n      8        (2*3 +2)\n     ---------------\n      8 8 7 5 2\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you write it down, the digits should be aligned properly. Let me write it as:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     x       3\n     -----------\n           8 8 7 5 2\n\nBut that would mean the digits are 8,8,7,5,2, which is 88,752. However, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again, carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be right because we start from the right. Wait, no, when you multiply, you write the digits from right to left, but the result is read from left to right. So, the first digit you write is the units, then tens, etc. So, the digits would be:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But according to the addition, it's 88,572. There's a contradiction. To resolve this, I'll compute 29524 * 3 using another method: break it into 29000 + 524, then multiply each by 3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87,000\n\n524 * 3 = 1,572\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I misaligned the digits. The correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29,524. Because if Layer 9 is incorrect, then everything else is wrong. Let me go back and check each layer computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct now. I just had a momentary confusion with the digit alignment earlier, but upon verifying with different methods, it's clear that 29,524 * 3 equals 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each term can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and still arrived at the same result. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer, so I can be confident that 88572 is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a formula for the nth layer, confirming our step-by-step result. The final computation gives the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back because I might have miscalculated one of the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure each step is correct.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I have a feeling that the answer might be different because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers or make a multiplication error. Let me check each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions like this, especially with so many layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure I have nine layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the opening parentheses as follows:\n\n- After the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), so that's one layer.\n\nEach time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...) -> Layer 1 inside\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) -> Layer 2\n3. Continuing, each time I enter another (1+3(...)), it's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- The first (1+3(...) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)) is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(....))) => Layer 1 inside.\n\nEach time we have a (1+3(....)), it's a new layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(.....\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(.....\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses:\n\n- The first one after 3 is the start of Layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another ( for Layer 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3, first ( starts Layer 1.\n2. Then inside that, another ( starts Layer 2.\n3. Another ( starts Layer 3.\n4. Layer 4.\n5. Layer 5.\n6. Layer 6.\n7. Layer 7.\n8. Layer 8.\n9. Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, it's 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that would mean there are 9 layers. So, my initial calculation was correct with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm by another method. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one.\n\nSo, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nThis is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can compute each L step by step as I did before, but perhaps there's a formula to compute L_n without computing each step.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where r is the common ratio, and b is a constant.\n\nBut let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check using the formula approach. Since each layer can be represented as L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let's try expanding the expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I denote the innermost term as T = 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*T, where T is the previous layer.\n\nBut since we have 9 layers, it's a bit involved, but the formula approach seems more efficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds a power of 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, no, that doesn't quite add up. Let me see:\n\nWait, Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, no, because 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1 = 27 +9 +3 +1=40. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1 = 81 +27 +9 +3 +1=121.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I'll compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with both step-by-step calculation and a formula approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards and applying the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, wait, when I did 29524 * 3, I think I made a mistake in the final digit. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15.

I think I missed a digit earlier. Let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought it was 87,572, but now I see it's 88,572. So I must have made an error in the first multiplication. Let me make sure: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15.

The correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes in the layers. Each layer was computed correctly, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3 at the end. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as computed earlier. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 each time, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be expressed as a sum of 3^n terms. But since each term is nested, it's more of a nested multiplication rather than a simple series. However, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each time we go one layer out, the value gets multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous +1. But since we already have a closed-form solution, maybe that's the most efficient way. In any case, after computing each layer step by step, I arrived at 88,572 as the final result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach to see if I can get the same result. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand this, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1, with each term having one more 3. But wait, that might not be exactly accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so when expanded, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would lead to 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... but the number of terms would correspond to the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, perhaps the expansion would have 9 terms? Let me check. Wait, no, because each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each outer layer adds another 3*... So, when fully expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, if there are 9 layers, the expansion would have 9 terms of 3^k where k ranges from 1 to 9, but I think it's more accurate to say that each layer contributes a term. Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try that. The expression inside the outermost 3 is a_9, which we found to be 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: The sum S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n, where a_1 = 3, a_2 = 3^2, ..., a_n = 3^n. But in our case, the expansion is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Wait, maybe not exactly a geometric series, but perhaps a modified version. Alternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier, then the expression 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it: 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. That's consistent with our earlier calculation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or represent it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer itself is 1 + 3*(its previous layer), it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern, we can use a formula derived from a linear recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. The outermost layer (n=9) is \\( \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This recurrence relation is a linear one, and perhaps it can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_0*(1 - r^{n})/(1 - r)), but actually, since a_1 is given, maybe the formula can be adjusted. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n can be written as a_n = (1 + 3^{n}) / (1 - 3), but let me check that. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches a_3. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Wait, 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same answer. That's a more efficient way, using the formula. But since I initially did it step by step, I think both methods are valid. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the value 29524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer of 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gave the same result more efficiently. Either way, the answer is consistent, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer.

Because each ( adds a new layer, and there are 9 sets of (1+3( starting from the first one. So, I think I did 9 layers correctly. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, each layer can be computed step by step. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using either iterative computation or a derived formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I compute nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of them.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a term that's 1 + 3 times something.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about it as a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4.\n\nWait, in our case, a_1 is 4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two methods confirm each other.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then, subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Layer5:1 + 3*121=364. Layer6:1 + 3*364=1093. Layer7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is feasible. However, if we had many more layers, we might need a formula. But for nine layers, it's okay. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88752. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake there.

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing from left to right, it's 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 7 (from 5*3), then 5 (from 2*3), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, when you write the digits, you start from the right, so the first digit you write is the units place, then tens, etc. So, actually, the digits would be: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten thousands).

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern by computing the first few terms. Let's see:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, this is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time. Alternatively, I can model this as a geometric series where each term is 3^n, but adjusted by the constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express Ln in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to write out the recursion:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, whose solution is Ln = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula is for Ln, which is the nth layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So, in our problem, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, L9 is indeed (3^{10}-1)/2, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let's see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Wait, but each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I consider that, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but since it's 9 layers deep, it might not form a standard recursive equation unless I adjust it properly. Alternatively, since I've already found a formula for each layer, maybe I can use that to find E directly. Since E is 3*(L9), and L9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before, so that's a good consistency check.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 177147 -3 = 177144, and 177144 divided by 2 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer), and the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer. I computed each layer step by step, which gave me L9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Then, I derived a general formula for Ln, which gave me the same result, and then using that formula directly, I arrived at the same answer. So, I think that's solid.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms it as well. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3(...): There are 9 instances of 1+3(...), so each layer is one of those. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1:1+3, then Layer 2:1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9:1+3*(Layer8). So that's correct, 9 layers. So, 29524 is correct for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nWait, actually, the solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is given by:\n\na_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in this case, our first term a_1 is 4, so we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me try to find a formula.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for the 9th layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.

Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach and a derived formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer is built on the previous one, so if I messed up any layer, the subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see if this is a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, and using the formula for a geometric series or the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation can save time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's good to know that a general formula exists for such problems.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we arrive at the value of the innermost expression, then work our way out, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach yield the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and eventually compute the entire expression.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that seems correct because 30000*3=90000, which is a bit more than 29524*3, so 88572 sounds right. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form expression for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to compute it, which confirms the answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

That seems correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe this expression is a geometric series or follows a pattern that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nSuppose I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^{10}=59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula approach, I also arrive at 88,572. That gives me more confidence that this is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and adds 1, the formula approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In this case, the ratio is 3, and each term adds 1. So, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series with adjustments for the added 1 each time.\n\nBut in this case, since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), computing each step manually or using the formula is manageable. If there were more layers, the formula would be more efficient, but for nine layers, either method works.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it all together: 8 (from 2*3+2) 8 (from 9*3+1) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3+1) 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me do it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Li. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is Li = a*Li-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is Li = a^{n} * (L0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, which is when n=1. So perhaps I can express it as Li = 3^{i} * L0 + 1*(3^{i} - 1)/(3 - 1). But I need to find L0 such that L1 = 4. Wait, L1 = 1 + 3*L0. So, 4 = 1 + 3*L0 => L0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, L0 =1. Then, the general formula would be Li = 3^{i} * L0 + (3^{i} - 1)/(3 - 1). Plugging L0 =1, we get Li = 3^{i} + (3^{i} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{i} + 3^{i} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{i} -1)/2 = (3^{i+1} -1)/2. So, Li = (3^{i+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with i=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. i=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. i=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, i=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time, especially if the expression had more layers. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

Wait, but let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(...)\". The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" terms: 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... Up to 9 times. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding another layer. So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, my computation seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I still get the same result, which reinforces that my initial computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.

The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's write it down: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on, up to a_9. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In our case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I believe. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a_1. Let me see. Let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n9/2 = 3*C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, we need a_9, because the outermost layer is Layer 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the entire expression. Let me think: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, in terms of the a_n, it's 3*a_9. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now. Each step checks out, and the different methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to verify our result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times the next term.

For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply \\(a_9\\) by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me write it out properly:\n\n    2 9 5 2 4\n  x        3\n  ------------\n    ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm that because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. So 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572. Let me check 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I wrote Layer 6 as 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093, but in my initial calculation, I wrote Layer 6 as 1093, which is correct. But then when I computed Layer 7, I said 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Wait, but 3*1093 is indeed 3,279, so 3,279 +1 is 3,280, which is correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000; 3*280=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 9,840 +1 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841: Let's compute 9,841 * 3. 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps are correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which seems like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches what I had before.\n\nSimilarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1)) + (a1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nPlugging in the values, c = 1, r = 3, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_n = (1/(3 - 1)) + (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (1/2) + (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} = (1/2) + (7/2) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_n = (1 + 7*3^{n-1}) / 2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging in n=1: a1 = (1 + 7*3^{0}) / 2 = (1 + 7*1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2 = (1 + 7*3^{1}) / 2 = (1 + 21)/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I had a2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, my formula must be wrong. Let me check my steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving the formula. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, that works. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nBut in the original problem, we have nine layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer is a1, a2, up to a9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(a9), where a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, no, because a1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then, a2 is the next layer, which is 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, because n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute a9 directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I already computed it both ways and got the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and there are nine sets of parentheses inside the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, the inner part is another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nSo, each time, we add another layer. Since the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first opening parenthesis is at position 2: 3(...\n\nThen, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, including the initial 3, that would be 10 layers? No, wait, the initial 3 is multiplied by the first layer, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, the first layer is 1 + 3*(...), which itself contains another layer, and so on, until the innermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the expression having 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go out one layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears as a separate term.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So, that would mean 9 layers. Wait, no, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, in total, how many layers?\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(layer9)\n\nWhere layer9 = 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nAnd layer8 = 1 + 3*(layer7)\n\nAnd so on, down to layer1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to layer9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed layer9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841, and 9841 was layer8. Let me just confirm that each layer is computed correctly.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I computed layer9, I got 29524, but when I multiplied that by 3, I got 88572, which seems a bit large, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute the nth layer without having to compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, layer9 would be:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that using the formula as well. Since L_9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, the outermost expression is 3*L_9, so:\n\n3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So putting it all together, we have 8, 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, let me write it correctly: The digits are 2 (from 29524's ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplied by 3: Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, to confirm, let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly accounted for all layers. The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count them again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The first innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times I computed layers: Layer 1: innermost (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: next one out (1 + 3*4) = 13 Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40 Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121 Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364 Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093 Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one manually. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. Looking at the layers: Layer n: 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can find a particular solution and the general solution. Alternatively, recognizing that each term is of the form a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe another approach. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent a_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without calculating each layer. That's a good check. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula for the nth term, which gave me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" instances, each nested deeper. Wait, but when I counted the layers earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, but perhaps the outermost is Layer 9, which is inside 3(...). So, maybe the initial 3( is outside Layer 9. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each being 1+3(...), and the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that gave me 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be generalized, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it more efficiently than computing each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each layer is multiplied by 3, we can see that the expression is a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a finite number of terms (9 layers), the formula applies directly.\n\nWait, but I think I've already confirmed it sufficiently through both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying through different methods, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 87572? Let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572? Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to confirm. Let's break 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, so 29524 * 3 is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because that's a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: Let me compute that to be sure.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so:\n\n9841 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2. But there's no more digits, so we write 29. So 9841*3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093: 1093*3=3279, correct. Then Layer 7 is 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3280*3=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 9841*3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers because each time it's 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost 1 +3. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. So, yes, that makes sense. So, 88572 should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then each a_n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to find the pattern.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, solving the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula applies correctly. Since a1 corresponds to n=1, and the innermost term is a1=4. Then, each subsequent layer increases n by 1. So, the outermost layer is a9, which is correct. Therefore, the formula works, and the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, recalculated using a formula, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but let me cross-verify with another method. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then, subtract the difference between 30000 and 29524, which is 476. So, 29524 = 30000 - 476.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me verify this multiplication to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, because it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 87572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. We can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, this method also gives the same result. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've solved the problem correctly by computing each layer step by step and then verifying it using a recurrence relation approach. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it would have been impractical for a larger number of layers. So, learning to recognize such patterns is pretty useful.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about that. The general form seems to be a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by that recurrence. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's exactly what I did earlier. Now, to find a closed-form solution, let's solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.

Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we can compute it using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.
