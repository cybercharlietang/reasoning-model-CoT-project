    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check again because I think I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error there. Let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As above, that's 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me check that multiplication again because sometimes when you do it step by step, you might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*29524 as follows:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time we add another (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each computed correctly, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 once more.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2 \u2192 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way.

Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

So, writing it all together: 8 (from the 2*3 + 2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that would be 88572?

Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) =1 +3=4. Then, each layer is f(n) =1 +3*f(n-1). So, f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, f(9)=29524, as I found. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's try to solve the recurrence relation f(n) =1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) -3f(n-1)=1. The homogeneous equation is f(n) -3f(n-1)=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n)=A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n)=C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n)=f_h(n) + f_p(n)=A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2. Alternatively, f(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1)= (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: f(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, recurrence relation, and a closed-form formula. All lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go through each layer again step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just for curiosity's sake, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without computing each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large, it's manageable either way. But it's good to know the general formula for such nested expressions. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation formula, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another term)}\\).

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I know that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term. So, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my layers because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's define L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general form for such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(1) - b/(1 - a)) * a^(n-1) + b/(1 - a). Let me recall the formula for linear recurrence relations. For L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^(n-1)*L(1) + b*(a^(n-1) - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*a^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L(n) = C*a^n + K. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*a^1 + K => 4 = C*a + K. We already have K = b/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = C*3 + (-1/2) => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2). Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the same result as before, but this time using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids repetitive calculations. But since the problem only had 9 layers, either method works. However, recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation is a powerful approach for more complex or larger problems. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I did this up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my calculation of Layer 9 as 29524 seems correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the right answer.

It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is of the form:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nWith nine layers. So, each layer is defined by E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on up to E9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for E_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3*C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, E9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the computation of 3*29524 once more.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2.\n\nThus, 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, right? Let me verify each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, just to see if I get the same result. Let me try that. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I did before, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps it's the same as computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general form for such a linear recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me verify that 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, because 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each step because sometimes when you compute layers, it's easy to make an error. So starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So each layer is correct, so the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the innermost expression is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, perhaps I can compute the expression step by step without using the recurrence relation. Let me try that again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the initial step-by-step computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's see if the method works here.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: n=3 layers.\n\na_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Wait, but when I computed manually, I got 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, in this smaller problem, how many layers are there? The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but when I compute step by step manually, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120.\n\nBut when I thought I was computing it earlier, I thought I got 39, which was wrong. So actually, the correct result is 120, which matches the formula. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier quick calculation. So, the formula works.\n\nAnother test: compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). So, innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Using the formula: n=2 layers. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*a_2=39, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work correctly. Therefore, in our original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, everything checks out. I think I've got the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\) where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let's go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the values are growing exponentially, as expected. Now, the problem is asking for 3*L9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) is (3^10 -1)/2, so 3*L(9)=3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. That's pretty cool. So, in conclusion, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it more carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, 2 in the units place, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3 times that is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let's count: The first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: There's 1 + 3(...), so each ( is a new layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first one: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( after that, so 2.\n3. Continuing, I think there are 9 layers in total because each time we add a (, it's another layer. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88,572. So, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can represent this expression recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for each n, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Let's compute f(1) to f(9): f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, layer by layer, just to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive function. Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven f(1) = 4, let's solve for A and B.\n\nf(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nFor n=1: 4 = A*3 + B.\n\nAlso, for n=0, if we consider f(0) = 1 (since if there are zero layers, it's just 1), then f(0) = A*1 + B = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 4 = 3A + B\n2. 1 = A + B\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n4 - 1 = 3A + B - (A + B) => 3 = 2A => A = 3/2.\n\nThen, from equation 2: 1 = (3/2) + B => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both the recursive step-by-step method and the formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis looks like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches my earlier computation. So, L_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem using the formula to see if it works. Let's take a smaller number of layers, say 2 layers.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nFirst, innermost: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*13=39.\n\nUsing the formula: For 2 layers, n=2. Wait, no, in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is 3*(L_2), where L_2=13. Using the formula, L_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, 3*13=39, which is correct.\n\nAnother test: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4.\n\nNext layer:1+3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1+3*13=40.\n\nMultiply by 3:3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: n=3 layers inside, so L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40. Then, 3*40=120 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when I compute multiple layers, I might have made an error in one of the steps.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing from the last multiplication to the first: 8 (from the 2*3), then 8 (from 9*3), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3), then 2 (from 4*3).

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - (476 * 3). Compute 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake there, the final answer would be wrong.

So, I think I did each step properly. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression, actually. Because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have a term like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I'm dealing with a finite number of terms (nine layers), computing each step manually as I did is feasible. Alternatively, I could express this as a geometric series. Let me try to find a pattern or formula to compute it without having to calculate each layer. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + r^n * (a_0)/(1 - r), but wait, actually, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Alternatively, since this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, the solution can be found as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P\nP - 3P = 1\n-2P = 1\nP = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get there without computing each layer. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable. However, it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions, which can save time if the number of layers is large. In any case, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Each layer's value is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I didn't see any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just verify one more layer to be thorough. Let's check Layer 6: Layer 5 is 364, so Layer 6 should be 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 123=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can use another approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a geometric progression. Let me see. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm pretty sure that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 24 + 24 = 48, write down 8, carry over 4. 2 + 2 + 4 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0. 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.

Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing up to a_9 gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that solidifies the answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and computing each layer step by step, and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same answer, and each step checked out when I went through them individually.

Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a base case of a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see how many terms we have. Since the original expression has nine layers, that would correspond to a_9, right? Because each layer is a term in the sequence. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3 at the very end. Let me compute the terms again using the recurrence relation to confirm:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did before. So, the outermost term is a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost term before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods converge to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result into the expression 1 + 3*(result). After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together, we get 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the form 1 + 3*(...), which suggests a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recursion as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me see.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3 * (...).\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3 * Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive computation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:  \n   Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:  \n   Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3.

Wait, let me check that again because I think I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n----------  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's do it another way to confirm. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let's compute 3\u00d7364: 3\u00d7300=900, 3\u00d760=180, 3\u00d74=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. 3\u00d71000=3000, 3\u00d790=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7200=600, 3\u00d780=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Let's compute 3\u00d79841. 3\u00d79000=27000, 3\u00d7800=2400, 3\u00d740=120, 3\u00d71=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I was computing the innermost one first, which is correct. So each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, the process seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me consider that. If I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that seems like a lot. Let me recompute each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can compute it manually as I did before, which I already did. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let's see, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Each time, it's like adding another 3^k term. Wait, but I think the formula approach is more straightforward here. So, in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each term is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous term).

Let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let's see, the expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with nine layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer n can be expressed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_{n-1} is the result of the previous layer. If I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time in the future, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me try to find a pattern or a recursive formula here. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n is 1 more than three times the previous term. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form solution. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4})/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^{5})/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Let me verify this multiplication with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 1500 + 72 = 1572. Now, adding 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.

So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. Let me check if each layer was correctly computed.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000 *3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for this problem since it's only 9 layers. But just to check, maybe the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me see. Let's see for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric series. Let me think: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. Let me see if there's a pattern in the a_n values: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me some time. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=1, f(1)=4; n=2, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13; n=3, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40; and so on, up to n=9. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a closed-form expression for f(n), that might make it easier. Let's see if we can find a general formula for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be found by assuming f_p(n) = B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, each layer's value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which as we saw, gives the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as n=1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That might have saved time, especially if the expression was longer. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to use a recurrence relation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).
