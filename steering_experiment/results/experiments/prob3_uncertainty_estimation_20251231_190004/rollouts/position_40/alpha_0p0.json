Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nLet me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut in this case, the inner expression is similar to E/3, but not exactly because the nesting is different.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I define E as the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut the inner part is similar to E/3, but let's see:\n\nLet me denote the inner expression as F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThen, E = 3*F.\n\nBut F = 1 + 3*F', where F' is another similar expression.\n\nWait, but in our case, the nesting is finite, with 9 layers. So, perhaps this approach isn't as straightforward because it's a finite nesting rather than infinite.\n\nBut if I consider the finite case, maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, since we already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we found that a_9 = 29524, and E = 3*a_9 = 88572, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. The ninth layer result is 29,524.\n5. Multiply this result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time I compute it. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom, it's 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, I computed each layer correctly, ending up with 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's an opening parenthesis, then inside that, another 1+3(, and so on. Let's count the number of times we see \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time we add another layer. How many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, which is the last 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each layer wraps around the previous one. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, yes, there are 9 layers. So, my computation from layer 1 to layer 9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe using a geometric series or some formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with 9 layers. Let me think if there's a pattern or formula that can help here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. So, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved using the method for such recursions. The general form is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is known, and it's given by L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + (some term if there's an initial condition). Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a + r*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n >= 2, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut actually, since each layer is defined recursively, the formula approach is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods give me the same result, so I'm pretty sure that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a formula for the nth layer.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\n5. Verify the result using both iterative computation and the formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the recursive pattern and using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3\\), and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the expression.\n\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\), we derive the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n=9\\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made an error in computing Layer 9 or the multiplication.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and it's nested nine times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, nine layers, which I computed correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can write this as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same answer. So, either way, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I feel like this is a very large number, but given the number of layers, maybe it's correct. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for this.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without manually stepping through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut since the problem only had nine layers, even though it took a while, it was manageable step by step. However, knowing the general formula is helpful for future problems.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation, we found a closed-form solution, which allowed us to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, although in this case, since there were only nine layers, both methods worked.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to see that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If we expand this, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, but with some coefficients.\n\nWait, actually, let's think recursively. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing a few layers using the formula.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds, and thus the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've thought through this thoroughly, checked my work, and even found a more efficient way using recurrence relations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 11. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should write it out vertically: 29524 \u00d7 3 = ? Let's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\nThe next digit is 9 (from 29524), but wait, 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So starting from the right:\n4 \u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0.\nSo the result is 88572.

Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0.\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 + 2 =7 +1=8, write 8, carry 0.\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d73 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost, and each time, I just multiplied by 3 and added 1. It's a recursive-like process, but since it's a finite number of layers, it's manageable. I was a bit worried about keeping track of all the layers, but numbering them helped. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one step by step seems feasible. If it were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a geometric series, but here, nine isn't too bad. Let me just try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each layer is roughly multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for that. The general solution for such a recurrence is usually of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find that.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula instead of computing each layer step by step. That might be faster for larger numbers of layers, but for nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let's compute it step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 for the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer? Wait, no. Wait, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, so n=1 corresponds to the innermost. Then, Layer 2 is the next one, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I had to compute it without recognizing the pattern, I would have had to compute each layer step by step, which took a while but was manageable since there are only nine layers. But with the formula, it's much quicker. I think that's it.

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine sets of parentheses. So when I labeled them Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the innermost, that should be correct. So yes, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form x_{n} = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 4. So it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let me try to find the solution.\n\nThe recurrence is x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution x_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is x_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: x_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step and applying the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the formula**: The nth layer can be expressed as \\( x_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For n=9, \\( x_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is \"1 + 3\", then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\" So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(\" until we reach the outermost. Let me write them down:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, but the expression given is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n- The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\n- Layer3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n- ...\n- Up to Layer9: 1 + 3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 9 layers in total, each computed as above. So, if Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, Layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each term is built upon the previous one, so it's a linear recurrence, not a simple geometric series. But knowing that the closed-form solution exists as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, that's helpful. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as above. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me just verify with a smaller case to ensure my formula is correct. Suppose n=1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9=29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 72 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can evaluate it by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Now, adding 60000 + 28572: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct).

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside each other, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested pattern that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the number is 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake because when I did the multiplication, I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572 because 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3. Let me check with another method: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might make an error in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since the layers are repeating. It might save time and reduce the chance of errors. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), which gives c = 3c, leading to c=0. Then, finding a particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Then, A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^{n} + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 -1/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and solving it using the method above. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how a formula would save time for larger n.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each a_n is building a number in base 3. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I expand this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to n terms. Wait, but in our case, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Wait, but 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is similar to a geometric series, but not exactly. Let me check:\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get to a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_0, but since a_1=4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, that's 3^0 + 3^1. Then a_2=1 + 3*a_1 =1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +9 +3=13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 +3^3? Wait, no, 13 is 3^2 + 3 +1=9+3+1=13. Wait, but a_2=13=1 +3*4=1+12=13. Hmm, but 3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1+3+9=13. So, a_2=3^0 +3^1 +3^2=13. Similarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Which is 1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=40. So, indeed, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but a_1=4=1+3= sum_{k=0}^{1}3^k=1+3=4. a_2= sum_{k=0}^{2}3^k=1+3+9=13. a_3= sum_{k=0}^{3}3^k=1+3+9+27=40. So, in general, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Which is the same formula as before. So, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've verified it enough times using different methods, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then 1+3( ... So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, from the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3(...). Wait, let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is multiplied by a term that has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, the outermost term is Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. So, using the formula, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after working through each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using a recurrence relation, the value of each layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct each time. Maybe that's the right answer. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 step by step. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049. Correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution, confirming that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Hmm, that seems pretty large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution helped confirm the result without having to compute each layer step by step. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident now that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just compute 3 * 29,524 directly.

So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me find the particular solution. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Divide by 2: 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches the Layer9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that matches what I did before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing a_9 more quickly, but since n is only 9, computing each step is manageable. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. a_2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. a_3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then compute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's see: 3^{10} = 59049, so 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. But just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging into the equation: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=0, if we consider L_0, it would be 1 + 3*L_{-1}, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Hmm, maybe I can also approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Let\u2019s assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one step by step. Alternatively, this kind of expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Let me just verify each layer's computation again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88572. But I feel like that might be too large. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, and f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, let's compute f(1) to f(9):\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, f(9) = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite big, and I want to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. Let me check a couple of the layers again.\n\nFor example, Layer 5: f(5) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, f(9)=29524, and 3*f(9)=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the 9th layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, that seems like I might be missing a digit. Let me write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n5 \u00d73=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\nNow, since we've reached the leftmost digit, we write down the carryover if any. But here, after multiplying the 2 (the ten-thousands place), we get 6 +2=8, and no more digits left, so we're done.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 should be 88572, which is a 5-digit number.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7,7,7,8,2,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try a different approach. Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a way to represent this recursively or find a closed-form expression. The expression seems to be of the form: Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3, and then a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for just nine terms. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I expand it, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, after k steps, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} + 3^{k+1}*a_0, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, right? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recognize that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1, a_1=4. If I plug into (3^{n} - 1)/2: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the closed-form formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. That doesn't work. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form solution. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 =1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that all adds up. Alternatively, I could have used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=9, which gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing a couple of layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's recompute Layer 7: Layer 6 is 1093, so Layer 7 is 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as such. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression goes up to Layer 9, which is a_9, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. That's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation.
