    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9000 = 27000. 3 * 500 = 1500. 3 * 24 = 72. Adding them up: 27000 + 1500 = 28500; 28500 + 72 = 28572; 28572 + 60000 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. But wait, I thought 3*29524 might be 88572, but let me verify with another method. Maybe using the distributive property: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me see: Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So, each time, we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each time wrapping another 1 + 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: (1+3) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. Starting from the first 3, inside is 1+3(...). So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the innermost: (1+3) is Layer1. Then each time, moving outward, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3: Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1+3(...). Each time, the innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers? Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each time, wrapping another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it out with each layer:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3*\" occurs before the innermost (1+3).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3*\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Because starting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer1, then each time wrapping another layer up to Layer9, and then the outermost 3*(Layer9) would be Layer10. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3*\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nLooking at the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a 3, there's a \"(\", so let's count the number of \"(\" after each 3:\n\n1. 3*(...\n2. 3*(...\n3. 3*(...\n4. 3*(...\n5. 3*(...\n6. 3*(...\n7. 3*(...\n8. 3*(...\n9. 3*(...\n10. 3*(...\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer1. Then each time wrapping another layer, up to Layer9, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, the total number of layers is 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is separate. So, in my initial calculation, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any arithmetic errors in the steps. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula. Since the expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then:\n\nEntire expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524. Let me compute 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 524 = 1572. So, 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Then, adding that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to see if I made an error somewhere. Let's start over and compute each layer carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That seems correct.) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Right.) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Yes.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Yes.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Yes.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct.) Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that accurately. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each Layer n as L_n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but in our case, n is finite, so maybe we can express it differently. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try to unroll the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-2}\nSo, substituting back:\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\nContinuing this way, after k steps:\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} + 3^{k+1}*L_{n - k - 1}\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9, so the recurrence would unroll until L_1. So, L_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*L_0\n\nWait, but L_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let's check:\n\nIf n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. We know L_1=4, so 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => 3*L_0 = 3 => L_0=1.\n\nSo, using that, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_0\n\nSince L_0=1, then L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*1\n\nThe sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n - 1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 1)/2\n\nWait, let me verify that. Wait, if L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n, then sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2, so L_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. Let me check with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n=9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression in the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. So, according to my earlier analysis, the outermost 3 multiplies Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. That seems consistent.\n\nBut let me double-check my formula for L_n. I derived that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 manually:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the step-by-step computation leads me to the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I accounted for all nine layers. Therefore, multiplying by 3 at the end is correct. So, my calculation seems right. Let me just verify each step again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help solve these kinds of nested expressions more efficiently. Let me see if there's a formula or a recurrence relation here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is:\n\nL_n = (b / (a - 1)) * (a^{n} - 1)\n\nWait, let me make sure I recall this correctly. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is:\n\nL_n = a^{n-1} * L_1 + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nYes, that sounds right. Let me apply this formula to our case. Here, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. The number of layers is 9, so n = 9.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nL_9 = 3^{9-1} * 4 + 1*(3^{9-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_9 = 3^8 * 4 + (3^8 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561\n\nSo,\n\nL_9 = 6561 * 4 + (6561 - 1)/2\n\nCompute each part:\n\n6561 * 4: Let's compute 6561 * 4. 6000*4=24000, 500*4=2000, 60*4=240, 1*4=4. So, 24000 + 2000 = 26000, +240 = 26240, +4 = 26244.\n\n(6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280.\n\nSo, L_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. Therefore, using the recurrence relation formula, I also get L_9 = 29524, so the total expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. This confirms that my initial step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's a power of 3. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to nine terms, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Wait, actually, each layer adds another 3, so maybe it's a sum of 3^k for k from 1 to n, but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but that seems circular because the inner expression is similar to E itself. Hmm, maybe not the best approach here, since the expression is finite with nine layers, so it's not an infinite series. Therefore, using the recurrence relation or computing step by step is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods I've tried so far\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014have given me the same result, so I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out again. I think I've double-checked enough times. It's always good to verify, especially with so many layers, but I feel confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nOne last sanity check: Let me compute the value step by step using another method. Suppose I write the expression as E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I did before, but let me compute it in a table format for clarity.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nThen, E = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all my previous calculations. I think I've covered all bases here. I can't think of any other way to approach this problem, and all methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost and compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524 = 28572. Adding those together: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's breaking it down incorrectly because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, multiplying each part by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But I feel like such a large number might be unexpected. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it mathematically. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\nSimplify 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it once more without using the closed-form formula, just step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can safely say that the answer is 88572.\n\nI was a bit worried that the number was so large, but considering each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so the numbers get big quickly. It's similar to how compound interest works, where amounts can grow rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as a geometric series, each layer adds another factor of 3, so after 9 layers, it's 3^9 times the initial term, but since each layer also adds 1, it's not exactly a simple geometric series. However, the closed-form formula we derived earlier accurately captures the behavior.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, it's like building a tower where each level is three times the level below plus one. This kind of structure leads to exponential growth, which explains why the numbers get so large.\n\nI guess another thing I could check is whether my closed-form formula works for the earlier layers. Let's test it for n=1,2,3.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the initial layers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9.\n\nTherefore, I think I've solved the problem correctly, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer systematically. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 6, 8, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that would be 6 8 8 5 2, but that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 5 digits as well. Wait, no, 29524 is 5 digits, times 3, which is a single digit, so the result could be 5 or 6 digits. Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 5, 2, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I broke it down digit by digit, I thought I had 8, 7, 5, 2, 2, but that's not the case. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2\u00d73+2), 8 (from 9\u00d73+2), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you write the digits, you start from the right. So the correct way is:\n\nThe units digit: 2\n\nTens digit: 7\n\nHundreds digit: 5\n\nThousands digit: 8\n\nTen-thousands digit: 8\n\nSo, the number is 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3\u00d7L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3\u00d7L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A\u00d73^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3\u00d7C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A\u00d73^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7L_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer), and there are 9 such layers. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value, then worked outward, and finally multiplied by 3. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the result. Both methods led to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3. Using a closed-form solution from recognizing the recurrence relation, we confirm the result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let each layer be a term in a sequence, say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1 and the outermost layer 9, the outermost expression before multiplying by the initial 3 is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for 9 layers, either method works. I just need to remember that each layer can be represented by a geometric progression, which simplifies the computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula. \n\nUsing the closed-form formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the outermost layer (layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Hmm, but let me think again if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the innermost: (1+3(...)) and each time, we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears: 1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next layer: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost layer. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times (1+3(...)), and inside that, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, a new (1+3 starts. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with nine 1+3 terms? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each time adding another (1+3(...)). So, when I computed up to Layer9, that's correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me double-check the multiplication just to be safe. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again\u2014am I sure that each layer is correctly computed? Let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. Each step, when multiplied by 3 and added 1, gives the next layer. So, I think my computation is correct.

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524 = 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 524 = 1572. So, 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Then, adding that to 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me verify the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first 3 is outside Layer 9.\n- Then Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nSo that's 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time wrapping around the previous layer. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But I feel like that number is quite large. Let me check if my computation for each layer is correct.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nWait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nLayer 3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, the value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's see what 3^{11} is: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a formula for the nth layer as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but I'm getting 88572, but I think I might have made a mistake because when I did 3*29524, I thought of 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. Let's compute that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Then 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, etc. Let's plug into the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + B. For n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. For n=2: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But it's good to know that the formula exists for future problems. So, in summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I also verified the result using a general formula for the recurrence relation, which gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Because each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see a pattern here where each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is 1, so the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I have the right number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Each time I computed L_n, starting from L_1 as the innermost, so L_9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's like a sum where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut since it's finite (nine layers), it's more of a finite geometric series. But the formula I derived earlier seems to fit, so I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is 3^{n} * 1, but with the way the layers are built, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach since that worked.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n- Using the recurrence relation, we found that each layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n- For n = 9, that gives us 29524.\n\n- Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the calculations, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524. Wait, no, maybe I should just do 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have messed up the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me list them again: Layer 1: 1+3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly to confirm. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, but let me verify my calculations step by step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, all the layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the computed value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! So, the formula holds true for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. This alternative approach confirms the result I obtained earlier by direct computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula we derived is a closed-form expression for the nth term, which avoids the need for iterative computation. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a more efficient solution. But even if I didn't see that initially, computing each layer step by step still led me to the correct answer. So, both methods work, and it's reassuring that they agree. In summary, the problem required evaluating a deeply nested expression with repeated multiplications and additions. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and verifying each step, I arrived at the solution. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation provided a more elegant and quicker way to compute the result. This experience reminds me of the importance of looking for patterns and structures in mathematical problems, as they can often lead to more efficient solutions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, expanding step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, I can notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it that way to see if we can find a formula and avoid computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it, which confirms the result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, add that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the total is 88,572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error: 1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct, and I didn't notice any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I think that's the correct answer. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved using a formula. Let me recall that for such a recurrence, the solution is a geometric series. Specifically, since each term is a linear function of the previous term, we can solve it as follows: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term (the constant 1) is zero. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. So, using the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can lead to a direct formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step was manageable. However, it's good to know that the formula exists for future problems. So, to recap, by either method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, add that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.

So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me check the layers again because sometimes when I'm dealing with multiple layers, I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time adding another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so let's count them. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is one layer, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another. So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 1+3(...). How many layers is that? Let me count the number of 3's in the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each \"3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the outermost 3, each inner 3 adds a layer. Let's count: 3(1+3(...)) So, the first 3 is the outermost, then inside that is another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3's: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds a layer. Let me count the number of 3's after the initial 3: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n10. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers, but I only numbered up to Layer 9. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time nested. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. Then each time you go out, you add another 1+3(...). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me write them out:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times a big expression, which itself is 1 + 3 times another expression, and so on. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 this is the outermost, which is the first layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as each time I encounter a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the expression has 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, let me try to count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time you have 1+3(...), which is layer 2, then layer 3, etc., up to layer 9. So, that would mean that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost expression is layer 9. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have a similar expression with fewer layers, like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So, that works. Let me try another small example to verify.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother one: 3(1 + 3).\n\nThat's 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for smaller cases. Therefore, I can be confident that applying the same method to the larger problem will give the correct result.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just recompute 3*29524 to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I've broken down the problem step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, computing each layer carefully. I also verified my method with smaller examples to ensure that my approach was correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next.

Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so up to Layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.

Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3 * L_9, so that's 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Either way, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's breaking it down digit by digit. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's nine layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, recursively, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer, and then multiplied by 3.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct. So, the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can lead to a more straightforward computation without having to calculate each layer step by step. But in this case, since the number of layers isn't too large (nine layers), computing each step wasn't too bad. However, if there were, say, 20 layers, it would be impractical to compute each step manually, and the formula would be much more efficient. But for this problem, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it.

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but that seems quite large. Let me check my computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the innermost Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Let me verify each layer once more. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same result, which confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Sometimes when I'm multiplying large numbers, I might miscount or miscalculate. Let me recompute Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, 29524 * 3. 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I can approach this problem differently, using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and it's repeated multiple times, perhaps there's a geometric series or a recursive formula that can be applied here. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B.\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each a_n follows a geometric progression, we can see that each layer is essentially building up powers of 3, scaled appropriately.\n\nSo, I think I've verified it sufficiently.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) seems like it's a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous layer. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the initial step-by-step computation. Let me recompute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the formula approach, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 3*29524: Break it down as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. But 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression without computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers, which is a lot. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I know that for linear recurrences of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Let me apply that here. Here, k=3 and c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying the denominator: 1 - 3 = -2. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(-2))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(-2) = (4 + 0.5)*(3)^{n-1} - 0.5 = 4.5*(3)^{n-1} - 0.5. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = 4.5*(3)^{0} - 0.5 = 4.5*1 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 4.5*(3)^{1} - 0.5 = 4.5*3 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = 4.5*(3)^2 - 0.5 = 4.5*9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = 4.5*(3)^3 - 0.5 = 4.5*27 - 0.5 = 121.5 - 0.5 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = 4.5*(3)^8 - 0.5. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^8. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, 4.5*6561. Let me compute that. 4*6561 = 26244, 0.5*6561=3280.5. So, 26244 + 3280.5 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 0.5: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series or something else. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like each term is 1 + 3 times the sum of all previous terms. Wait, no, it's 1 + 3*(sum of the inner expression). Actually, it's a linear recurrence, which we've already modeled, so I think that's the right approach. Alternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, that looks like powers of 3. Let me see: 3^0=1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, etc. So, each layer adds another power of 3. So, for n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. But wait, in our case, each layer is multiplied by 3, so the expansion might be different. Let me think. If I have Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, it seems that each layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but for Layer 1, n=1, sum from k=0 to k=1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: sum from k=0 to k=2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: sum from k=0 to k=3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So, each layer n is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 up to 3^n. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula for Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost part of our original expression, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... + a*r^n can be expressed using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but this problem isn't exactly a sum; it's more of a recursive multiplication. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems solid. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer, using the formula for the recurrence relation. This gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm pretty sure that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, Layers 1 through 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial approach was correct.

So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. 29,524 *3: 29,524 * 2 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 +29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, then 3*29,524 is 88,572. But I'm just going to double-check each layer's computation because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression starts with 3*(...), so maybe I should consider that the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can be expressed using geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, for an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) with n layers, it can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check it for k=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works! So, the general formula for L_k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, k=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this using the formula approach. Since each L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the value of the innermost layer is computed step by step until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So when I compute Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, Layer 4 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 6 as 1093, Layer 7 as 3280, Layer 8 as 9841, and Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524. Let me compute 3 * 29524 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. So writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8.

Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I don't want to have made a multiplication error somewhere. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let's see if that applies here. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, so that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about it. The recursion here is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*(3)^n, and a particular solution would be a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*(3)^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*(3)^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, adding that to the earlier 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Hmm, wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.

Wait, maybe I should break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 6 8 5 8 2, which is 88582? Wait, that doesn't match what I had before. Wait, I think I messed up the breakdown. Let me do it properly:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 1500 + 72 = 1572. Now, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought I got 88582, but that was a mistake. Actually, it's 88572. So I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 88582. So, the correct result is 88572. Let me just confirm each step once more to be absolutely sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13. Next:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Then:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Then:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Then:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that the expression is finite and only has nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. However, if I were to generalize this, it might resemble a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its closed-form solution can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, since the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B, we can find B by setting n=0, but wait, n starts at 1. Alternatively, let's consider the steady-state solution. As n increases, the term A*3^n will dominate unless B cancels it out. But perhaps a better approach is to write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and solving it using the method above. But since the problem is finite and only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, using the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. In any case, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

But wait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(...)), so the outermost layer is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, I think my calculation is correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524 = 28572. So adding those together: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me double-check that multiplication. 3 * 9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, that seems quite large. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something because the number is so large. Let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach backs up the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Yes, correct. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 (Correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 (Correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524 (Correct). Then 3*29524=88572 (As before). So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we computed. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). But in this case, it's a first-order linear recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, to solve this, the homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I've got it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the 9th layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:** Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9524. Wait, 9524 is 9000 + 524. So, 3*9000 = 27000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Now, add that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, but hold on, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back step by step to verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, inside the first 3*(...), there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Let me try another approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try that again to double-check. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I've checked it enough times, and each method gives me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might be correct. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. To be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, and then multiplying the final result by 3, I arrive at the answer 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
