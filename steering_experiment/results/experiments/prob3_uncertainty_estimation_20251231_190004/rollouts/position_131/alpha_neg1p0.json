Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is tripling the previous layer plus one. So, it's like each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in this case, since it's nested, the recurrence approach works well. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, so after 9 layers, it's 3^9 times the initial 1 plus some sum of powers of 3. But that might complicate things more. I think the step-by-step computation is straightforward here, especially since there are only 9 layers. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to 29524. Then, multiply that by 3 to get 88572. Yes, that seems correct.

Using the formula: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, then 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, for three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait.
