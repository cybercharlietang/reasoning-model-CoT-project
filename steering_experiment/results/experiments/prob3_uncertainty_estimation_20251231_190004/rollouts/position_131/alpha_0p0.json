So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), for some constant c. Let me try to find c such that this holds. Expanding: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c But from the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c Subtract 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Let me define b_n = a_n + 1/2. Then, the recurrence becomes b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a simple geometric progression with ratio 3. The initial term b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. For n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Compute 3^8: 3^8 = 6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Again, same result.
