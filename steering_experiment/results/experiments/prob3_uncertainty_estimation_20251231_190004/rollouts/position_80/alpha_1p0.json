Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. But just to make sure, let me compute L_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. 3^{10}=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it much faster and reduced the chance of error.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then inside, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count: 1. 1 + 3(...) [innermost]\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...) [outermost]\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9. So, the computation I did earlier is correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can model this with a formula. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the nonhomogeneous term is the constant 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct, same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, recognizing that each a_n is a term in a geometric sequence. Since a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, which is similar to the form of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, it's a recurrence relation. Anyway, I think I've confirmed it in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.

Wait, but I feel like the numbers are getting big quickly, so maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = b^{n} * (L_0) + a*(b^{n} -1)/(b -1). Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to make sure. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, which is 4, as we saw. The outermost layer is Layer 9: n=9. So Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11=177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - c/(1 - r). Wait, let me make sure. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, indeed, each term is growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the multiplicative factor of 3 each time. To find a closed-form solution, let's consider the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, compute a_4 using the formula: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, but each time it's wrapped in another \"1+3(...)\" So, actually, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each time you go out, you have another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3(, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers.

So, Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the final expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, it's 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for each layer. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L(n), which would make computing the layers faster, especially if there are many layers. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). So L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check the multiplication once more to be sure. 29524 *3: 29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So I think I've solved it correctly by breaking it down step by step and verifying each layer. It's a bit tedious, but working from the inside out and using the recurrence relation helped a lot. I also checked my work by computing each layer and then using the general formula, which gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_2=1 +3*4=13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check the computations once more to be sure. 3^10 is 59049, correct. 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Maybe I miscounted the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So let's list them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} / (r - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1}. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for such a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So actually, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first \"(\", each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, but the last one is 1+3), so maybe it's 8 layers? Let me check. Let me write the expression with numbers:\n\nLayer 9: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So my earlier computation seems correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = B*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = B*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = B*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it as a geometric series, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Maybe another way to look at it is recognizing that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, to verify. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients, we can solve it more straightforwardly. The general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently. I don't see any mistakes in the steps now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a_n = C is a constant solution. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A=4.5 => A=1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, that's (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or formula for L_n in terms of n.\n\nLet me see:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Using the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set this equal to the left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2}-3)/2. So for n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Multiplying the outermost 3 by this result gives:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set b_n = a_n + c, so that b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. That's a geometric sequence with ratio 3, so b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n - c = (b_1)*3^{n-1} - c. Now, let's find c. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c. But we want a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). So, 3*(a_{n-1} + c) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Therefore, 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Comparing both sides, 1 + c = 3c. So, 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. So, a_n = b_n - 1/2, where b_n = (a_1 + 1/2)*3^{n-1}. Since a_1 = 4, then b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Thus, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me consider how many terms there are. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers. So the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each step is 1 + 3*previous. So maybe it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, since there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCompute a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

Starting from the inside, computing each layer step by step, and then verifying with a general formula. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or something, instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form expression for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's try to solve this recursion. The recursion is linear and can be written as: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4. So: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, right? Let me confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, this seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is based on the characteristic equation r = 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. If I expand all the layers, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} plus some terms. Wait, actually, let me think about it. Each a_n can be written as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's try expanding a_1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Which is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n}. The sum of this series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the closed-form we found earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

Then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The recursive formula is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: f(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's find f(2): f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. Using the general solution: f(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: f(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Wait, because (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^k. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me denote the innermost term as f(1)=1+3=4=3^1 +1. Then f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 + 3 +1=9+3+1=13. Similarly, f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40=3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1=27+9+3+1=40. Wait, so f(n)=3^n + 3^(n-1)+...+3^1 +1. Which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Wait, but in our case, f(n)= sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Which matches our earlier formula. So, for n=9 layers, f(9)= (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 +3*previous, and we have nine layers, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*((3^10 -1)/2)= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that matches. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the geometric series sum formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the value after nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) If there are n layers, then E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with n-1 layers. But in our case, n=9, because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the given problem, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 more layers. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, with a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve it: The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Then, find a particular solution. Assume the particular solution is a constant B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for a geometric series. Since each a_n is built from multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=13=4*3 +1, a_3=13*3 +1=40, etc. So, the nth term can be expressed as a_n = 3^{n} * a_1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since we've already derived a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, that's sufficient. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

This looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4=13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2=1 +3*13=40. Hmm, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1=4, each subsequent L_n is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This kind of recursion can be solved to find a closed-form expression, perhaps. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because each step checks out, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation aligns with the manual computations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, which matches what I did earlier. So, each term is defined by a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. Then, the problem has 9 layers, so n=9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps better to write it as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. Wait, no, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 *3: 29524\nx     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. By evaluating each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the final answer is 3*a9=88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a3=(3^4/2)-1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step, perhaps using a different approach or formula. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using a formula, especially if they are finite. Let me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x'. Then x' = 1 + 3x''. But in this case, it's a finite number of layers, so it's a finite recursion. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series or something similar. Wait, let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} can be found. Let's see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). Let me see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, but this is exactly what I did before. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 =29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times... Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original problem has nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency. a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = 40. Correct. a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = 121. Correct. a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = 728/2=364. Correct. a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = 2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = 6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct. So, yes, the formula is consistent with each layer's manual computation. Therefore, the final step is multiplying a_9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but actually, our first term is a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. So perhaps it's better to model it as a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n >=2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, for n=2: a_2=1 +3*4=13, which matches. For n=3: 1 +3*13=40, etc. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

    "text": " Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. Each layer is building up exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to rapid growth. Using the closed-form formula helps confirm that the step-by-step computation was correct. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
