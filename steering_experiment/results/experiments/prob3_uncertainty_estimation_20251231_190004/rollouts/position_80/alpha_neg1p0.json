Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So both methods give me the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I was able to find the value at each level until I reached the outermost layer, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form formula, which also led me to the same answer. It's reassuring that both methods agree, so I can be pretty sure that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so expanding it all the way, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let the innermost be x, then x=1+3, then the next layer is 1 +3x, and so on. But since we have a fixed number of layers, it's easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, it's straightforward. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. The homogeneous part is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting that the layers follow a geometric progression, so the formula allows us to compute the nth layer directly. I think I've got the correct answer here. Just to be thorough, let me check my multiplication again: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me try that. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern: L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, solving the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression would be 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a geometric sequence perhaps? Let's see. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we go up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that directly: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation to find a formula, which made the computation much easier than manually computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. It's interesting how recognizing the structure of the problem can simplify the solution process. I guess practice helps in noticing these patterns more quickly. Anyway, I think I'm satisfied with this solution. It makes sense, and I've verified it using two different methods: step-by-step computation and applying a formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2, up to a_9. So, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. For n=2, a_2=13 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's verify this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9= L_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since each Layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. That might have been a faster method, but since I was just starting out, I did each layer manually, which is more straightforward for a beginner. Either way, the answer is 88572.

Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of layer n. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 =4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did initially, and it also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is the same. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since there are only 9 layers. Alternatively, I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer.

It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.

As we've solved, the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each one is feasible. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed it directly without computing each layer. But since the number of layers was manageable, either approach works. In any case, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 1 + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. So, D -3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. a_1=4. So, 4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, both methods give me 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and finally multiply the outermost result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. It can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is:\n   - a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: Since there are 9 layers, compute a_9:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find the closed-form solution, I end up with the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make the computation faster or confirm my answer. Let me see: Each layer seems to follow the pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression, it's 3*(a_9), where a_9 = 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each layer is defined recursively, using the recurrence relation was a good approach. Another way to see it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a linear recurrence, and we solved it using standard techniques.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see: The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. In general, for such a nested expression with n layers, the value can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test it with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches Layer 1: 1+3=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2:13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3:40. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, the value would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which is exactly what I got when I computed Layer 9 step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572, as before. So using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I computed earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric series but with a multiplier each time. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

But perhaps recognizing the pattern would help. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, layer 1 corresponds to n=1, which gives a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.

Starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88572.

This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see: The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so the homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the start, after the first 3, there are 9 layers. Wait, no, each time it's 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is 9? Wait, let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each next is 1 + 3(layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, 1 + 3 is layer 1. Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3(layer). So, the layers are as follows: Layer1: 1 + 3 =4 Layer2:1 +3*4=13 Layer3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I can find a pattern or a formula, maybe I can compute it without going through each layer. Let me think about it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our expression has 9 layers, so a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series but with an added 1 each time. But since I found the formula, it's easier to compute directly. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without so many steps. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the same as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's finite, with 9 layers, maybe I can express it as a sum. Wait, but actually, it's a finite nested multiplication, so perhaps using the formula for a finite geometric series would help. The formula for a finite geometric series is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me think if I can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost term as S_1 =1 +3. Then S_2=1 +3*S_1, S_3=1 +3*S_2, and so on up to S_9. Then the entire expression is 3*S_9. From earlier, I found that S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as before. Then 3*S_9=88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me see if I can express this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost as E_1=1 +3. Then E_2=1 +3*E_1=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13. E_3=1 +3*E_2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40. E_4=1 +3*40=121. E_5=1 +3*121=364. E_6=1 +3*364=1093. E_7=1 +3*1093=3280. E_8=1 +3*3280=9841. E_9=1 +3*9841=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute E_n without computing each layer. Since each E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, with E_1=4, as before. So, using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation, which I did earlier, gives E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then 3*E_9=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand the expression:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me expand the innermost parentheses first:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext: 1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext: 1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext: 1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext: 1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext: 1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext: 1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext: 1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to express E_n in terms of a sum. From the recurrence relation E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, we can write E_n -3*E_{n-1}=1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution, as I found earlier, is E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, E_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*E_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it by recognizing that each layer is adding another power of 3. Let me think about that. Each time we have 1 +3*(...), which is similar to 1 +3*previous layer. So, expanding the entire expression, we can write it as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but perhaps more systematically.

But perhaps it's better to use the method I did earlier, computing each layer step by step. So, as before, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as a sum:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers.\n\nExpanding, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to expand it:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first, which is (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen moving out, each layer is 1 +3*previous result.\n\nSo, as before, it's the same as computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see that each layer is contributing a term of 3^k, but I need to think carefully about how that works.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4\n\nLayer 2:13=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13\n\nLayer 3:40=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40\n\nLayer 4:121=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=121\n\nLayer 5:364=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=364\n\nLayer 6:1093=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=1093\n\nLayer 7:3280=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=3280\n\nLayer 8:9841=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=9841\n\nLayer 9:29524=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=29524\n\nSo, each layer n corresponds to (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

Let me check that.\n\nIf E=3*(3^{10} -1)/2, then E= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster or provide a better understanding. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1) + a_0, but in this case, the initial term is a_1=4, and each subsequent term is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, let's see if we can model this as a geometric series. Let me write down the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 12) = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\nWait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recognize that each layer is building a geometric progression. Let me try to express Layer n in terms of the previous layers.\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 9, each layer is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, in general, each layer can be written as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWhich is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach to solve such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But for 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nIn summary, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find a general formula to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which saves time and reduces the chance of errors.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9, so the expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to go through each layer step by step. That's a good check because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make an arithmetic error, but with the formula, it's more straightforward. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a geometric series. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which leads to a general solution a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, it's more of a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation. We can solve this recurrence to find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. So, substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. It's reassuring that both approaches give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be computed using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{10} is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form solution for this recurrence, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 9) is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4, as we saw. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the terms: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L1 is just 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Wait, but actually, L1 is 4, L2 is 13, L3 is 40, etc. So, perhaps this is a geometric sequence or something else. Let me try to find a formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, but this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the solution Ln = C*3^(n). For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Because n=9, so (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^(10)-1)/2= (3^(11)-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I feel good about this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 29524*3=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the closed-form is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then times 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and finding the closed-form expression. But either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."
