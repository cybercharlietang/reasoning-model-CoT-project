Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Alternatively, I could compute it using the formula: Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147.

So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Calculating each layer step by step gives me the value at each layer, and after 9 layers, I get 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation approach, I derived a formula that gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. So I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's verify this with our earlier computations.

So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Now, compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that's the same answer I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I had more layers, this formula would be very useful, but since there are only 9 layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form expression from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression.
