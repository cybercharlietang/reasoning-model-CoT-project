In this case, the recurrence relation approach was helpful. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. For example, starting from the innermost layer: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Hmm, so each a_n seems to be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Let me check: For a_1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4. For a_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13. For a_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is consistent with the earlier closed-form expression. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, all methods converge to the same result. It's always good to cross-verify using different approaches to ensure the answer is correct. In summary, by computing each layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, and applying the formula for a geometric series, I arrived at the same final answer each time. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
