    "text": " Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: Total = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nTotal: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That sounds like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The expression can be represented as a sum: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But since we've already derived a formula for a_n, and confirmed it with both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I feel confident that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, I can compute 3^{10} again: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\nSo, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods led to the same answer, so I'm pretty confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

    "text": " Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total is 88,572. But wait a second, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each time I move out, it's another layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). The expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is (1+3*(Layer 1)), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is29524. Multiply by 3:29524*3=88,572. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) follows \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer builds up until the outermost layer (n=9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do this step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I compute step by step, especially with large numbers, I might miscalculate somewhere. Let me verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula because each layer is defined in terms of the previous one. Let's see, the recursive formula seems to be Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for this. Let's see, the general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to this kind of recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assume a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For Layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about that. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, and 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. To recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step or using the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\), we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this gives \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer. So, either by computing each layer step by step or by finding a formula for the layers, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, 7, no carryover.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. So, 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. So, 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made an error in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which gave me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me see if I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that's applicable here.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps each layer can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is built by 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence, so maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series isn't directly applicable, but the recurrence solution worked fine.\n\nIn any case, both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the formula derived from the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times \\) Layer 9, which is \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\):\n\\[ 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). I computed each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9), each time substituting the previous layer's result. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which gave me 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each step was straightforward, just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, but since each term is dependent on the previous one, it's more like repeated multiplication and addition.

Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.

Well, 29524 * 3 is the same as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Now, the total expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute it as 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; +1,500 = 88,500; +60 = 88,560; +12 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So the total is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me check each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 13, correct. Layer 3: 40, correct. Layer 4: 121, correct. Layer 5: 364, correct. Layer 6: 1093, correct. Layer 7: 3280, correct. Layer 8: 9841, correct. Layer 9: 29524, correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me try another approach to verify, maybe using a different method, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a nested multiplication, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which resembles a geometric progression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. But wait, in this case, the expression is finite, with nine layers. So, maybe I can express it recursively. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. So that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, and each layer adds another a_n until we reach a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

I think I did this right. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a geometric progression. Let's define a recursive formula where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 (correct)\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\nn=5: a5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 (correct)\nn=6: a6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 (correct)\nn=7: a7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 (correct)\nn=8: a8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 (correct)\nn=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 (correct)\n\nPerfect! So the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 correctly gives the value of each layer. So for Layer 9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled by a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a formula for each layer, which leads to the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, we compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the total should be 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the numbers from top: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, let me check if I labeled the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, I think my approach is correct because each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, nine layers in total. Wait, but when I counted, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous), so that would be nine layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for it. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. Let me denote the innermost as a1 = 1 + 3. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then the total expression is 3*a9. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, computing each a_i step by step is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n where n is the number of layers. Let's see, if I have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). But in this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a first-order linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost in the layers, so I should verify each step. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer's result is correct when checked step by step. So, I think my answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. It seems like each term is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall how to solve such recursions. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3*B = 1\n\n-2*B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, using this formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so:\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I'm done then. The final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. The recurrence relation for each layer is:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, let's compute that: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)))). It's a nested expression with n layers, where n is 9 in this case because I see nine sets of parentheses. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let me write down the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative layer-by-layer computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote the innermost term as S. So, S = 1 + 3. Then, the next term is 1 + 3*S. Then, the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S), and so on. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is the same as the recurrence relation we saw earlier. But perhaps if I expand the entire expression, I can see a pattern. Let's try expanding a few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Let me denote E as the entire expression. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute this step by step, layer by layer, as before, but perhaps I can see a pattern in the exponents of 3. Let me note that each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 4\nWait, 3^2 is 9, and 9 + 4 is 13. Hmm, maybe not the most helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 81 -1 = 80/2 = 40.\n\nYes, so the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nYes, because 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nNow, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an additional 1 added each time. However, since the 1 is added before multiplying by 3, it's a bit different from a standard geometric series. But the recurrence relation approach worked well here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a sum of a geometric series with each term being 3^k, but I think that might complicate things more. The step-by-step approach seems straightforward and reliable.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the calculations, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me do that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\nFinal result: 3*29524=88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the numbers make sense. Let me just confirm the multiplication at the end: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times I computed a layer. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time I went one layer out. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so that's correct. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, except for the very first step which was just 1+3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a recursive sequence. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did before. So, up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. So, the approach is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve the equation by assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 / 2) - (1/2) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm that my initial computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand it all the way, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but actually, each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3, so it's not exactly a geometric series but more like a nested multiplication.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let me take a smaller version of the problem to test this idea. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, if I expand the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Now, let's see if this can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. The expression 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is the value before the outermost multiplication by 3. So, in this case, the innermost expression evaluates to 4, which is 3 + 1. Then, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the general form is that each layer adds 3^n, starting from n=0 up to n=k, where k is the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the smaller example with three layers, we had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. And 40 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, which is the sum from n=0 to n=3 of 3^n. So, 3*(sum from n=0 to n=3 of 3^n) = 3*(40) = 120. Wait, but in our original problem, we have nine layers. So, perhaps the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4, which is 3^1 + 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3^1 +1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3^2 + 3 +1) = 1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3. Wait, so each layer adds another power of 3. So, after k layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k}. Therefore, in the smaller example with three layers, the innermost expression is after 1 layer: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Then, the next layer adds 3^2, so 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13. The next layer adds 3^3, so 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3) = 3*40 = 120. So, in general, for n layers, the expression inside would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, in our original problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count: Starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(...). The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside each parenthesis, there are eight more layers. Wait, no, let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each next layer wraps around that. So, in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then (1 + 3*(...)), and so on, up to nine layers. Wait, let me count: The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nSo, that's nine layers. Therefore, n=9 in the formula. So, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the result I got earlier. So, this is another way to confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, so the sum is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, in this case, n=9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers corresponds correctly. If I have nine layers, does that mean the sum goes up to 3^9? Or is it up to 3^8? Let me think about the smaller example again. In the smaller example with three layers, the sum inside was up to 3^3, which is 27, and then multiplied by 3 to get 120. So, if I have n layers, the sum inside is up to 3^n, and then multiplied by 3, giving 3*(sum up to 3^n) = 3*( (3^{n+1} -1)/2 ). So, for nine layers, it's 3*(sum up to 3^9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as a base-3 number or something, but I think the geometric series approach is more straightforward.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, yes, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression using exponentiation by squaring or some other method, but I think the step-by-step expansion and the geometric series approach have both confirmed that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost outwards, got each result, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. Then, I checked it using the geometric series formula, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let's do this multiplication step by step. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163. Write down 3 and carry over 16. 95 * 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301. Write down 1 and carry over 30. 29 * 3 = 87, plus 30 is 117. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try a different approach. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1.

But in my initial calculation, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*3,280 is 9,840, which is correct, so Layer 8 is 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841.

Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\n364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then 1 + 1,092=1,093.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, the final step is: Final result: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3.

Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. 29,524 is the same as 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20,000 = 60,000; 3*9,000 = 27,000; 3*500 = 1,500; 3*20 = 60; 3*4 = 12.

But wait, let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because if one layer is wrong, the subsequent layers will be off.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9, which is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, the problem is to compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59,049. Then, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572. So, everything checks out. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some time. But either way, I arrived at the same answer. Just to make sure, I'll compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, more concisely. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, after verifying each step and even finding a closed-form formula to confirm, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Each step checks out, so I think I did this right. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall how to solve linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f That's correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, Layer 9, which is a9, is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct).

Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, which is the innermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc., up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation here. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the first order. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. To recap, I recognized the pattern as a linear recurrence, found the general formula, verified it with the initial terms, and then applied it to find the value at n=9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but using the formula was more efficient and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Okay, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, n=9, which gives a_9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed with a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of each layer as a term in a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me try to model that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the sequence is: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches what I got earlier. Alternatively, I could try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each term is defined by a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the recurrence relation with a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of operations. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this using a closed-form formula confirms the result.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive expression. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the closed-form approach also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we confirm that the ninth layer (a_9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
