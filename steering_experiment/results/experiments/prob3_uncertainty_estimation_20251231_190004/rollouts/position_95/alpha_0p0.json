Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Similarly, for n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, we can solve it as follows: Let's write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, indeed, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, to solve this recurrence relation, we can express a_n in terms of a_1. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, but it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me make sure. Let me solve the recurrence relation. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which leads to a geometric progression, so using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually was feasible. It's also a good way to verify the formula, by computing a few terms and seeing if they fit the pattern. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed earlier. Now, the general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for 9 terms, computing each is faster. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant A. Then substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed the pattern in the layers: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, so each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each next term is 1 + 3*(previous). As I computed earlier, each layer's value is as follows: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, let's adjust the indices. If I consider a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} + (something). Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

But just for fun, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers starting from a_1. Wait, let me confirm. If a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then a_1 = 4, which is correct. Then a_2 is the next layer, and so on up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.
