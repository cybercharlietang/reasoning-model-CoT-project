The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the first few terms and see a pattern. We have: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Hmm, so it seems like a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(a_9), and since a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But since I already have the closed-form, I can use that to compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is helpful for longer expressions. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each innermost term is 1 + 3, and each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I was able to reach the outermost layer, which was 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.

The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the nth term to compute a_9 directly, which would have saved time, but since the number of layers is manageable, computing each step is feasible.

Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, which we derived as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, we can compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. Either way, the answer comes out the same.

In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Wait, no, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. Here, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, indeed, k=3, c=1. The initial condition would be a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 3*13 +1 = 40, which also matches. So, using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence: a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4. So, perhaps we need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, let me index the layers starting from a_0. Let me define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. Then, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n+1} + (1/2)(3^{n} - 1). Wait, perhaps I should derive it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying: a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. Alternatively, factoring out 3^{n}: a_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: 9/2 *3^n = (9*3^n)/2 = (3^{2}*3^n)/2 = 3^{n+2}/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=0: a_0 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=1: a_1 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9? Wait, no, let's see. Wait, in our earlier step-by-step, Layer 1 was a_1 =4, Layer 2 was a_2=13, up to Layer 9 being a_9=29524. So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to Layer n, which is a_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{11} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -1 =177146. Divided by 2: 177146/2=88573. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, Layer 9 was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{11}-1)/2=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*88573=265719. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier result. There must be a mistake here. Wait, let's clarify the indexing. Earlier, I considered Layer 1 as a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1 in the formula. So, if we have 9 layers, then n=9 in the formula would be Layer 9. But according to the formula, a_9=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*88573=265719. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, and 3*29524=88572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? Let me check my step-by-step computation again. Starting from Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. So, according to this, the final answer is 88572. But according to the formula, a_9=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and then 3*a_9=265719. Clearly, there's a conflict. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula approach. Let me see. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me re-examine the recurrence. The recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1+3=4. Wait, no, actually, in the formula, a_n is defined as a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4. So, a_1=1 +3*a_0=1+12=13, as before. Then, the general solution is a_n=(3^{n+2}-1)/2. So, a_0=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, correct. a_1=(3^{3}-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. a_2=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{11}-1)/2=177146/2=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*88573=265719. But in the step-by-step, I got 88572. So, which is correct? There must be a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the step-by-step again. Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9=88573, then 3*a_9=265719. These are two different results. Therefore, one of them must be wrong. Let me see. Perhaps the formula is for the number of terms, but I'm misapplying it. Wait, in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. But in the formula, a_n=(3^{n+2}-1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{11}-1)/2=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=265719. But in the step-by-step, I got 88572. Therefore, perhaps the step-by-step is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3: that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3)))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers. Therefore, n=9. So, according to the formula, a_9=88573, then 3*a_9=265719. But in the step-by-step, I got 88572. So, which is correct? Let me check the step-by-step again. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me compute each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, it's 265719. There's a conflict here. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not applicable here, or I made a mistake in setting it up. Alternatively, perhaps the formula gives the value of a_9, which is the innermost expression before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which according to the formula is 3*(88573)=265719. But according to the step-by-step, it's 3*29524=88572. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Let me see. If I index the layers starting from 0, then a_0=4, a_1=13, a_2=40, etc., up to a_8=29524. Because there are 9 layers, from a_0 to a_8. So, if n=8, then a_8=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Yes, that matches the step-by-step result. Therefore, a_8=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572. So, the confusion was in the indexing. The formula uses n starting from 0, so for 9 layers, n=8. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was correct, and the formula approach had an off-by-one error in indexing. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let me compute a_8 using the formula: a_8=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, resulting in the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nMultiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

So yes, that's what I did earlier. Now, the general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.

Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.

So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, that's the correct answer. Alternatively, using the general formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the general formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it more generally. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. So, using the formula, we also get 88572. That's reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Expanding each layer, it's like 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*something, so when you expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which when expanded would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check that. Suppose I have Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 And so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Therefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, in this case, r=3, n=9. Therefore, sum = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is the same as a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this sum, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the nested expression as a geometric series. That's a nice shortcut, but since I initially approached it step by step, it's good to see both methods lead to the same answer. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the geometric series approach give the same result. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute this. First, a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc. So, maybe the index starts at 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula. Let me think: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.

Wait, no, in our case, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So yes, r = 3, d = 1. So the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So maybe we can adjust the indices. Let me think. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1. So the general solution is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2. So a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3, leading to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations.

Wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw earlier. Let me write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as we had before. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Wait, but in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3 and c=1. Let me check: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, applying the formula: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer adds another power of 3. But in this case, since it's nested, the formula approach seems more efficient. Either way, I arrive at the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is fine. For constants: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Wait, let's check. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = k^n * C, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = k*A + c. Solving for A: A - k*A = c => A*(1 - k) = c => A = c/(1 - k). So the general solution is a_n = k^n * C + c/(1 - k). Now, applying initial conditions. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So perhaps a_0 = 1? Let me see. Wait, actually, our layers start at a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So perhaps n starts at 1. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So let's write the general solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, which is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
