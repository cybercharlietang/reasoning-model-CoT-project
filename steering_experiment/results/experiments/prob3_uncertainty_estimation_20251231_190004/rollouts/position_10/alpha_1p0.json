    "text": " Hmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). Maybe if I evaluate the innermost part first, I can work my way outwards. Let me count how many nested expressions there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. Let me count the number of 3s. Wait, maybe it's better to just start evaluating step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*(4) = 12. Then, the next layer is (1 + 12). Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me make sure I'm tracking correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step systematically. Let me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is L9. So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the multiplication steps. Maybe I should compute 3*29524 directly.\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me retrace my steps. Each layer was calculated correctly, right?\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 13\n\nL3: 40\n\nL4: 121\n\nL5: 364\n\nL6: 1093\n\nL7: 3280\n\nL8: 9841\n\nL9: 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, multiplying the outermost 3 by L9 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with the result of the inner layer and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times another expression. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with 1 + 3*(previous). So how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Because each \"1+3\" is a layer, and there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times the 3 is multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)): 1. 3(1 + 3(...) 2. 3(1 + 3(...) 3. 3(1 + 3(...) 4. 3(1 + 3(...) 5. 3(1 + 3(...) 6. 3(1 + 3(...) 7. 3(1 + 3(...) 8. 3(1 + 3(...) 9. 3(1 + 3(...)) So, actually, there are 9 layers of 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)), but the innermost one is just 1+3, so maybe there are 8 layers? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's define each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2. And so on, up to E_9, which would be the innermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E_8), because each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me clarify. The innermost expression is E_1 = 1 + 3. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1. Then E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, until E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8. Then the entire expression is 3*E_9. So, if I compute E_1 through E_9, each time substituting the previous value, I can find the total. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which would be time-consuming, especially since there are 9 layers. Let me try to compute the first few layers to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with E_1:\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, total = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at E_n, each time we have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can derive it here.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually, but having a formula is helpful for larger n.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo, expanding E_n:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, after n steps, we get:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_1\n\nBut E_1 =4, which is 1 +3, so actually, E_1 = 1 +3, which is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express E_n as a sum.\n\nWait, from the recurrence E_n =1 +3E_{n-1}, with E_1=4.\n\nThis can be rewritten as E_n -3E_{n-1}=1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nBut another way to think about it is that each E_n is a sum of 3^{k} terms.\n\nWait, let's try to unroll the recurrence:\n\nE_n =1 +3E_{n-1}\n\nE_{n-1}=1 +3E_{n-2}\n\nSo, E_n=1 +3(1 +3E_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2 E_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, E_{n-2}=1 +3E_{n-3}\n\nSo, E_n=1 +3 +3^2(1 +3E_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 E_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this way, after n steps, we get:\n\nE_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n-1} +3^n E_1\n\nSince E_1=4=1 +3, which is 1 +3^1.\n\nSo, E_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * (1 +3)\n\nWait, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so it's (3^n -1)/(3 -1)= (3^n -1)/2.\n\nThen, E_n= (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n*(1 +3)= (3^n -1)/2 +4*3^n.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nE_n= (3^n -1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2= (3^n -1 +8*3^n)/2= (9*3^n -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier we had E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nFrom the unrolling:\n\nE_n=1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n-1} +3^n * E_1\n\nBut E_1=4=1 +3, so substituting:\n\nE_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n*(1 +3)= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n +3^{n+1}\n\nNow, sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k = (3^n -1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n=(3^n -1)/2 +3^n +3^{n+1}\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, express all terms with denominator 2:\n\n(3^n -1)/2 + (2*3^n)/2 + (2*3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo, E_n= [3^n -1 +2*3^n +2*3^{n+1}]/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3^n +2*3^n=3*3^n=3^{n+1}\n\nSo, numerator becomes: 3^{n+1} -1 +2*3^{n+1}=3^{n+1} +2*3^{n+1} -1=3*3^{n+1} -1=3^{n+2} -1\n\nThus, E_n=(3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, using the recurrence, we had E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's test with n=1.\n\nFrom the formula E_n=(3^{n+2} -1)/2, when n=1: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. But E_1=4, not 13. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unrolling. Let's try again.\n\nE_n =1 +3E_{n-1}\n\nUnrolling:\n\nE_n=1 +3(1 +3E_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2 E_{n-2}\n\nE_{n-2}=1 +3E_{n-3}\n\nSo, E_n=1 +3 +3^2(1 +3E_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 E_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this until we reach E_1.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9 E_1\n\nE_1=4=1 +3\n\nSo, E_9= sum_{k=0}^8 3^k +3^9*(1 +3)= sum_{k=0}^8 3^k +3^9 +3^{10}\n\nSum_{k=0}^8 3^k= (3^9 -1)/2\n\nSo, E_9= (3^9 -1)/2 +3^9 +3^{10}\n\nConvert all terms to have denominator 2:\n\n(3^9 -1)/2 + (2*3^9)/2 + (2*3^{10})/2\n\nCombine numerator:\n\n3^9 -1 +2*3^9 +2*3^{10}= (1 +2)3^9 +2*3^{10} -1=3^{10} +2*3^{10} -1=3*3^{10} -1=3^{11} -1\n\nThus, E_9= (3^{11} -1)/2\n\nWait, but earlier we had E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, E_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. But according to this, E_9=(3^{11} -1)/2. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute E_9 both ways.\n\nFrom the initial calculation, E_9=29524.\n\nCompute (3^{10} -1)/2: 3^10=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nFrom the other approach, E_9=(3^{11} -1)/2=177147 -1=177146/2=88573. Which is different.\n\nSo, the first formula is correct, E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the unrolling? Let me check.\n\nWhen I unrolled E_n, I ended up with E_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n*E_1\n\nBut E_1=4=1 +3.\n\nSo, substituting, E_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n*(1 +3)= sum +3^n +3^{n+1}\n\nSum is (3^n -1)/2\n\nThus, E_n= (3^n -1)/2 +3^n +3^{n+1}= (3^n -1 +2*3^n +2*3^{n+1})/2= (3^n +2*3^n +2*3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3*3^n +2*3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+1} +2*3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3*3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nBut this contradicts our earlier correct formula. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the unrolling process.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms is off. Let's think again.\n\nWhen unrolling E_n, each step adds a term and multiplies by 3, so the number of terms in the sum is n, not n-1.\n\nWait, let's try n=1: E_1=4.\n\nUsing the formula E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=1: (9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nIf I use the unrolled sum:\n\nE_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n*E_1\n\nWait, for n=1: sum_{k=0}^{0}3^k=1, and 3^1*E_1=3*4=12. So E_1=1 +12=13, which is incorrect because E_1=4. So, the unrolling approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the unrolling. Let me try to unroll correctly.\n\nE_n=1 +3E_{n-1}\n\nE_{n-1}=1 +3E_{n-2}\n\nSo, E_n=1 +3*(1 +3E_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2 E_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, E_{n-2}=1 +3E_{n-3}\n\nSo, E_n=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3E_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 E_{n-3}\n\nContinuing until E_1.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9*E_1\n\nBut E_1=4=1 +3.\n\nSo, E_9= sum_{k=0}^8 3^k +3^9*(1 +3)= sum +3^9 +3^{10}\n\nSum is (3^9 -1)/2\n\nThus, E_9=(3^9 -1)/2 +3^9 +3^{10}= (3^9 -1 +2*3^9 +2*3^{10})/2= (3^9 +2*3^9 +2*3^{10} -1)/2= (3*3^9 +2*3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{10} +2*3^{10} -1)/2= (3*3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nBut wait, we know that E_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nBut according to this, E_9=(3^{11} -1)/2= (177147 -1)/2=88573, which is different. So, there must be a mistake in the unrolling process.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that E_1 is already part of the sum. Let me think again.\n\nWhen n=1: E_1=1 +3=4.\n\nIf I apply the formula E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, it works.\n\nBut when I unroll E_n, I get E_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^n*E_1.\n\nBut for n=1, that would be sum_{k=0}^0 3^k=1 +3^1*4=1 +12=13, which is wrong. So, the unrolling approach is incorrect because E_1 is not just 4, but it's already a sum. So, perhaps the formula E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct, and the unrolling approach is leading me astray because I'm not accounting for the fact that E_1 is a sum itself.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with the formula E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, which correctly gives E_9=29524, and thus the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the total expression is 3*E_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression, we recognize a pattern where each layer is defined recursively. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression grows exponentially. Using the formula for the nth term of this recursive sequence, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Recursive Terms:**\n   Let \\(E_n\\) represent the expression with \\(n\\) layers. Thus:\n   - \\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Continue this up to \\(E_9\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Each Layer:**\n   Compute each \\(E_n\\) sequentially:\n   - \\(E_1 = 4\\)\n   - \\(E_2 = 13\\)\n   - \\(E_3 = 40\\)\n   - \\(E_4 = 121\\)\n   - \\(E_5 = 364\\)\n   - \\(E_6 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(E_7 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(E_8 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(E_9 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Recognize the formula for \\(E_n\\) as \\(E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n=9\\):\n   \\[\n   E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply \\(E_9\\) by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should count how many times this nesting happens. Let me see: starting from the innermost part, each time I go one layer out, there's another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then that's enclosed in another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside each other. I think there are nine layers here because the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...), and so on, up to nine times. Wait, no, let me check again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see: innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(innermost), then the next is 1+3(that result), and so on, until we have nine layers. Wait, no, actually, let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, actually, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each time we have a new opening parenthesis. Let me count them: starting from the first 3, then each (1+3 adds another layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many 1+3 terms are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's enclosed by another set, so the number of layers is equal to the number of closing parentheses at the end. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. Let's consider that each time we have a 1+3(...) where ... is another 1+3(...). So, the number of times this repeats is equal to the number of layers. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer9, because the expression ends with nine layers. Wait, actually, let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3(...), so the total number of layers is 9. Let me check: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each time we add another layer, so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then each time another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, after the first 3, we have (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses is 9. Wait, no, let me count: starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), then another (1+3(...)), etc. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1. Then Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1). Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2). And this continues until Layer9, because the expression ends with nine layers. Wait, but the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time it's enclosed by another 1+3(...), and this continues until there are nine such enclosures. So, yes, there are nine layers. Therefore, I need to compute each layer starting from Layer1 up to Layer9, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is a nested expression with nine layers. So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the nested expression, which itself has nine layers. So, perhaps it's better to compute the nested expression first, starting from the innermost, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the innermost is 1+3, which would be Layer1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2), and so on up to Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1 as 1+3, Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in the given expression, the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested expression up to Layer9. But in my calculation, Layer9 is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The given expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, yes, the innermost is Layer1, and the outermost is Layer9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, the total expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the nested expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression directly by expanding each layer step by step, as I did earlier, but I think that's what I did already.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series.\n\nWait, but given that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a closed-form expression, which gives a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but let's see: the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 each time, but nested within each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as follows:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we've already computed a_9 = 29524, and E = 3*a_9, which is 88572, perhaps that's the simplest way.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nBut each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which we've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute E = 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term, repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n\n4. **Calculate the final result**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, I think I miscounted the number of nested expressions. Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears before the parentheses start closing. Let's see: Starting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). Then inside that, it's another 3 times (1 + 3 times something), and so on. I think there are nine sets of parentheses here because each \"1+3\" is followed by another set of parentheses until the last one, which is just 1+3. So, maybe I can work this out step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as a step. So, starting from the innermost part:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: The next layer out is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 1. So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 2. So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next, it's 1 + 3 times the result from Step 3. So, 1 + 3*40. That would be 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, hold on, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me check if I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, let's see:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nHmm, okay, but I'm not sure if I'm counting the steps correctly because the original expression has a lot of layers. Let me try to outline each step more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number each layer from the inside out, starting with the innermost as layer 1 and moving up. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) so after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, we work outward. But wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and the innermost part is 1 + 3, so maybe there are 9 layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nLooking at the original problem: It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*...), and the innermost is 1+3. Let me count how many times 1+3 appears before the parentheses close.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...), so each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is followed by another layer until the 9th layer, which is just 1+3, and then each layer wraps the previous one. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2 wraps that, up to layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times layer 9. So, I think that's 9 layers, each one wrapping the previous.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to layer 9 and got 29524, but then the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, we have to compute the outermost expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first \"1+3(\", then each subsequent one is another layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of \"1+3(\", each followed by another set of parentheses. So, the innermost is layer 9, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps the previous one, up to layer 1, which is the outermost 3*(...). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but wait: in our case, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nPlugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer):\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n=9, gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous result. By calculating each step and applying the final multiplication by 3, we find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), starting from the innermost \\(1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1 (Innermost):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the 3 is multiplied. It looks like it's nested nine times? Let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added 1, and so on, up to nine layers? Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So actually, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), which is two layers. Then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), which is three layers. So if I count all the way to the outermost, how many layers is that? Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time there's a 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), that's the second layer. Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), that's the third layer, and so on, until the ninth layer, which is the outermost. So, I think there are nine layers in total. Therefore, I can compute each layer from L1 to L9, starting with L1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Let me start with the innermost layer, which is L1: L1 = 1 + 3. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 is 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 40, so L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 is 1 + 3*(L4). L4 is 121, so L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 is 1 + 3*(L5). L5 is 364, so L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 is 1 + 3*(L6). L6 is 1093, so L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 is 1 + 3*(L7). L7 is 3280, so L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). L8 is 9841, so L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break it down. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, adding it up: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 8 7 2 8 5 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\nLet me write 29524 multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, but 29524 has only 5 digits. So, after the 9 in the ten thousands place, we have nothing else, so the carryover 2 would make it 27 + 2 = 29? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens) *3 =6 +1=7. Tens place:7, carryover 0.\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15. Hundreds place:5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28. Thousands place:8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8. Ten thousands place:8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed L9, I got 29524, right? Because L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern here that could have been generalized, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L1=4. So, it's a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p =1 => -2*L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)= (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^(n+1)-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3*(3^10)=3^11, so 3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplications. Since both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by the outermost 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Wait, let me check the original expression again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1.\n\nThen, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's count how many layers we have. Each 3*(...) corresponds to a layer, so starting from L1 as (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(L1) as L2. Then, 1 + 3*(L2) as L3, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(L9). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3*(1 + ...), each time, there's a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(... occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, moving outward, each 3*(1 + ...) is another layer. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses:\n\n- The first 3 is outside the first (1 + 3*(...))\n- The second 3 is inside that, outside the next (1 + ...)\n- And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 3s multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then, each time we go outward, we add another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's one 3.\n- Then, moving outward, each layer has a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, from the innermost, each step outward adds another 3. Let me count how many 3s there are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that the expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, if I start from the innermost, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the total would be 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Because when I started, L1 was (1 + 3), which is 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify that I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, each time we move outward, we add another layer. So, if I have 9 layers, then L9 would be the outermost. But wait, the expression is 3*(L9), so that would mean that the total expression is 3*(L9). So, let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression. Let me write it down step by step:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer.\n\nThen, each time we have 3*(1 + ...), that's another layer. Let me count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is layer 2.\n\n3. Then, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\n- The first 3*(1 + ...) is after the innermost (1 + 3), so that's layer 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, and each time we go outward, we add another 3*(1 + ...), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, starting from the first 3*(1 + ...), how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(1 + ...), each time there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers does that make? Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3): layer 1\n- Then, 3*(1 + 3*(layer 1)): layer 2\n- Then, 3*(1 + 3*(layer 2)): layer 3\n- And so on, until layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so that would be layer 9, and then the total expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), so that's layer 9, and the total expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), L2 is the next layer, and so on, until L9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nWait, actually, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\nx   3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0\n- 2 (the next digit) * 3 = 6, write 6\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\n\nNo more digits, so write 8.\n\nWait, that would be 8 8 5 7 2, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a geometric series of sorts, but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the nth term of this sequence.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u2192 -2*L_p = 1 \u2192 L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, n=9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each time, we have another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) after the initial 3*(...):\n\n- The first 3*(1 + ...) after the initial 3 is layer 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) appears. Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...) \u2192 layer 3\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 10? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each 3*(1 + ...) is another layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) after the initial 3*(...):\n\n- The first 3*(1 + ...) is after the initial 3, so that's layer 2.\n\n- Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + ...) is layer 3.\n\n- Continuing this way, each time we move outward, we add another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there in total?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...):\n\nEach 1 + 3*(...) adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...):\n\n- The first (1 + 3*(...)) has one opening parenthesis.\n\n- Then, each subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each time there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 first occurrence\n2. Inside that, 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 second occurrence\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let's see:\n\n- The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(1 + ...), each time there's another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) after the initial 3*(...):\n\n- The first one is after the initial 3, so that's 1.\n\n- Then, each time we go deeper, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur?\n\nLet me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each 3*(1 + ...) is another layer. So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, with L9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I calculated using the formula, L9 was 29524, and 3*L9 was 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the approach is correct.\n\nFor example, if the expression was just 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which would be 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing the formula, L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, then total expression is 3*L2 =39, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, another example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 =4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13 =40\n\nThen, total expression: 3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula, L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, total=3*40=120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers, gives us the total as 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Total = 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another, so I think there are 9 layers in total because each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and it's repeated 9 times. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3(1+3(...)) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, maybe it's 9 layers? Let me check: Each time I have a 1+3(...), and each time it's wrapped in another 3(1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(previous result), and so on, 9 times. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's start from the innermost part: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should verify using another approach to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That matches the L9 value I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but a_0 would be 1, since when n=0, a_0 is the base case. But in our case, n starts at 1, so maybe a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 = 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which is correct. So, the general formula for a_n would be a geometric series: a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*a_0, but since a_0 =1, perhaps that's not the right approach. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The recurrence relation approach gave me a closed-form solution, which seems accurate, so perhaps I don't need to go further into the geometric series. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the value using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step calculation and the recurrence relation method. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572. Just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Correct. So, all steps check out, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation leading to the final result. The computation results in the value 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\". Starting from the innermost part, each time there's a \"1+3\" followed by another set of parentheses. Let me count: 1. Innermost: 1+3 2. Then, moving out: 1+3(1+3) 3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3)) 4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) ... and so on. Wait, how many times does this happen? Let me check: Each time I move outward, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's see: The entire expression is 3 times something. That something is (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost part is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(innermost), then the next is 1+3*(previous layer), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. I think there are nine layers here because each \"1+3\" is nested inside another, and I can see nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 (1) Then, 1+3*(1+3) (2) Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)) (3) Continuing this way, up to nine layers. So, the expression is built as nine layers deep. Therefore, I can compute this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way outwards. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a formula for such expressions? It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D. If a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is L9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, I count nine sets of parentheses. Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3(...), so maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost one and then work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: the last parentheses is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So that part becomes 4. Then, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that step gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(40). That would be 1 + 120, which is 121. Okay, so 121.\n\nThen, the next one is 1 + 3*121. Let's see: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Hmm, 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, 3280.\n\nMoving out another step: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, 29524.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is 28572, so 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, 88573.\n\nNext, the outermost layer before the final multiplication: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8573 is 25719, so 240000 + 25719 is 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. So, 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount how many times I've computed each step. Starting from the innermost, I think I did nine layers because the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me check each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nWait, that's 11 steps, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Did I overcount? Let me check the original expression again. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is one layer, and each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent one is inside the previous. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\nThe outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the next layer. So, each time I go in, I add a layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n8. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n10. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\n- The first is 3*(1+3*(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1+3*(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, after a 3, there's a (1+3(...)). So, the number of such terms is equal to the number of times we have 1+3 inside. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nHow many times does 1+3 occur inside the parentheses? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each layer out adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1+3(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is inside:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then the next is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Continuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as having 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, each time, we have a new layer. So, maybe the number of layers is 9, which would mean that after starting from the innermost, we need to compute 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I ended up with 11 steps, which might be incorrect. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding result.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, starting with S1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 steps, S1 to S9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(S9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was doing it step by step, I ended up with 265720. That was because I went beyond 9 steps, which was a mistake. So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier by going beyond S9. So, after S9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*S9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, then each step adds another layer, so after 9 layers, S9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I first did it, I ended up with 265720, which was after 11 steps, which must be incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for S1 to S9.\n\nS1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3).\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1+3(1+3)).\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3))).\n4. Continuing until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count how many times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1+3(...)), and each of those contains another (1+3(...)), until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost.\n\nSo, from the expression, after each 3, there's a new (1+3(...)), and this happens 8 times? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times we have a 1+3 inside the parentheses. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3). Then, each time we go out, there's another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does 1+3 occur as a term inside the parentheses?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 S1\n2. (1+3(S1)) \u2192 S2\n3. (1+3(S2)) \u2192 S3\n4.

(1+3(S8)) \u2192 S9\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, S1 to S9, each time adding another layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*(S9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I initially did the calculation, I went beyond S9, which was a mistake. So, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by recalculating each step:\n\nS1: 1+3=4.\n\nS2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nS3: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nS4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nS5: 1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nS6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nS7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nS8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nS9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each step can be represented as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for S_n.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, S_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition S1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: S1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each step n, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: S1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: S4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: S5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: S6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: S7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: S8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: S9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9, S9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since S9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*S9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

    "text": " Hmm, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(...)). So each time, there's another 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, so there are nine layers here? Let me check again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each preceding one adds another layer. So actually, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers. So maybe I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. That sounds manageable. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. So, innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost, then L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the layers are L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. Let me confirm that. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers. So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is L9. Therefore, I can compute L1 through L9 step by step. Let me try to compute each layer one by one. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving on, L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for L9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, there are nine layers? Wait, let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time another 1+3*(...).

Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me check again: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. The innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out one layer, we add another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, L1 to L9, as I did before. So, the calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier at each step. Alternatively, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me check: If n=1, a_1 = 3^1*a_0 + (3^1 -1)/2. We have a_1=4, so 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. Therefore, 3*a_0 = 3, so a_0=1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^n*1 + (3^n -1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))). But expanding this would be tedious, so using the recurrence relation seems more efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the total expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. But perhaps I can write S in terms of itself, but I'm not sure because each layer is a different level. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as S = 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next layer. But since each layer is similar, perhaps S' = 3*(1 + S''), and so on, but this might not lead to a straightforward equation. Alternatively, since we've already found that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so S=3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I've confirmed this through multiple methods: step-by-step calculation, recurrence relation, and even trying to think of it as a geometric series. All methods point to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's getting big quickly. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, L5 is 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, so L6 is 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L7 is 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 is 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from L1 to L9: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, which is 1+3. Then, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, which matches. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, solving this recurrence relation, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for L9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. But since I've already solved it using the recursive method and verified with the closed-form solution, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recheck the multiplication steps. Starting from L9=29524, multiplying by 3: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all steps check out, and I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we find that each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Solving the recurrence relation gives a closed-form expression, confirming the value of the innermost layer as 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I can count how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after each 3, so let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine layers in total, right? So the innermost part is the 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, L1 = 4. Now, moving outward to L2, which is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Moving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. L4 = 121. Now, L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 363 + 1 = 364. So, L5 = 364. Next, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, L6 = 1093. Moving on to L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, L7 = 3280. Now, L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Finally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Wait a second, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer, L1 through L9: L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since I already have the result, perhaps this is the most straightforward way. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches L2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, matches L3. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by step-by-step computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute L9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is growing exponentially, so using the formula is more efficient.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result as using the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula to find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**  \n   \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Layer 2 (L2):**  \n   \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Layer 3 (L3):**  \n   \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Layer 4 (L4):**  \n   \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Layer 5 (L5):**  \n   \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Layer 6 (L6):**  \n   \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Layer 7 (L7):**  \n   \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Layer 8 (L8):**  \n   \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (L9):**  \n   \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3 to get the result:  \n\\( 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, I think I need to count how many layers there are here. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost part is 1+3, then each layer wraps that with 1+3*(previous layer). Let me try to count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then that's wrapped by 1+3*(1+3). Then that's wrapped by 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3(...). Wait, actually, each layer has a 3 multiplied by the next expression. Let me try to see how many times this happens. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count the number of 3s: starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds a 3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another set. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each time we have a 3*(...). Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds a 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3: There's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, the first layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Each layer adds a 3, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first 3. Then each layer adds another 3. So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 3*(1+3), then the next is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, each time you go a layer out, you add another 3*(...). Let me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). This continues until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute from the innermost layer outward, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute that: 3*29524\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each Layer n can be represented as a geometric series or something.\n\nWait, each Layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1=4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, let me think. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant.\n\nSo, let's assume Layer n = A*3^n + C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSo, equate left and right:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nThen, -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer1=4. Let's see if this works.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, Layer n =1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer1=4.\n\nIf we use the general solution Layer n = A*3^n + C, with C=-1/2, then Layer1= A*3^1 + (-1/2)= 3A -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, Layer n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check for n=1: Layer1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: Layer2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nYes, so Layer n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if I can think of another way to approach this problem, maybe using geometric series.\n\nEach Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, etc.\n\nIf I consider the expression as 3*(Layer9), and Layer9= (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*something, so if I expand it, maybe it's a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nBut I think the way I did it before is sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap: Starting from the innermost layer, compute each layer step by step, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Do this 9 times, then multiply the final result by 3 again.\n\nThe step-by-step computation gave me 88572, and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation also gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing through 9 layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when there are multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of levels. Let me make sure I have 9 levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Level1)\n\nThen each next level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level). Let's count:\n\nLevel1: 4\n\nLevel2: 13\n\nLevel3: 40\n\nLevel4: 121\n\nLevel5: 364\n\nLevel6: 1093\n\nLevel7: 3280\n\nLevel8: 9841\n\nLevel9: 29,524\n\nYes, that's 9 levels, each time adding a new layer. So the outermost expression is 3*(Level9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))).\n\nSo, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's level1, and each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level). So, yes, 9 levels in total, leading to 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote L_n as the nth level, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost expression**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next level**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should count how many times the pattern repeats. Let's see: Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s. Wait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by a term, so maybe each layer adds another multiplication. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? That would be 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Maybe I can denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 would be 1 + 3*L2. L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, and then it's closed by the corresponding \")\". So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer, so total layers would be 9. Wait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(...))) where there are 9 instances of \"1+3\". Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so that's 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. But in my earlier calculation, I only went up to L8, which would be 8 layers. Hmm, maybe I missed one layer.\n\nWait, let's recount. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (L1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (L2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(L2) = 40 (L3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (L4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (L5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (L6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (L7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (L8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (L9)\n\nWait, so I think I stopped at L8 earlier, but there are actually 9 layers, so I need to compute up to L9. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, L1 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing all layers up to L9, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost part is L1, so the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 before the closing parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2014 this is the innermost part before the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is the 9th layer. So, when I computed L9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly accounted for all layers. So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is L1. Then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). So, for each opening parenthesis after the first 3, we have another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, so that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, L1 to L9, which I computed correctly up to L9=29524, and then the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in each step. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that looks correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the expression would be a geometric series or something, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: If each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, then perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me model it as such.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this formula because it seems consistent with all the layers I computed manually. So, if a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as above. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this expression without expanding each layer by using the formula. Let me try that approach as a check.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think of it as a sum, maybe I can express it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, so each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=n, but with some coefficient.\n\nWait, but in L1, it's 1 + 3 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, L2 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = 13.\n\nSo, yes, it's matching the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as a geometric series, but since each layer is built upon the previous, it's more efficient to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute the total expression using the formula without computing each layer. Let me see.\n\nSince the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*(1) = 3, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nWait, so that's a more efficient way to compute it. So, the entire expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: Each time we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. But since it's a finite number of layers, it's a bit more involved, but perhaps using the formula for a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence approach, we found that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nBut that might not be as straightforward. Alternatively, considering that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and also using the formula, and both give me the same result, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches.\n\nFor example, a_3 should be 40. Using the formula, a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more the multiplication by 3. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula approach: (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) as follows:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, a new 1 + 3(...) is added. Let me count how many 1 + 3(...) there are. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 +\" appears after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to count the number of 3s in the expression. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 3*(...), etc. Let me count how many 3s there are. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set. So, how many 3s are there? Let's count:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost one.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3.\n3. Continuing this way, each time I go one layer in, I encounter another 3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let me count the number of times 3 appears in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on until the innermost 3, which is part of 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me see: the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then, each time we go out a layer, we add another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, perhaps? Because the expression seems to have 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, to compute this, I should start from the innermost layer and work my way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer, and each time we go out a layer, we add another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)), etc., until the innermost 1 + 3. Let me count how many times \"1 +\" appears after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nUp to 9 times? Wait, let me see: Each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\n- The first one after the initial 3 is 1 + 3(...\n- Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, each time, a new (1 + 3( starts. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3.\n\nEach ( corresponds to a new layer. So, from the initial 3, how many ( are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( in this part.\n\nLooking at it: (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nIn the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. ( after the first 3\n2. ( after the first 3(...\n3. ( after that, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time we have a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\nWait, this seems like 9 layers because each time we have another 1 + 3(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with ))))))))). So, that's 9 closing parentheses after the innermost 1 + 3. So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, L1 to L9, as I initially thought.\n\nSo, going back, I computed up to L9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n-----------\n(4 \u00d7 3) = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n(2 \u00d7 3) = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n(5 \u00d7 3) = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n(9 \u00d7 3) = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n(2 \u00d7 3) = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression after the initial 3 is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses in this part.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the first ( is after 3, then each \"1 + 3(\" introduces another (.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 3(1 + 3\n3. ( after 3(1 + 3(1 + 3\n4.

Wait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" does have a (. Let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another (. Let me count the number of ( in this part.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n11. )\n12. )\n...\nWait, that seems like 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each corresponding to a layer.\n\nSo, that means there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9, as I initially thought.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of 88,572 should be correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} =177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step calculation was correct. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the 1 + 3(...) pattern occurs. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, actually, let's see: each time, the expression is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is the last 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s or the number of operations. Wait, actually, let's parse the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a sum, which is 1 plus 3 times another sum, which is 1 plus 3 times another sum, and so on. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. So the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the previous step), which is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer's value. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, I have:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nI wonder if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It seems like each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That sounds like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this. Let me think about how to solve such a recurrence. The general form for a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c is 3 and d is 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = (a_1 + d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} - d/(1 - c). Wait, let me make sure I have that right. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*c^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = c*B + d => B - c*B = d => B(1 - c) = d => B = d/(1 - c). So the general solution is a_n = A*c^{n} + B. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*c^{1} + B => A*c + B = 4. But since B = d/(1 - c), which is 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So substituting B into the equation: A*3 + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying that, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I calculated earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Now, how many layers are there in the original expression? Let's see, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see how many layers there are in total.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to count the number of 3s in the expression. Let me try that. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside the first parenthesis, we have 1 + 3(...). So each time, we have a 3 multiplying a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each layer has a 3 multiplying the next parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(...)) => 1 three inside\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3(...)) => another three inside\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the first layer. Then moving outward, each time we have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n- The first parenthesis after the initial 3 is the innermost: 1 + 3(...). That's one layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, I think. Let me count:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(...)) => 1 opening\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) => 2 openings\n- Continuing this way, each layer adds another opening parenthesis until the 9th opening parenthesis, which is the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of 3s inside the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is outside. Then inside, we have 3(...), then inside that another 3(...), etc. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3) => 1 three\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) => 2 threes\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) => 3 threes\n...\nContinuing this, how many threes are there? Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first three. Then each layer adds another three. So if the expression has n layers, there are n threes.\n\nWait, but looking at the expression, after the initial 3, how many times does 3 appear? Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is outside: 3(...)\n\nInside that, we have 3(...), so that's the second 3.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(...): third 3.\n\nContinuing this until the innermost 3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there in total? Let me count the number of times 3 appears in the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. The initial 3\n2. Then inside, another 3\n3. Inside that, another 3\n...\nHow many times does 3 appear? Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to another 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first parenthesis after the initial 3 is the innermost: 1 + 3(...). Then each layer adds another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2: 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another ( at position 5: 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Continuing this, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis, so the number of 3s after the initial one is equal to the number of layers. Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first 3 after the initial one. Then each layer adds another 3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: ... (1 + 3))))))).\n\nWait, the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses, I think. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another ). So, how many ) are there at the end? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the innermost 1 + 3, we have 9 closing parentheses. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. Then the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nEach layer adds one more closing parenthesis. So, the innermost has 0 closing parentheses after it, then each layer adds one more. So, the total number of closing parentheses at the end is 8? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the innermost 1 + 3, there are 8 closing parentheses. Let me count:\n\nAfter the innermost 1 + 3, the expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another ). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3), which adds one ), then the next layer adds another ), etc., until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1 + 3 is 8. Therefore, the number of layers is 9? Because starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each closing parenthesis adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of times 1 + 3 occurs. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 appears, which is 9 times? Because the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is outside. Then inside that, we have 3(...), which is the second 3. Then inside that, another 3(...), which is the third 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. Initial 3\n2. Then 3 inside the first parenthesis\n3. Then 3 inside the second parenthesis\n...\nHow many 3s are there in total? Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is outside: 1\n- Then inside that, each time we have a 3 before the next parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me see how many times 3 appears after the initial one.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3. So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the first 3 after the initial one. Then each layer adds another 3. So, if I have n layers, there are n 3s after the initial one.\n\nWait, but the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, the number of 3s inside is 8. Because after the initial 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses, and there are 8 more 3s. So total 3s are 9.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\n1. Initial 3\n2. Then 3(1 + 3(...)) => second 3\n3. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) => third 3\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is the first. Then inside, each 3 is another one. Let me count:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(...)) => 2\n- Inside that, another 3(...) => 3\n- Inside that, another 3(...) => 4\n- And so on, until the innermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth 3. So, total number of 3s is 9. Therefore, the number of layers is 9. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 8 layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the initial 3 is outside, and then each layer inside adds another 3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s after the initial one, which is 8. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside: 1\n2. Then inside that, another 3: 2\n3. Inside that, another 3: 3\n4. Inside that, another 3: 4\n5. Inside that, another 3: 5\n6. Inside that, another 3: 6\n7. Inside that, another 3: 7\n8. Inside that, another 3: 8\n9. Inside that, another 3: 9\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth 3. So, there are 9 threes in total. Therefore, the number of layers is 9. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 8 layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as having 9 layers, each defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nBut earlier, I derived that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if there are 9 layers, then n would be 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check: if n=1, a_1=4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBut wait, the initial expression is 3 multiplied by a_9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, the total value would be 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, that's 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the total value is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I have the correct number of layers. Earlier, I thought that the number of layers is 9, so a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first opening parenthesis after the initial 3: 1\n- Then another opening parenthesis: 2\n- And so on until the last opening parenthesis before the final closing parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by a parenthesis. Inside that, another parenthesis, etc., until the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\n1. After the initial 3: (\n2. Inside that: (\n3. Inside that: (\n4. Inside that: (\n5. Inside that: (\n6. Inside that: (\n7. Inside that: (\n8. Inside that: (\n9. Inside that: (\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, which means there are 9 layers. Therefore, the number of layers is 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing step by step, manually, to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, to summarize, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. There are 9 layers, so a_9 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by the result of Layer 9**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3( ... ). Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can evaluate each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's see: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 1 + 120 = 121. So, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). That would be 1 + 363 = 364. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*(1093). So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's calculate that: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). That would be 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 1 + 88572 = 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 88573. Let me calculate that: 3 * 88573. Well, 80,000 * 3 = 240,000, 8,000 * 3 = 24,000, 500 * 3 = 1,500, 70 * 3 = 210, and 3 * 3 = 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3 * 88,573 is 265,719. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88,573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, carryover 2; 3*5=15 + 2=17, carryover 1; 3*8=24 + 1=25, carryover 2; 3*8=24 + 2=26. So, writing it down: 265,719. Yep, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then repeating that process. Each time, the result was used in the next outer layer until we reached the outermost parentheses, and then we multiplied the final result by 3 to get the answer. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 265,719. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each nested expression as a term. Let's say each layer is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of nesting inside the outermost 3*(...). Wait, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, that's another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). There are 9 opening parentheses after the 3, so that would imply 9 layers. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, the general formula for such a recursive relation a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved. The solution to this recurrence relation is a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify that. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation where I got a_9 as 88,573. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in my initial step-by-step, I had a_9 as 88,573, but according to this formula, a_9 is 29,524. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers, but according to the formula, a_9 is the 9th term, which would correspond to 9 layers. But in my manual calculation, I had 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9 = 88,573. But according to the formula, a_9 is 29,524. So, that suggests that my manual calculation might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is 1 layer. Then each time we have (1 + 3*(...)), so each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: After the first 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). Inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Starting from the first one after the initial 3(, that's 1. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(, that's 2. Continuing, each time we have another 1 + 3(, so let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.     1 + 3(\n3.         1 + 3(\n4.             1 + 3(\n5.                 1 + 3(\n6.                     1 + 3(\n7.                         1 + 3(\n8.                             1 + 3(\n9.                                 1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3). Then layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer9). Up to layer 1: 1 + 3*(layer2). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer1). So, in terms of the formula, the total expression is 3*a_1, where a_1 corresponds to layer1, which is 1 + 3*a_2, and a_2 is 1 + 3*a_3, etc., down to a_9 = 1 + 3. So, using the formula, a_9 = 4, as before. Then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_1 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait a second, that's different from my initial calculation where I thought the total was 265,719. So, which one is correct? Let's see. When I did the step-by-step earlier, I ended up with 88,573 after the innermost layers, then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. But according to the formula, a_1 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 = 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers in my initial step-by-step. Let me go back. When I did the step-by-step, I had the innermost as (1 + 3) = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524, and then 1 + 3*29524=88573. Wait, but that's 10 layers, not 9. Because starting from (1+3) as layer1, then each subsequent step adds another layer. So, in my initial step-by-step, I went from layer1 to layer10, but according to the formula, it's only 9 layers. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me clarify. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.     1 + 3(\n3.         1 + 3(\n4.             1 + 3(\n5.                 1 + 3(\n6.                     1 + 3(\n7.                         1 + 3(\n8.                             1 + 3(\n9.                                 1 + 3(\n10.                                    1 + 3\n\nWait, but at the innermost, it's just (1 + 3), without another \"1 + 3(\" after that. So, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1. Then moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, so layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9. So, the total expression is 3*(layer1). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try a different approach. The expression is 3*(expression), where the expression is 1 + 3*(another expression), and so on, 9 times. So, the depth is 9. So, when I calculated up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, that would be layer10, but according to the formula, it's only 9 layers. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I went one layer too far. Let me redo the step-by-step with the correct number of layers. Starting from layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. layer2: 1 + 3*4 =13. layer3: 1 + 3*13=40. layer4: 1 + 3*40=121. layer5: 1 + 3*121=364. layer6: 1 + 3*364=1093. layer7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. layer8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. layer9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the correct answer. Therefore, my initial mistake was counting one extra layer, leading to an incorrect final result. So, the correct answer is 88,572. Let me confirm this with the formula. As per the formula, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. For k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches. So, the correct answer is 88,572. Therefore, my initial step-by-step had an error in the number of layers, leading to an incorrect final result. After correcting that, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and then another parenthesis.

Wait, let me check: Starting from the first 3, the expression inside is 1 + 3(...), and each time we have another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can nest these expressions. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the first 3(...). The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, there's another (1+3(...)), and so on until we reach the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a new layer.

Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until we reach the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many layers are there?

Layer 9: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, and the innermost is layer 1. So, to compute this, I should start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer and compute them one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nSo, the total would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have these nested expressions, especially with multiplication, you might have to consider the order of operations differently. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, or alternatively, find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. 4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. 5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. 6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. 7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. 8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. 10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times that entire nested expression. So after computing the innermost part and working outwards, the final result before multiplying by 3 is 88573. Then, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 88573. Let's do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 88573 * 3: 3*3=9, write down 9. 3*7=21, carry over 2. 3*5=15 + 2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2. 3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. But wait, there are no more digits, so write down 2. So, 3*88573=265,719. Hmm, but wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n   88573\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9, write down 9.\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write down 1 and carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, plus the carried over 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus the carried over 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus the carried over 2 is 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carried over 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265,719. Hmm, but wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 88,573 \u00d7 3 by breaking it down: 80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000. 8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000. 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500. 70 \u00d7 3 = 210. 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. Now, adding these together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500. 265,500 + 210 = 265,710. 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 265,719. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another, so from the innermost, each step adds a layer. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, the expression is 1+3*(...), so each layer adds one more opening parenthesis. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), so that's one layer. Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3. Let me see, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me check: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if I start from the innermost, that's 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another, so 1, 2, 3,... up to 9 layers. So, I think I did 9 layers correctly earlier, ending up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, resulting in 265,719. Hmm, but wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost, and see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, right? Because starting from Layer 1 as (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another, up to Layer 10. So, the outermost expression is Layer 10, which is 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but now I'm seeing 10 layers. Let me check the original expression again to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 is present. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer adds another. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 10. Therefore, the outermost expression is Layer 10, which is 88573, and then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 9 layers, but now it's 10. Let me make sure. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Each time we have a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 1\n2. (1+3(...) \u2192 2\n3. (1+3(...) \u2192 3\n4. (1+3(...) \u21924\n5. (1+3(...) \u21925\n6. (1+3(...) \u21926\n7. (1+3(...) \u21927\n8. (1+3(...) \u21928\n9. (1+3(...) \u21929\n10. (1+3(...) \u219210\n\nWait, so that's 10 opening parentheses after each 1+3, meaning there are 10 layers. So, I think my initial calculation was wrong when I thought it was 9 layers. It's actually 10 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 10 as 88573, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 10, so L_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, L_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result. So, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=10, it's (3^11 - 1)/2, which is 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n3 * 88573 = 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

Wait, actually, each time I go into another parenthesis, that's one more layer. Let me check again. Starting from the leftmost 3, it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, it's 1 + 3 times another (1 + 3(...)), so that's the second layer. Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost part is 1+3, so that's the 9th layer? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so the first layer is the initial 3. Then inside that, there are 8 more 3s, right? Because each \"3(\" is a new layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers? Wait, no, let me see. Let me write the expression with numbers to count the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3( ... ))  \nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3( ... ))  \nLayer 3: 3(1 + 3( ... ))  \n... and so on until Layer 9: 3(1 + 3)  \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is not multiplied by another 3, so maybe the layers are fewer. Let me try to write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 9 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841 = 29523  \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here because I only counted 9 layers, but the expression seems to have more. Let me check again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: starting from the first 3, the first \"(\" is layer 1, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3*(...  \n2. 1 + 3*(...  \n3. 1 + 3*(...  \n... and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" adds a new layer, so how many times does this happen? Let's see: starting from the first 3, each time we enter a new \"1 + 3*(...)\", that's a new layer. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is layer 9, and then each layer above that adds another 3*(...). So, in total, there are 9 layers, right? Because each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with 9 layers, ending at 29523. But let me verify each step carefully because I might have made an error in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me start over and compute each layer step by step, making sure I get each step right.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841 = 29523  \n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplications again because that's where mistakes often happen.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 8: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 7: 3*13 = 39, 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 6: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 5: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 4: 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 3: 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 2: 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final result is 29523. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Starting from the innermost, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer above adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. 1 + 3  \n2. 1 + 3(  \n3. 1 + 3(  \n... up to 9 layers. Wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, so that's the first layer, then each time you go out, it's another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to 29523. But wait, I just realized that in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer above is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer2, and so on until layer9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, the answer should be 29523. But let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n... and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous part, the characteristic equation is r = 3, so the solution is based on that. But since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can find B by setting the equation equal to a constant. Let me set a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 29523. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step calculation. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, according to the formula, a_9 should be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. But in my step-by-step, I got 29523. So, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step calculation. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524. So, where is the mistake? Let me check the formula again. The formula gives a_n as the value at layer n, which is the innermost layer. Wait, no, in the formula, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, and a_9 would be the 9th layer, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, in the step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 1 as 29523, which is 3*(Layer 2). But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which is Layer 2 in my step-by-step. So, Layer 2 is 9841, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524. So, there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have miscounted the layers. Let me clarify: in the formula, a_n is the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 4 (innermost), a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because in my step-by-step, I ended up with 29523, which is 3*9841. So, I think I misapplied the formula. Let me clarify the layers again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then each layer above is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 1 as 29523, which would be 3*a_9, but according to the formula, a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 would be 88572. But that contradicts my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is the first layer. Then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3  \n2. 1 + 3(  \n3. 1 + 3(  \n4. 1 + 3(  \n5. 1 + 3(  \n6. 1 + 3(  \n7. 1 + 3(  \n8. 1 + 3(  \n9. 1 + 3(  \n10. 1 + 3(  \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3*(...  \n2. 1 + 3*(...  \n3. 1 + 3*(...  \n4. 1 + 3*(...  \n5. 1 + 3*(...  \n6. 1 + 3*(...  \n7. 1 + 3*(...  \n8. 1 + 3*(...  \n9. 1 + 3*(...  \n10. 1 + 3*(...  \n11. 1 + 3*(...  \n12. 1 + 3*(...  \n13. 1 + 3*(...  \n14. 1 + 3*(...  \n15. 1 + 3*(...  \n16. 1 + 3*(...  \n17. 1 + 3*(...  \n18. 1 + 3*(...  \n19. 1 + 3*(...  \n20. 1 + 3*(...  \n\nWait, that can't be right. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is layer 1.\n- Then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...  \n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...  \n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...  \n... and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, I think there are 9 \"1 + 3(\" layers, meaning that a_9 is the innermost, and the outermost is a_1. Wait, no, that's conflicting with the formula. Let me think differently. Let me consider that the innermost expression is the 9th layer, and each layer above is one less. So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But in my step-by-step, I ended up with 29523, which is 3*a_9 where a_9 was 9841, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers in the step-by-step approach. Let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nLet me write down the layers again, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But earlier, in my step-by-step, I only went up to Layer9 as 9841, which was incorrect. I think I stopped one layer too early. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at Layer8 as 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which is incorrect because I missed the last layer. So, the correct total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1: 4. Then each layer above is 1 + 3*previous, up to Layer9: 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I thought Layer9 was 9841, but that's incorrect. Actually, Layer9 is 29524, as per the formula. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. The formula says a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to Layer8 as 9841, which is incorrect. So, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers properly.\n\nThe expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", starting from the innermost. So, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the answer was 29523, but that was because I stopped at Layer8 and multiplied by 3. So, I must have miscounted the layers. The correct number of layers is 9, leading to 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with the formula. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I only computed up to Layer8 and got 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. That was incorrect because I missed the last layer. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to make sure I have the correct number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" expressions:\n\n1. 1 + 3  \n2. 1 + 3*(...  \n3. 1 + 3*(...  \n4. 1 + 3*(...  \n5. 1 + 3*(...  \n6. 1 + 3*(...  \n7. 1 + 3*(...  \n8. 1 + 3*(...  \n9. 1 + 3*(...  \n10. 1 + 3*(...  \n\nWait, no, that's 9 \"1 + 3*(...)\" expressions, starting from the innermost. So, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I initially miscounted the layers, stopping at Layer8 and not going all the way to Layer9, which led to the incorrect result of 29523. After realizing the mistake and recounting the layers, I see that the correct answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula for such a series is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since we start from a_1 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find the value at the innermost layer and propagate it outward. The final result is obtained by multiplying the value of the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next nested term. The innermost term is \\(1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Recognizing the pattern, the nth term \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Final Computation:** Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the 3 is multiplied. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 3(1 + ... So maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try to parse it. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression. Wait, maybe I should number them from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on. Let me try that approach. Let me start by computing the innermost expression first. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the next layer. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so that's the third layer. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, the results are 4, 13, 40. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. That's interesting. Now, the next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wait, 1093? That seems like a prime number, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Hmm, 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count: starting from the innermost, 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers would be equal to the number of times 3 appears as a multiplier. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see: starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of times we have 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count: 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(...)\n2. Inside that: 3(...)\n3. Inside that: 3(...)\n4. Inside that: 3(...)\n5. Inside that: 3(...)\n6. Inside that: 3(...)\n7. Inside that: 3(...)\n8. Inside that: 3(...)\n9. Inside that: 3(...)\n10. Inside that: 3(...)\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous one. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each inside the previous parentheses. So, in total, we have 9 layers, each with a 3 multiplier. So, the innermost is layer 9, then moving outward to layer 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by stopping at layer 9, but maybe I need to compute each layer from 1 to 9, then multiply by the outermost 3. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to 3*(29524), but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully. Let me define each layer as E1 to E9, where E9 is the innermost expression, and E1 is the outermost. So, E9: 1 + 3 = 4. E8: 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E7: 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E6: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E5: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E4: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E3: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E2: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E1: 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E1, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer:\n\nE9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE1: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E1, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Because sometimes when you count layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each inside the previous parentheses. So, that's 9 layers in total, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, up to the first 3, which is layer 1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I labeled E9 as the innermost, which is correct, and E1 as the outermost. So, I think I did it right.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me write down each layer with its corresponding expression:\n\nLayer 9 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, no, actually, in my earlier approach, layer 1 was the outermost, corresponding to n=9. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, in the problem, the innermost layer is the 9th layer, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier calculation where E1 was 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step. That's a good way to verify.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. In this case, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the total expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it: the entire expression can be represented as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step once more.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This kind of recurrence relation leads to exponential growth, which is why the numbers get so large quickly. The formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, perfectly captures this growth, allowing us to compute the result without manually calculating each layer.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable layers and recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression, I was able to compute the value step by step and verify it using a formula. This approach ensures accuracy and efficiency, especially for more complex or deeply nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the result of each step and substitute it into the next. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a formula, we determine the final value.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9 (outermost): 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe if I count the number of 3s, that could help. Let me see: starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by a big expression. Inside that expression, there's a 1 plus another 3 times another expression, and this pattern repeats multiple times. I think the key here is to recognize that this is a nested expression with multiple layers, so I should start simplifying from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me note that down: Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, this result is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So, the next layer out is: 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Wait, let me check that again. If I have 1 + 3*13, that's 1 + 39, which is indeed 40. Okay, moving on. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, interesting. So, that layer is 121. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364. Next layer out: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let me do that step by step: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer out: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Next layer out: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(result from the previous step). Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after all those layers, the innermost parentheses worked their way out, and the last result was 88573. So, now, the entire expression is 3*88573. Let me compute that. 88573 * 3. Let me break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me verify each step quickly. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Finally, 3*88573=265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 265,719 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost (1 + 3) and working outward until the entire expression is evaluated. The final result is 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. So starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward each time. Let me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, so now I can replace the innermost two layers with 13. Let me see if that's correct. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, now we have 40. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.

Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, each time there's a 1+3(, so how many times does 1+3( appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another 1+3(\n3. Another 1+3(\n4. Another 1+3(\n5. Another 1+3(\n6. Another 1+3(\n7. Another 1+3(\n8. Another 1+3(\n9. Another 1+3(\n10. And then the innermost (1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(, starting from the first one after the initial 3(, and then each subsequent one. So, in total, there are 9 layers to compute before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I had 10 steps, from 4 up to 29524, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 7 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple steps.\n\nSo, let's go through each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, L9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times ... ))) So, does that mean that we have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the final 3* that result?\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, if each layer is built upon the previous one, then starting from L1 to L9, each time computing 1 + 3*previous, and then the final step is 3*L9.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, we have 1+3(...), and each time another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3( before the last closing parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3(, so how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another 1+3(\n3. Another 1+3(\n4. Another 1+3(\n5. Another 1+3(\n6. Another 1+3(\n7. Another 1+3(\n8. Another 1+3(\n9. Another 1+3(\n10. Then the innermost (1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3( before the innermost (1+3). So, perhaps I have 9 layers, meaning L1 to L9, each time computing 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had L1 as (1+3), L2 as 1+3*L1, up to L9, which is correct, so 9 layers, and then the final 3*L9.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then my calculation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous. So, each layer is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me consider that each time, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, perhaps this can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculations.\n\nSo, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for f(n).\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, f(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, in general, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation of L9 being 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers or 8 layers. Because when I count the number of 1+3( in the original expression, I see that after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of 1+3( before the innermost (1+3). Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the initial expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 1+3(, except the innermost which is (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nEach 1+3( introduces another layer, so:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. Then the innermost (1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers after the initial 3(, meaning n=9 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, f(9) = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using two different methods, step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, to ensure consistency.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the previous layer itself is a geometric series, the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3, the closed-form formula we derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, after carefully stepping through each layer and verifying with a formula, I can conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( L_i \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\n1. Compute \\( L_1 \\):\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( L_2 \\):\n   \\[ L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Compute \\( L_3 \\):\n   \\[ L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Compute \\( L_4 \\):\n   \\[ L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Compute \\( L_5 \\):\n   \\[ L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Compute \\( L_6 \\):\n   \\[ L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Compute \\( L_7 \\):\n   \\[ L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Compute \\( L_8 \\):\n   \\[ L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Compute \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[ L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I can count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, is there a total of nine layers? Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3 around it. So, maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next layer's value. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that Layer 9 value, right? Because the problem starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication carefully.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. I started with the innermost as Layer 1, and each time I moved outwards, adding a layer. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses inside the initial 3(...). So, let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) step.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each time moving outwards, so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3, we get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me try another approach to see if I can find a formula or a pattern that might give me the same result without computing each layer step by step, just to cross-verify.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula and see if they match.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the formula works for the initial layers, so it's reliable.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is nine times, right? Because each layer is multiplied by 3 once.\n\nWait, but when I used the formula, I found that a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step, though it might get lengthy.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, E9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is building a geometric progression.\n\nWait, considering the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can express a_n as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, which we solved earlier, and found a closed-form solution of a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 - 1 over 2, which is 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with fewer layers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version of the problem with just two layers:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nFirst, compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Then, 3*a_2 = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for three layers:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence.\n\nThus, applying it to nine layers, the result should indeed be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute a few more layers using the formula and step-by-step to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute a_4 using both methods.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nUsing the formula: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, and formula: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, formula: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, formula: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, formula: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, formula: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, each step is consistent with the formula, so I can be confident that the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and verification with smaller cases. Each method points to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward.

So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. That sounds manageable. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nLet me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNow, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times this Layer 8 expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, after computing Layer 8 as 9841, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3*9841: Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*9841 another way to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 9841 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n9841\n\u00d7   3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 29523.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, each layer seems to follow a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can find another condition. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is layer 8, so a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula confirmed the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 29523.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but in this case, since the expression is finite with eight layers, computing each step was manageable.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the outermost layer, which when multiplied by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I can count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me see: starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a similar expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another one. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then moving outward, each time another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by each parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. It seems like there are nine layers here because each time we add another 3. Wait, let me check. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count how many times I see \"1 + 3(\" before a closing parenthesis. Let me try to parse it:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, it's (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of times \"1+3\" appears without being inside another set of parentheses. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that each layer adds a new multiplication by 3. Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out.\n\nSo, let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each inner expression as E_n, where n is the level. So, E_1 is the innermost, E_2 is the next one out, and so on, up to E_9, which is the outermost expression. Wait, but actually, let me check how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time I have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, which itself contains another 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, etc. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the initial expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until the ninth layer, which would be the innermost (1 + 3). Wait, no, let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: each time we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis, so starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis. So, the first 3 is at the beginning, then each subsequent layer adds another 3. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is one layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until the ninth layer. Wait, no, let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the expression. So, the expression starts with 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the start, the first 3( is one, then inside that, another 3(, which is two, and so on until the innermost 3(1 + 3). So, how many 3( are there? Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, that can't be right because the innermost is just (1 + 3), not 3(1 + 3). Let me check again. The innermost is (1 + 3), so the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3) \u2192 this is the innermost, but wait, actually, no. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3), but the expression is built as 3(1 + 3(...)), so perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3(1 + ...). Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step. So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the next layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define E_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, E_1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then E_2 is 3*(1 + E_1), E_3 is 3*(1 + E_2), and so on, up to E_9, which would be the outermost expression. Wait, but let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears after the initial 3. So, in the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s that are followed by a \"(\": that would indicate the start of a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 first layer\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 second layer\n3. And so on until the innermost layer.\n\nWait, but the innermost layer is just (1 + 3), without another 3( after that. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me count the number of 3( in the expression. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 4\n5. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 5\n6. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 6\n7. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 7\n8. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 8\n9. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, but the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is layer 9, right? Because each layer adds another 3( before it. So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me confirm by counting the number of 3( in the expression.\n\nYes, from the initial 3(, then each subsequent 3( inside adds another layer, and there are 9 such layers. So, I can compute each layer from E_1 to E_9, where E_1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and E_9 is the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but actually, when I look at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but when I look back at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so the outermost expression is E_9, which is 3*(1 + E_8), which we computed as 36084.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), right? Because each time we have another 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, if I have 9 layers, then E_9 is the outermost expression, which is 3*(1 + E_8) = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 layer 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u2192 layer 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2192 layer 4\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) \u2192 layer 5\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 layer 6\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 layer 7\n8. 3(1 + 3) \u2192 layer 8\n9. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is layer 9, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 8 is 3*(1 + layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 7 is 3*(1 + layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 6 is 3*(1 + layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5 is 3*(1 + layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 4 is 3*(1 + layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 3 is 3*(1 + layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 2 is 3*(1 + layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 1 is 3*(1 + layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression, which is layer 1, is 36084.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time. Wait, no, it's more like each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the recurrence relation is E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nSo, starting from E_9 = 4, then E_8 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on. So, this is a geometric progression, perhaps? Let me see if I can find a formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_9 = 4.\n\nLet me try to express E_n in terms of E_{n-1}. So, E_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3, with E_9 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, E_9 is the innermost, so when n=9, E_9=4, and then E_8 is computed as 3*(1 + E_9) = 15, and so on up to E_1.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a general formula for E_n in terms of n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3, with E_9 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3 \u2192 -2*A = 3 \u2192 A = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=9, E_9 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC*3^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nSo, C = (11/2) / 3^9 = (11)/(2*19683) = 11/39366.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (11/39366)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut since we're dealing with integer values, perhaps this approach isn't the most straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each E_n step by step as I did before, which seems more manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each step is 3*(previous +1), so each E_n = 3*(E_{n-1} +1).\n\nLet me compute the values again step by step to confirm:\n\nLayer 9: E_9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: E_8 = 3*(1 + E_9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 7: E_7 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 6: E_6 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: E_5 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 4: E_4 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 3: E_3 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 2: E_2 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 1: E_1 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the recurrence relation again: E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nThis can be rewritten as E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, and I think the solution would be of the form E_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nAs I did before, let's assume a particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3 \u2192 C - 3C = 3 \u2192 -2C = 3 \u2192 C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=9, E_9 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA*3^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nSo, A = (11/2) / 3^9 = 11/(2*19683) = 11/39366.\n\nThus, the general formula is E_n = (11/39366)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut when n=9, E_9 = (11/39366)*3^9 - 3/2 = (11/39366)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCalculating that: 19683 / 39366 = 0.5, so 11*0.5 = 5.5, then 5.5 - 1.5 = 4, which matches E_9=4.\n\nSimilarly, for n=8, E_8 = (11/39366)*3^8 - 3/2.\n\n3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, 11*6561 = 72171.\n\n72171 / 39366 \u2248 1.8333333.\n\nThen, 1.8333333 - 1.5 = 0.3333333, which is 1/3, which is 15/45, but that doesn't seem right because E_8 is 15.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, E_n = (11/39366)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSo, for n=8, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, (11/39366)*6561 = (11 * 6561) / 39366.\n\nLet me compute 6561 / 39366.\n\nWell, 39366 \u00f7 6561 \u2248 6, because 6561*6 = 39366.\n\nSo, 6561 / 39366 = 1/6.\n\nThus, (11/39366)*6561 = 11*(1/6) = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333333.\n\nThen, E_8 = 11/6 - 3/2 = 11/6 - 9/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 \u2248 0.3333333.\n\nWait, that can't be right because E_8 is supposed to be 15. Clearly, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence relation. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3, with E_9 = 4.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's try E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3 \u2192 A - 3A = 3 \u2192 -2A = 3 \u2192 A = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=9, E_9 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^9 - 3/2 \u2192 C*3^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nThus, C = (11/2) / 3^9 = 11/(2*19683) = 11/39366.\n\nSo, E_n = (11/39366)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, but when n=9, E_9 = (11/39366)*19683 - 3/2.\n\n19683 / 39366 = 0.5, so 11*0.5 = 5.5.\n\n5.5 - 1.5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=8, E_8 = (11/39366)*6561 - 3/2.\n\n6561 / 39366 = 0.166666... (since 6561*6=39366).\n\nSo, 11*0.166666... = 1.833333...\n\n1.833333... - 1.5 = 0.333333..., which is 1/3, but that's not matching our earlier computation of E_8=15.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence relation. Let me think again. The problem is that the recurrence starts at n=9, not n=0 or n=1. So, perhaps the general solution needs to be adjusted for the starting index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before, rather than trying to find a closed-form formula, especially since there are only 9 layers.\n\nGiven that, and since I've already computed each layer correctly step by step, resulting in E_1 = 36084, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just verify one more time with a different approach. Let's consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo, E_1 = 3*(1 + E_2), but wait, no, actually, E_1 is the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + E_2), where E_2 is the next layer. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me try to reindex it.\n\nLet me define E_1 as the innermost layer, which is 4. Then E_2 is the next layer out, which is 3*(1 + E_1) = 15, and so on up to E_9, which would be the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + E_8) = 36084.\n\nWait, so in this case, the outermost expression is E_9, which is 36084.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me see if I can express this as a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nFinally: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got before. So, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and each step seems correct. So, I'm confident that the result is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step, resulting in the final value of 36084.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 3*(1 + ...). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute from Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1 (Innermost): \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n   - Layer 9 (Outermost): \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\n3. **Final Result**: After computing each layer, the outermost expression evaluates to 36084.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me count how many times the \"1+3(...)\" part repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...) around it. Let me count them: 1. Innermost: (1+3) 2. Next layer: (1+3(1+3)) 3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3))) And so on. Wait, maybe I should count how many times this happens. Let me see: Starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, the innermost is just 1+3=4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then the next layer would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). So, that would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the next layer: 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(result from the previous layer)). So, that's (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that's 40. Next layer out: (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) = 4. Then, (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me list the results step by step: Step 1: 4 Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Step 10: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" occurs. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is layer 1. Then each time we go out, we have another layer. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), then each time we add another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, starting from layer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's what I got earlier. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nLet's take a smaller version: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost: (1+3) = 4\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3*(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120\n\nThat's correct. So, my approach seems to work for a smaller case. Therefore, I think my method is correct, and the final answer for the original problem is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me make sure I did each step correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the innermost Layer 1 is 4, and each subsequent layer is built by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, after 9 layers, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29,524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29,524. Let me compute that.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to compute 29,524 * 3 is to break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach to compute the entire expression without expanding each layer. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn our case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is known. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think again. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. So, in our problem, the first term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. So, maybe we can adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each layer is a term in the sequence. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9 = 29,524. So, perhaps the formula can help us compute a_9 directly.\n\nThe general solution for a_n when a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 is undefined or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it starting from a_0.\n\nWait, let's see. If we take a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, in terms of the formula, if we take n starting from 1, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe closed-form solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = (c/(r - 1)) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n - 1}\n\nPlugging in c=1, r=3, and a_1=4:\n\na_n = (1/(3 - 1)) + (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n - 1}\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (1/2) + (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n - 1}\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = 1/2 + (7/2) * 3^{n - 1}\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = 1/2 + (7/2)*3^{0} = 1/2 + 7/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = 1/2 + (7/2)*3^{1} = 1/2 + 21/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had a_2 = 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the formula. Let me check the standard solution for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach for solving a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is k - r = 0, so k = r. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*r^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nP = r*P + c\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - r*P = c => P*(1 - r) = c => P = c/(1 - r)\n\nWait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, so it's a_n - r*a_{n-1} = c.\n\nSo, the particular solution would be P = c/(1 - r), but since r > 1, it's c/(1 - r) = -c/(r - 1).\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = homogeneous + particular = A*r^n + (-c)/(r - 1)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say we have a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*r^1 + (-c)/(r - 1) = A*r - c/(r - 1) = 4\n\nPlugging in r=3 and c=1:\n\nA*3 - 1/(3 - 1) = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that matches our earlier computations. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524, and then we multiply that by 3 as per the original problem.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if the formula applies correctly here. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've modeled that correctly, and the formula gives us the correct a_n for n=1 to n=3, which we verified, so it's safe to use it for n=9.\n\nThus, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it another way to confirm. Let me compute each layer using the formula.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression by expanding each term step by step, but that would take a lot of time. Since I've verified it with both iterative computation and the formula, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3, we get 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3. So, after 9 layers, the value is already in the tens of thousands, which is why the final result is over 88,000.\n\nI think I'm confident enough that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nAfter computing all layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 again. Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer becomes 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So that layer is 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, so that's 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121). That would be 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's getting big. Let's keep going: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wow, okay, this is increasing rapidly. Next, moving out: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Hmm, 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wow, that's a big number. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wow, okay. So now, going back to the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Wait, let me make sure I'm tracking correctly. Let me recount the layers because I think I might have miscounted. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4. Then, each time, we have a layer that's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's see how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the first 3, then inside it, we have 1+3(...), and each time it's nested. Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. From the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3*(...). So, let's count how many 1+3(...) expressions there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, starting with 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3, then each time another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. The first 3 is at the beginning. Then, inside it, we have 1+3(...). Each time, that inner 3 is followed by another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions. Let's see: the first 3 is followed by 1+3(...). Then, inside that, another 3(...), and so on, until we get to the innermost 1+3. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then, each time, moving outwards, we have another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 layer, then each time we add a layer, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with )))))))) So, how many closing parentheses are there? Let me count: after the innermost 1+3, each layer adds a closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time moving out, adding another closing parenthesis. Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the innermost 1+3, each layer adds a closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, how many closing parentheses are there after the innermost? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then moving out, each time we have another closing parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3(...)), then 1+3(...))), and so on, until the outermost 3(...) which ends with )))))))) So, counting the number of closing parentheses at the end: starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, let's count: starting from the innermost, the first closing parenthesis is after 1+3, then each layer adds another. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3(...)), which adds one more, so total of two. Then, moving out, each layer adds another, so let's see how many there are at the end. The expression ends with )))))))) So, that's 8 closing parentheses. So, that means there are 8 layers. Wait, but starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each additional closing parenthesis adds another layer. So, if there are 8 closing parentheses, that means 8 layers? Wait, but the innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer. Then each additional closing parenthesis adds another layer. So, if there are 8 closing parentheses, that means 8 layers? Wait, but let me check. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, let's count the number of layers. Let me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 3*(Layer8)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the expression step by step, keeping track of each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3\n\nAnd so on, until L9, because the expression has 9 layers of nesting.\n\nWait, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's L1.\n\nThen, each time moving out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let's count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, which is L1.\n\nThen, each time we have another layer, so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, L1 to L9, and then the outermost 3*(L9). So, total layers: 9 inner layers plus the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I thought I had 8 layers, but now I'm seeing 9. Maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me try to count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nEach time, we add another layer. Let's see how many times this happens. The expression ends with )))))))) which is 8 closing parentheses. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is enclosed in one pair of parentheses. Then, each additional layer adds another pair. So, if there are 8 closing parentheses, that means 8 layers beyond the innermost. Wait, no. Each layer adds one closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's enclosed in one pair of parentheses. Then, each time we add another layer, we add another pair, so the total number of closing parentheses would be equal to the number of layers. So, if the expression ends with 8 closing parentheses, that means there are 8 layers beyond the innermost. Wait, but that can't be because the innermost is already one layer. So, total layers would be 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, we've worked our way out to the outermost layer, which is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers beyond the innermost, making it 10 layers in total? No, wait, the innermost is 1 layer, then each additional layer adds one more, so if I have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), that would be layers 1 through 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I did the counting earlier, I ended up with 88573 as the value before multiplying by 3. So, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers step by step, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 being 29524, but then I thought there was another layer. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 occurs as a separate term. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nEach time, we add another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term, which seems to be 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear as a separate term? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time, moving out, another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each 1+3 is a new layer, and there are 9 instances of 1+3 before the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 layers leading up to 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. But in my initial calculation, I went up to 88573 before multiplying by 3. So, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me try again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier counting.\n\nWait, let me check: 3*(29524) is 88572, not 265,719 as I thought earlier. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, but when I initially did the layers, I went up to Layer9 being 88573, but that must be incorrect because the number of layers is actually 9, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 occurs as a separate term inside the parentheses. Each time, we have 1+3 followed by another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then, each time we add another layer, so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, moving out, we have 1+3*(1+3).\n\n- Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n\n- And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the number of closing parentheses at the end is 8. So, perhaps the number of layers is 8 beyond the innermost, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me parse the expression step by step, keeping track of each layer.\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work my way out, writing down each step.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but the expression only has 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is 1+3, and then each time we add another 1+3*(...), so that's 8 more layers, making it 9 in total. So, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would make the final result 265,719. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term inside the parentheses.\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, moving out, we have 1+3*(1+3).\n\n- Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n\n- Continuing this way, each time adding another 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3 appear as a separate term? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. So, the expression has 9 instances of 1+3 before the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the closing parentheses at the end, there are 8. So, perhaps the number of layers is 8 beyond the innermost, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think differently. Let me consider that each 1+3 is a separate layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would be 3*88573 = 265,719. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of layers again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3 =4.\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=13.\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*(Layer3)=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*(Layer4)=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*(Layer5)=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*(Layer6)=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*(Layer7)=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*(Layer8)=29524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that would be the final result.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I went up to 88573 before multiplying by 3, which was incorrect because I had 9 layers, not 10.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would have been incorrect because I had 9 layers, not 10.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, if we denote L_n as the nth layer, then:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can find A and B using the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, substituting into the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the expression 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After computing all nine layers, the ninth layer yields 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next part. Let me see: innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each subsequent term is another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. After the first 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Because each time it's a new set of parentheses. Wait, actually, when I look at it, the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. Let me see: the innermost is (1+3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(that result), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, perhaps there are nine layers of nesting. Let me check: Starting from the innermost, (1+3) is layer 1. Then each time we add another layer, so the next one is 1 + 3*(layer1), that's layer2. Then layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, maybe the way to solve this is to compute each layer starting from layer1 up to layer9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that's if I break it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, 29524 * 3 would be:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer's computation because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 =1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing up to layer9 as 29524, we multiply by 3, which gives 88572.\n\nIs there a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer? Because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1\n\nSo, B= -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4\n\nSo, 3A -1/2=4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A=4 +1/2=9/2\n\nSo, A=(9/2)/3= (9/2)*(1/3)=3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer9, a_9=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By defining each layer and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe it's 9 layers? Because each time I see a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)). Let me check: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then that's inside another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until we have 9 layers. So, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... 9 times ... ))). So, to solve this, I think I need to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let me define each layer as follows: Let me denote each nested expression starting from the innermost as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2. And so on, until E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so actually, each E is 1 + 3*E_previous. So, let me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting with E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*E9.\n\nSo, the total value would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each E step by step again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions because this seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^{n} * E0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where E0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, E1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, let's adjust the indices. Let me define E1 as the first term, so E1 = 4, E2 = 13, etc., up to E9 = 29524.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, for n >= 2, with E1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Because when I started, I thought there were 9 layers, but let me count again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is inside one 3(...), then that's inside another 3(...), and so on until the outermost. Let me see: Each time I have a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so:\n\n3( ... ) where inside is 1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times 3( occurs after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then inside that is another 3(, and so on. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, so maybe the count is 9 layers? Or 8? Let me see.\n\nWait, in the expression, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time you go out, you have a 3(1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3(, each time there's a 1+3(...), so how many times does 3( occur?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- The first 3( is after the initial 3.\n- Then inside that, another 3(.\n- So, each time I enter a new layer, I have another 3(.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3)\n\nWait, but the last one is 3(1+3 without a closing parenthesis yet. Wait, no, the innermost is 1+3, so perhaps the number of layers is 8? Because each time you have a 3(, except the last one which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3( after the initial 3.\n\nEach 3( is a new layer, so:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, but the last one is 3(1+3) without another 3( after that. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Because each 3( adds a new layer, and the innermost is 1+3, so from the outermost to innermost, it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed E9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But when I used the formula, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9, because in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from 1+3, that's layer 1, then 1+3*(layer1) is layer2, up to layer9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(1+3*(...)), so that would be layer10? Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the initial 3 is outside of that, so the total layers inside the initial 3 are 9, making the total expression have 10 layers? Wait, no, because each 3*(...) adds a layer. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better not to get confused with the layers and just stick with the step-by-step calculation I did earlier, which gave me 88572, and the formula also confirms that. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating the count of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4.\n\nSo, E2=1+3*4=13, E3=1+3*13=40, etc., as before.\n\nAlternatively, the formula I derived earlier is E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing each E step by step, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nE1=1+3=4\n\nE2=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nE3=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nE4=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nE5=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nE6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nE7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nE8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nE9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, E9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum.\n\nWait, each time you have 1 + 3*something, so maybe it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with 9 layers of 3* inside.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both give me the same result, so I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these calculations and double-checking, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nWe define each nested expression starting from the innermost as \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9\\), where each \\(E_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_{n-1}\\).\n\n1. \\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot E_9\\).

    "text": " Hmm, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a similar expression. Let me try to parse this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, let me check: the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost result)). Since the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, the previous result was 13, so this layer would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Wait, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the new result. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost as 1, then each subsequent layer adds another step. Let me see: the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3*(...), so maybe I need to compute it nine times? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one. Then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers inside is nine? Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then each layer outwards adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, let's list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each adding another (1 + 3*...), so that would be 9 steps, and then the outermost 3 times that result. So, let's compute each step:\n\n1. Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Step 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Step 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Step 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Step 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Step 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Step 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Step 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Step 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Now, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524. 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again, just to be sure.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1,093). 3*1,093 is 3,279, so 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3,280). 3*3,280 is 9,840, so 1 + 9,840 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9,841). 3*9,841 is 29,523, so 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 times 29,524. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just think again: each step, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, right? So, starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3*previous. So, after 9 steps, I get 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Because computing each step manually might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, there are only nine layers, so it's manageable.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that would be helpful. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The equation is a_{n+1} - 3*a_n = 1. The homogeneous part is a_{n+1} - 3*a_n = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed a_9 directly as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut since I was computing each step manually, it's good that I arrived at the same result using both methods.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, counting the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections, I think there are nine of them, each time going outward. So, a_1 to a_9, as I computed earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the expression has nine levels of nesting, each with a (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer, so nine steps, leading to a_9, and then the outermost 3*a_9.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) once again:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524:\n\nCompute 3 \u00d7 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 \u00d7 9,000 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n3 \u00d7 24 = 72 \u2192 Total: 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n24 \u00d7 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, so that seems to confirm it again. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...) parts. Each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times that occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is one, then each layer out adds one more. So, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, after the initial 3, there are nine (1 + 3(...)) terms, each nested within the previous one. So, that would mean that there are nine layers, each adding a new (1 + 3*(...)), so that's nine steps, as I computed earlier.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Therefore, a_9 is 29,524, and the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is then computed as:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, each time there's a 1+3, and then it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 again. Let me try to parse it step by step. Maybe I can represent each layer as a separate step. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, since there are nine layers of nesting. Wait, actually, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me try to count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that would mean nine layers? Wait, no, actually, each time you have a (1+3(...)), so let's see: the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(innermost)), and so on, until you reach the outermost 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. From the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3) = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each other. Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, let's see: the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(...)), so each layer is one more 1+3. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times 1+3 appears. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out is another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: the expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, but each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Wait, actually, let me parse it correctly. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions. Let me list them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(innermost)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*(1+3)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)))) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))))) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6.

(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, that's nine layers. So after the innermost, each step out adds another layer, and we have nine layers in total. So the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount. Let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time you have a 1+3, then another 1+3(...), etc. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\nThen each step out adds another 1+3*(...). So, let's see how many times this happens. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times? Wait, no. Let me see: each (1+3) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, then each step out is another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out is another (1+3(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. So, layer 1: 4, layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have (1 + 3*(innermost)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, after nine layers, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Now, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to solve it using this method.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly without calculating each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step wasn't too bad.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches layer 2.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should count how many times this nesting happens. Let me see: Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3( ... ), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let me see: Each time we add a layer, we go one step up. So starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The entire expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe I can write it as 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... ))), with each layer having another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Wait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start by computing the innermost expression and then work my way outward. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer gives us 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that's 40. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121. Wait, that's 11 squared, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, moving on: next layer is 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, moving to the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Now, moving to the next layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, actually, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now, adding these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. Now, moving to the outermost layer, which is 3 times that result. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Now, adding these together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, the final result is 797,160. Wait, let me verify that I did all those multiplications correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n12. Finally, the outermost: 3*265720 = 797,160.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step I computed 3 times the previous result and added 1. So, 12 layers in total, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the outermost 3 times that. So, yes, 797,160 is the result. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each inner 1+3 is another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms inside each other. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 +\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: that's one layer.\n- Then, moving out, the next is 1+3*(previous result): that's the second layer.\n- Each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check: starting from the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each time we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3: that's one.\n2. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: from the innermost to the outermost, each layer adds one more 1+3. So, starting from 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. The number of layers would be equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(...)) : 1\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) : 2\n- Continuing, each time we have another 3(...), so how many times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. Wait, no, let me count them:\n\nEach time we have a (1 + 3(...)), which opens a new parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2: 3(1 + ... So that's 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another ( at position 5: 3(1 + 3(...)) So that's 2.\n\nContinuing, each time we have a new ( after 3. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) -> 1\n2. Inside, 3(1 + 3(...) -> 2\n3. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 3\n4. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 4\n5. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 5\n6. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 6\n7. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 7\n8. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 8\n9. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 9\n10. Next: 3(1 + 3(...) -> 10\n\nWait, but the expression seems to have 9 layers, not 10. Let me recount the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the initial 3, each (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times we have 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\n1. The first layer: 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) => 2\n3. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>3\n4. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>4\n5. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>5\n6. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>6\n7. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>7\n8. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>8\n9. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) =>9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, I think I did 9 layers, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 12 layers, which seems incorrect. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me check again. Each time I computed a layer, I was moving one step out, so if there are 9 layers, I should have 9 computations. But in my initial computation, I went up to 12 layers, which is more than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but in my initial computation, I had 12 layers. So, I think I overcounted the layers earlier. Let me recount the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms:\n\n1. The innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears as a nested term.\n\nLet me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then, each layer out adds another 1 + 3(...). So, in the expression, how many times does 1 + 3 occur inside another 1 + 3(...)?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n10. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time there's a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)) => 1\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) => 2\n3. Inside that, another => 3\n4. =>4\n5. =>5\n6. =>6\n7. =>7\n8. =>8\n9. =>9\n10. =>10\n\nWait, but the expression seems to end after the 10th opening parenthesis. So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I should compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, let's compute again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial computation where I ended up with 797,160. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier. So, if there are 9 layers, the result should be 88,572. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears:\n\n1. The innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, now I'm seeing that there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we get 29524, then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I went up to 12 layers, which gave me 797,160, but that must be incorrect because the expression only has 9 layers. So, I think the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm by another method. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's compute a few terms:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but when I first computed, I had 12 layers, which gave me a different result. So, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time we have a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) => 1\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) => 2\n3. Inside that, another =>3\n4. =>4\n5. =>5\n6. =>6\n7. =>7\n8. =>8\n9. =>9\n10. =>10\n\nWait, but the expression ends after 10 opening parentheses. So, perhaps there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, no, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, if there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) =>1\n2. (1 + 3(...)) =>2\n3. (1 + 3(...)) =>3\n4. (1 + 3(...)) =>4\n5. (1 + 3(...)) =>5\n6. (1 + 3(...)) =>6\n7. (1 + 3(...)) =>7\n8. (1 + 3(...)) =>8\n9. (1 + 3(...)) =>9\n10. (1 + 3(...)) =>10\n\nWait, but the expression seems to end after the 10th opening parenthesis. So, perhaps there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, no, because each ( corresponds to a new layer. So, 10 opening parentheses would mean 10 layers, but that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears in the expression. Each time it's a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 1 + 3 terms. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Therefore, there are 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we get 29524, then the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought I had 12 layers, but now I'm seeing that it's 9 layers. So, I must have miscounted earlier. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the number of layers, which led me to an incorrect result. But by using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I can count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, right? So maybe I can compute that first and work my way outward. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So now, that part simplifies to 13. Next, moving out another layer, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that simplifies to 40. Let me keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So that's 121. Next, 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. That's 364. Continuing outward, next is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093. Well, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So now, that's 3280. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's 29524. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, maybe that's too broken down. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So that's 88573. Now, the next layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So that's 265720. Next layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, maybe that's too broken down. Alternatively, 265720*3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. So that's 797161. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute 3*797161. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 797161*3 directly. 700000*3=2,100,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 7,000*3=21,000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding all together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484. So that's 2,391,484. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute that. 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 391,484*3: let's compute 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2,391,484*3 directly. Let's do that: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Wait, no, 2,391,484 is 2,000,000 + 391,484. So, 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, and 391,484*3. Let's compute 391,484*3: 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Wait, but 391,484 is 300,000 + 90,000 + 1,000 + 400 + 80 + 4. So, adding up each part: 300,000*3=900,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 1,000*3=3,000; 400*3=1,200; 80*3=240; 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 900,000 + 270,000 = 1,170,000; 1,170,000 + 3,000 = 1,173,000; 1,173,000 + 1,200 = 1,174,200; 1,174,200 + 240 = 1,174,440; 1,174,440 + 12 = 1,174,452. So, 391,484*3=1,174,452. Now, adding that to 6,000,000: 6,000,000 + 1,174,452 = 7,174,452. So, 3*(2,391,484) = 7,174,452. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 7,174,452. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each step multiplied by 3 and adding 1. So, 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 1+3*29524=88573, then 1+3*88573=265720, then 1+3*265720=797161, then 1+3*797161=2391484, and finally 3*2391484=7174452. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, when I multiply by 3 and add 1, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 7,174,452. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any calculation errors in my steps, so I'm confident that this is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{7174452}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the outermost, each time I see a 3 followed by a parenthesis. So, let's see: 1. 3(...) 2. Then inside that, another 3(...) 3. And another... I think there are nine sets of parentheses in total. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another level. So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outwards. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check: The very last part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then moving one level out, that 4 is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Then, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving to the next outer layer. Let me try to formalize this. Let's define each layer as a term where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote the innermost term as a base case and then build up. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. Wait, actually, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s after each parenthesis. Each time, after a \"(\", there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times 3 is used inside the parentheses. From the innermost to the outermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but then the outermost layer is 3*(layer9). So, after computing layer9, we have to multiply by 3. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer1 as 4, then layer2 as 13, layer3 as 40, and so on up to layer9, and then finally multiply by 3 to get the total. Let me write this out step by step to avoid confusion.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers or the multiplication.\n\nStarting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 3(...), so:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost expression, which is 3 times that.\n\nSo, how many layers? Each time we have a \"1+3(\" before another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3( L1 ), where L1 is 1+3( L2 ), and so on until L9 is 1+3.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost 3*(L9). So, yes, 9 layers, which I correctly computed from Layer1 to Layer9.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, layer9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nThe expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded recursively.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Hmm, maybe not exactly a geometric series, but perhaps we can adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already found the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, and it matches our step-by-step computation, I think that's sufficient.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The innermost term is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me count how many times the \"1+3(...)\" part occurs. Starting from the innermost part, each time I solve a parenthesis, I move one step out. Let's see, the innermost part is \"1+3\", then the next one is \"1+3(1+3)\", and so on. I think there are nine sets of parentheses here because I count nine opening parentheses before the last \"1+3\". Wait, maybe I should just start evaluating it step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, this seems to be getting bigger each time. Let me keep going.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Adding 1 gives us 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. Breaking it down: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Adding 1 gives us 265720.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3 times the previous result. So, 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 265720 times 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n265720\n\u00d7       3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n0*3=0\n2*3=6\n7*3=21, write down 1 and carry over 2\n5*3=15 plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1\n6*3=18 plus 1 is 19, write down 9 and carry over 1\n2*3=6 plus 1 is 7\nSo, writing it down: 797160. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step was:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=88573\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=265720\n12. Finally: 3*265720=797160\n\nWait, so each time I was moving out a layer, I was computing the next part. So, starting from the innermost, which was the first \"1+3\", and then each subsequent layer added another 1+3*(previous result). So, in total, how many layers did I compute? Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n12. 3*265720=797160\n\nWait, that seems like 12 steps, but the original expression had 9 layers of parentheses. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of times \"1+3(...)\" occurs. Let me parse it:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses before the last \"1+3\". Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers. Wait, but when I did the steps, I ended up with 12 steps, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each \"1+3(...)\" as a layer, and then the outermost 3*(...) is another step. Let me try to recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*(layer2)=1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*(layer3)=1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*(layer4)=1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*(layer5)=1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*(layer6)=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*(layer7)=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*(layer8)=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572. Wait, but earlier I went further. Hmm, maybe I confused the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the total number of layers inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9 layers of \"1+3*(...)\". So, that would mean:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*(layer1)=1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*(layer2)=1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*(layer3)=1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*(layer4)=1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*(layer5)=1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*(layer6)=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*(layer7)=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*(layer8)=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing, I went beyond that, which suggests I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how the expression is structured. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each \"1+3*(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, let's compute each layer correctly.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's only 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the final result is 88572. But earlier, when I was computing, I went up to 3*265720, which was 797160. So, I must have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me parse the original expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the last \"1+3\".\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the expression has 9 layers of \"1+3\", each nested inside the previous. So, the innermost is layer 1:1+3=4.\n\nThen, layer 2:1 + 3*(layer1)=13.\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*(layer2)=40.\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*(layer3)=121.\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*(layer4)=364.\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*(layer5)=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*(layer6)=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*(layer7)=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*(layer8)=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, perhaps earlier I continued beyond layer9, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, but when I first started computing, I went up to 1+3*(265720)=797160, which would be if there were more layers. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression has more layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count each \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 \"1+3(\" layers, meaning that the innermost is layer1:1+3=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, layer9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, layer1:4\n\nlayer2:13\n\nlayer3:40\n\nlayer4:121\n\nlayer5:364\n\nlayer6:1093\n\nlayer7:3280\n\nlayer8:9841\n\nlayer9:29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to 3*265720, I think I was adding more layers than actually exist. So, perhaps the correct answer is 88572, not 797160.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me parse the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, layer1:4\n\nlayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nlayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nlayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nlayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nlayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nlayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 12 layers, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, to confirm, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them, so layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me check the computation for layer9 again to make sure.\n\nlayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, layer9:1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdd them up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*265720, which was 797160, but that must have been incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it again step by step to make sure.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 12 layers, but that must have been a mistake. So, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier computation. So, the closed-form solution confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to find a closed-form solution, confirming the result. \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
