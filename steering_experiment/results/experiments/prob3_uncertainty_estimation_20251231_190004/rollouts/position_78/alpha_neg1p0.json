Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something else. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1=1+12=13, L3=1+3*L2=1+39=40, and so on. So each term is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. Given L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer9: (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.

    "text": " Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. It might be possible to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total sum can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about it. Starting from the innermost term, each layer adds another 3 times the previous term. So, the entire expression can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous one, but with an additional 1 added each time. Hmm, maybe not exactly a standard geometric series, but perhaps it can be expressed in terms of a sum. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, let me think differently. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But that seems recursive because the inner part is similar to S. Wait, no, because each layer is similar but not exactly the same. Alternatively, maybe I can express S in terms of itself, but I think that might complicate things. Since we've already computed it step by step and confirmed with a formula, perhaps that's sufficient. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and even considering a possible geometric series approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But wait, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). Hmm, perhaps it's a finite geometric series with 9 layers. Wait, in the problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the first 3(...), each inner part is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, so 9 layers. So, it's a finite geometric series with 9 terms, perhaps. Wait, but each term is 3 times something. Let me think differently. Let me define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, as I computed earlier, a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. For example, a_5 should be (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Which matches what I had before. a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. So, perhaps this is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me consider that.\n\nIf I denote the nth layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as before. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for each layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.

So each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try computing it in another way to confirm. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or a pattern that can be represented by a formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially in the exponentiation part, I'll verify 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 is indeed 29524, and 29524*3 is 88572. Alright, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_p + L_n^{(h)} = -1/2 + C*3^n. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1 => 4 = -1/2 + 3C => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series or something, but given that each term is built on the previous one, the recurrence relation approach seems appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is the innermost term, which is 4, then a_2=1+3*4=13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be seen as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... up to a certain power. Wait, let me think. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds another power of 3. Let's try expanding it: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Continuing this way, each layer adds another term which is 3^k where k increases by 1 each time. So, after 9 layers, the expression inside would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, because each layer adds a new power. Wait, let me check: Starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. That's 3^0 + 3^1. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds another term, so after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/ (3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's a_8, not a_9. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Each layer n corresponds to a sum from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k. So, for layer 1: sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k = 1. But in our case, layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Wait, maybe my initial assumption is off. Let me try again. Each time we go out a layer, we add another power of 3. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer n corresponds to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, no, because layer 1 is sum up to 3^1, layer 2 up to 3^2, etc. So, layer m corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=m of 3^k. Therefore, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. But wait, in our problem, the expression has 9 layers, starting from the innermost as 1 + 3, so perhaps it's up to 3^8. Let me check: If layer 1 is sum up to 3^1, layer 2 up to 3^2, then layer 9 would be sum up to 3^9. But in our earlier computation, a_9 was 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's the sum up to 3^9, because the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, that matches. Therefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result. So, that's another way to approach it, recognizing it as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same result. So, I think that's solid. Just to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, layer 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches our manual calculation. Similarly, layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 =729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe we can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's take Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)=1 + 3*40=121. Then Layer5=1 + 3*121=364. Layer6=1 + 3*364=1093. Layer7=1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer8=1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer9=1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, perhaps the total expression can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write it as a sum: Each time, the 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers it's nested in. So, starting from the innermost 1, it's multiplied by 3^8, because there are 8 layers above it. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. Wait, but actually, the structure is such that each 1 is part of a term that's multiplied by 3 each time you go up a layer. Let me try to visualize this. Let me denote S as the entire expression. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express S as a sum. Let me think recursively. Let S_n be the expression with n layers. Then S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}). So, S_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Wait, but earlier, when we had Layer1=4, then Layer2=13, etc. Wait, perhaps S_n is the entire expression with n layers. So, for n=1, it's 3*(1 + 3)=12. For n=2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. For n=3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))=3*(1 + 3*13)=3*40=120. Wait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so S_9. Using the recurrence S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}), with S_1=12. Let's compute S_n step by step: S_1=3*(1 + 3)=12. S_2=3*(1 + S_1)=3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. S_3=3*(1 + S_2)=3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120. S_4=3*(1 + 120)=3*121=363. S_5=3*(1 + 363)=3*364=1092. S_6=3*(1 + 1092)=3*1093=3279. S_7=3*(1 + 3279)=3*3280=9840. S_8=3*(1 + 9840)=3*9841=29523. S_9=3*(1 + 29523)=3*29524=88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, using this approach, S_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then S_9=3*a_9=88572. So, both methods confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure, where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a recursive relation. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the layers again using the formula: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2=4, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40, L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=121, L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=364, L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093, L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280, L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.

Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nHmm, let me see if these numbers relate to powers of 3 or something similar.\n\nLooking at Layer1:4=3+1\n\nLayer2:13=3*4 +1=12+1=13\n\nLayer3:40=3*13 +1=39+1=40\n\nLayer4:121=3*40 +1=120+1=121\n\nLayer5:364=3*121 +1=363+1=364\n\nLayer6:1093=3*364 +1=1092+1=1093\n\nLayer7:3280=3*1093 +1=3279+1=3280\n\nLayer8:9841=3*3280 +1=9840+1=9841\n\nLayer9:29524=3*9841 +1=29523+1=29524\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with Layer1: n=1, a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 would be a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a method, either way is fine, but computing step by step is more straightforward for someone just starting out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is followed by \"3(...)\", and each time, another layer is added. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, which is the first 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. So, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each time you go out a layer, you add another 3(...). So, starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, or perhaps find a pattern or formula to compute it without having to compute each layer manually. Wait, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants to be determined. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 +1/2 =3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time or reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 =29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I still get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recursion is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and each subsequent layer goes up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had more layers, I could compute it using the formula, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence helped me find a formula, which could be useful if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, step-by-step computation worked just fine. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Each step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous term. Specifically, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is Layer 2. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier inside each term. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers.

So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L0 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution can be found using the method for solving such recursions. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3*r, which is trivial, but perhaps I should use the standard method. The general solution for Ln is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp. Substituting into the recurrence relation: Lp = 3*Lp + 1. Solving for Lp: Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative fraction. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps it's correct. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 0, L0 = 1. Plugging into the general solution: 1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we've already computed. For n = 1: L1 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n = 9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the result without having to go through each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, which gives the same result. 4. Multiply the final layer by 3 to get the overall result. 5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy. So, after all these steps, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me try to solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers increases. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution can be found by expanding the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = ... = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1. Wait, but a_1 is 4, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k} + 3^{n}*(a_1 - 1). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me try to solve it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, the layers correspond to a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, where a_9 is the innermost part, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the innermost expression. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, to find a formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_p + a_n^h = -1/2 + C*3^n. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = -1/2 + (3^{2})/2 = -1/2 + 9/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = -1/2 + (3^3)/2 = -1/2 + 27/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = -1/2 + (3^4)/2 = -1/2 +81/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern of a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try to see what L_n looks like for each n. We have L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, this seems familiar. Wait a second, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. These numbers look like they're related to powers of 3 or something. Let me see: 3^0 = 1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Hmm, not directly matching. Wait, but 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 12 +1, which is 3*4 +1, 40 is 39 +1, which is 3*13 +1, so yes, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall, for a recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant if a \u2260 1. Let me solve it properly.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a geometric progression. But in this case, since it's multiplied by 3 each time and added 1, the formula approach was more straightforward.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation also gives the same result. So, yeah, that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. **Layer 2**: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. **Layer 3**: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. **Layer 4**: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. **Layer 5**: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. **Layer 6**: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. **Layer 7**: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. **Layer 8**: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. **Layer 9**: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, but let me cross-verify this because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I thought that was the innermost layer, but actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; total 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. Let me confirm 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. But wait, 29524 has digits 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplied by 3, as I did earlier, it's 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, I can compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but given the small number of layers (only 9), computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. However, if there were more layers, I might consider a formula for the sum. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Also correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which adds confidence to the answer. Alternatively, I can also compute 3^{10} directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So yes, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is by recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which can be seen as a geometric series with ratio 3. However, since each term is defined recursively, it's more straightforward to model it as a linear recurrence relation, which we did earlier.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3.

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere along the way. The recurrence relation approach seems solid, and it led me to the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it down: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can simplify the computation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
