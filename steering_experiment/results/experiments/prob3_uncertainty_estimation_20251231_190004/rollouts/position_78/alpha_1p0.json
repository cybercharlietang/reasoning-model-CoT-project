    "text": " Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of them. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, it's like a nested multiplication. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can compute each a_n step by step as I did earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. This seems consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation.

    "text": " Let me just double-check my steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers: Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to see if there's a shortcut. Let me think about the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))). This is a recursive expression. Maybe I can model it with a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find C. If the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C, we can solve for C: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, this seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents without computing each layer. Let me think. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing a_9 more efficiently. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if it matches. Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works for the initial layers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for a_9 as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively calculating each layer, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the nth layer, confirming the result.

Hmm, but wait a second, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... Continuing until the outermost. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, and each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 +3, then the next layer is 1 +3*(innermost), then next is 1 +3*(previous), etc. How many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after 3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let's see: The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which itself is followed by another (1+3(...)), etc. So, starting from the innermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of times we see \"1+3(\" in the expression. From the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, it seems there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3 =4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 =4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a geometric series. Let me see: a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which is 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +... +3^{n-1}. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's more like a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. But from the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which is the same as the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum of the first n+1 terms of a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 3 is indeed (3^{n+1}-1)/(3-1)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which matches our formula. So, a_n is the sum of 1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n}. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=1 +3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561 +19683. Let me compute that: 1 +3=4; 4+9=13; 13+27=40; 40+81=121; 121+243=364; 364+729=1093; 1093+2187=3280; 3280+6561=9841; 9841+19683=29524. Yes, that's the same as a_9=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but perhaps I can recognize it as a geometric series. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.

Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this more quickly, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if I can spot a pattern in the numbers: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form formula for the nth term, we find the value at the outermost layer and multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9. Maybe this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me assume that the steady-state solution is a constant c. So, c = 1 + 3*c => c - 3c = 1 => -2c = 1 => c = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is of the form A*3^n. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. The formula I derived earlier using recurrence relations gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. Maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if the expression had only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Then, 3*a_2 = 39. Which is correct. So, the formula works for smaller numbers, which gives me more confidence. Similarly, for three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Using the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that for nine layers, the result is 88572. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula for the nth layer, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem with nine layers, the innermost value is computed step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then, each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk. The recurrence relation is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. First, find the homogeneous solution: Lk - 3*Lk-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1. So, the homogeneous solution would be Lk^(h) = C*3^k. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say Lk^(p) = D. Substituting into the equation: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For k=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Lk = (3^(k+1) -1)/2. So, for k=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. ... L9 = 1 + 3*L8. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a recursive relation. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's try to compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. L1 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence would be L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost part as A: A = 1 + 3. Then, moving one layer out, B =1 + 3*A. Then, C=1 +3*B, and so on, up to the outermost layer. But I think that's similar to what I did before. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are nine layers, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum. Wait, let me see. Let me define S as the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses, so S =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*S. But S itself is 1 + 3*T, where T is the next inner expression, which is 1 +3*U, etc., down to the innermost layer. But since there are nine layers, perhaps I can write S in terms of itself, but I don't think that would work because each layer is different. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, L(9)=29524, so 3*L(9)=88572. Therefore, I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can simplify the expression. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. Using this recursive approach, we compute each layer's value sequentially. After calculating the innermost layers, we find that each subsequent layer builds on the previous one, leading us to the final value of the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute from Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Calculation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one manually isn't too bad. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is L(n) = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs, which would correspond to the number of layers. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the first after the initial 3, there's 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\" because each time you enter a new parenthesis. So, layers 1 through 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, my initial calculation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find A and B by using the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nFirst, plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nThen, for n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. On the other hand, using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plugging A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the total expression is a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*...*3*1, where the number of 3s increases with each term.\n\nWait, but actually, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the number of terms is limited by the number of layers, which is 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each time you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so when you expand it, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, because each layer is one more multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let's consider the expansion:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nBut perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we have L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and recognizing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. But let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, in general, for such a nested expression, if we have n layers, the value can be expressed recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=1, f(1)=4. For n=2, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13. For n=3, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40. And so on, up to n=9, which would be f(9)=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's try to solve the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, where n starts at 1, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also think of this as each layer being a term in a geometric progression, but the way it's nested makes it a bit different. However, since we've verified it both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence relation, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 =1 +3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln -3*Ln-1=1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln -3*Ln-1=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P =1 +3*P => P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1=4. So, when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, L9= (3^(10)-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049, so L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 without computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation.\n\nThe nonhomogeneous term is 1, which is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a geometric progression. So, perhaps I can model it as such.\n\nWait, let me try another approach: expanding the expression step by step without using the recurrence relation.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after computing up to the ninth layer, we have 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each step more systematically, writing down each result as I go along.\n\nLet me list each layer with its corresponding computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned about whether I missed a layer or counted incorrectly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which after computation gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding it algebraically. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define E_n as the expression at the nth layer. So,\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are nine layers, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, earlier we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is added inside the parentheses. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, but it's more complicated because each term is nested within the previous one. So, perhaps the geometric series approach isn't directly applicable here, but the recurrence relation approach works better.\n\nIn any case, through multiple methods, I arrived at the same result: 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then moving out one layer: 1+3*(4)=1+12=13. Next layer:1+3*(13)=1+39=40. Next:1+3*40=1+120=121. Then:1+3*121=1+363=364. Next:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Then:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Then:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, this recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression, but since it's only 9 terms, computing step by step is manageable. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form to verify. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4.5 => C=1.5. So a_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5. Let me compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = 1.5*3^9 - 0.5. Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So a_9 = 1.5*19683 - 0.5 = (19683*1.5) - 0.5. Compute 19683*1.5: 19683 * 1 =19683, 19683 *0.5=9841.5. So total is 19683 + 9841.5=29524.5. Then subtract 0.5: 29524.5 - 0.5=29524. Which matches our earlier result. So a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one correctly, and the closed-form solution also gives the same result. So I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Alternatively, maybe using a formula for geometric series or something, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 3^11 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 3*3 =9\n\n3^3 =9*3=27\n\n3^4=27*3=81\n\n3^5=81*3=243\n\n3^6=243*3=729\n\n3^7=729*3=2187\n\n3^8=2187*3=6561\n\n3^9=6561*3=19683\n\n3^10=19683*3=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed each layer as I initially did, and I still got 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding all the terms, but that seems messy. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might be helpful, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a linear recurrence, which I already solved.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000=79048, +9000=88048, +524=88572. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, I think the final answer is indeed 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n be the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, as we've seen, each layer can be expressed as (3^(n+1) -1)/2, where n is the layer number. Since we have nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) where L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. So, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, this method also leads to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to write a general formula for the entire expression, which is 3*a_9, it would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is computed. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Now, I can see that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.

Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.

So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation approach, we find the solution to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Hmm, but let me check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me verify 29524 * 3 again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them up. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000=88048, +524=88572. Yes, same result. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps there's a general formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's list out the values we've computed: n | L_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a recursive formula that can express L_n in terms of L_{n-1}. From the problem, we can see that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it using standard techniques for linear recursions.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be found by assuming L_n^p = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L_2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute L_9 using the formula again:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added constant. But since we've already found a closed-form formula, I think that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps this is a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so it's a linear recurrence, not exactly a geometric series, but similar.\n\nIn any case, since we've already computed each layer step by step and confirmed with the formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 *3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when writing the digits, we start from the right. So, the digits are:\n\n- Units place: 2 (from 4*3=12)\n- Tens place: 7 (from 2*3=6 +1=7)\n- Hundreds place:5 (from 5*3=15)\n- Thousands place:8 (from 9*3=27 +1=28)\n- Ten-thousands place:8 (from 2*3=6 +2=8)\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 *3 another way. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n=20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since the layers are nested, the formula I derived seems appropriate.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when computing a_9: Since n=9, a_n = (3^{10} - 1)/2, because a_1 corresponds to n=1, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. So, yes, a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

    "text": " Let me just double-check my steps because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers: Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer3: 1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, a5=1+3*121=364, a6=1+3*364=1093, a7=1+3*1093=3280, a8=1+3*3280=9841, a9=1+3*9841=29524. So, that's 9 layers. So, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers inside the main 3*(...). Using the recursive formula and solving it, I found that the innermost layers compute up to 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous result, leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by expanding each layer. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, I think that's solid. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match. Let's check n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, confident that a_9=29524, and 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, a_9 is the value of the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 1 + 3*(previous total). So, starting from 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on. So, it's the same as the recurrence relation. Therefore, the formula applies, and the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (9 layers), computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is similar to a geometric series. Let me explore that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.

The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit different. Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} first and then compute the expression without breaking it down into layers. Let's see.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, that's a geometric series. Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see for n=1: a_1 = 4. According to the formula, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c -1). Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1. So, B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13. According to the formula: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, maybe the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's more like a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but each term also adds 1. So, the closed-form we derived earlier is the right approach. Therefore, I think the answer is correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the closed-form formula, I can conclude that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 88572, but I'm not entirely sure if I did all the layers correctly. Let me try computing the layers again, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each time, we're computing L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). Let me see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think: The expression inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, after expanding all the parentheses, it's like a geometric series where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 8, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of layers. Since there are nine layers, each adding a 1 and multiplying by 3, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1's. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step until we reach the outermost layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern, allowing us to derive a formula for the nth layer. Applying this formula to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be computed as L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^n -1)/(c -1), assuming c \u22601. In this case, c=3 and d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1). Wait, but in our case, a_1=4. So, perhaps the initial term is a_1=4, and each subsequent term is a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4. For n=2, a_2=1 +3*4=13. For n=3, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, in terms of n, the general formula would be a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let's check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=2/2=1. But a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} + something). Let me try to derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Let me see if these numbers correspond to a known sequence. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the recurrence. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\nContinuing this way, after expanding all the way to a_1, we get:\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1\nWait, but a_1=4, so:\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*4\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k = (3^n -1)/(3 -1) = (3^n -1)/2\nSo, a_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^n\n= (3^n -1 + 8*3^n)/2\n= (9*3^n -1)/2\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n(9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, but a_1=4. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers correctly. Since a_1=4, which is after the first expansion, maybe the formula should start from n=1. Let me try to express a_n in terms of n.\n\nGiven a_1=4, and a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nNow, let's see if these terms match any known formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} +1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^2 +1)/2=(9+1)/2=10/2=5, which is not 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, let's see: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc.\n\nWait, 4 is 3 +1, 13 is 3*4 +1, 40 is 3*13 +1, etc. So, perhaps each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Which is exactly the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 correctly gives the value of each layer.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is a_1=4, which matches (3^{2}-1)/2=8/2=4.\n\nSo, layer 9 would be a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which is what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I'm not making a mistake in the formula. The formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 gives the value of the nth layer. So, for layer 9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's try to expand this step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so n=9, giving a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Recognize that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times the ninth layer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
