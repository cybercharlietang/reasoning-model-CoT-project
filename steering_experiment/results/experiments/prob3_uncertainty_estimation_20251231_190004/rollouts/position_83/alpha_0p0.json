    "text": " Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check the number of layers. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out. Since the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3 times that. So, 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), so Layer 9 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1, etc., up to Layer 9, which is the innermost of the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. So, the computation seems accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k=1 is the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, yes, that's exactly what I computed earlier. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for L_k. Let's see. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_k^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula directly. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, yeah, 88572 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let's find B. Assume the particular solution is B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is a term in a geometric progression. The closed-form formula we derived earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. It's a geometric series with ratio 3, and 10 terms (from 3^0 up to 3^9), but since we're starting from the innermost, it's 9 layers, so n=9, leading to 3^{10}. But the formula still holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let me write down the first few terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 13 L3 = 40 L4 = 121 L5 = 364 L6 = 1093 L7 = 3280 L8 = 9841 L9 = 29524 Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's look at the recursive relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where n >= 2, and L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10}/2) - 1/2 ) = 3*(59049/2 - 1/2) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*term. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. We can express this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3, b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_1=4, then 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => L_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, L_0=1. Then, the general formula would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1. Since L_0=1, this becomes L_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2. Simplifying that, L_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is being multiplied by 3, so the total expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and we have 9 layers, the total expression is 3*(sum of a geometric series). But since I've already computed it step by step and confirmed it with the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. So, to recap: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). 3. Compute each layer up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524. 4.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can compute up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find the value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * Layer 9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + (a_0 - c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^{n}), assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, but in this case, a_1 = 4, and each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I get the same final answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B). Therefore, to satisfy this equality for all n, we must have B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the earlier result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is following a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series. But the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here. So, after computing each layer up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I don't need to go that far since I've already computed it step by step. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is a linear function of the previous one, and perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see. Let me try to express L_n in terms of L_{n-1}. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*a. So, if I let a1 = 1 + 3, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, then the total expression is 3*a9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. It looks like a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's another way to confirm the result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step seems manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly. Maybe the general formula for such a nested expression with n layers is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test that. If n=1, then (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches Layer 1:4. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2:13. For n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3:40. So yes, the formula seems to hold. So, in general, for each layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of a geometric series or recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe since it's only 9 layers, computing each step as I did before is manageable. Alternatively, we can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(L_9), where L_9 is computed as above.

    "text": " Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed. This seems like a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression inside the outermost 3 is a_9, which is 29524, as computed. So, 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize it as a geometric series and compute it using exponents, I arrive at the same result. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my step-by-step computation seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * (L1 - c) + c, where c is the constant term when the recurrence reaches equilibrium. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the final value is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the formula, I end up with the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let's see: Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's model it. Let me denote L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. Wait, but that seems odd because all our layers are positive integers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's try solving the recurrence properly. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The standard approach for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have n=9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, since each layer is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula, without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the value of each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = C*3^2 + D = 9C + D. Now, we can set up the system of equations: 3C + D = 4 9C + D = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9C + D) - (3C + D) = 13 - 4 => 6C = 9 => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute C back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 => 9/2 + D = 4 => D = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9) where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, in general, each layer n is 1 + 3*(layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially if there are more layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this expression. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each a_i step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Alternatively, I can check with a smaller number of layers to ensure my approach is correct. Let's say if the expression had only one layer: 3*(1 +3) =3*4=12. Using the formula, n=1, a_1=4, 3*a_1=12. Correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Using the formula, a_2=13, 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, three layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Wait, no, wait, three layers would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))). Wait, no, actually, three layers would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Let me compute that: Innermost:1+3=4; next layer:1 +3*4=13; outermost layer:1 +3*13=40; then multiply by 3:3*40=120. Using the formula, a_3=40, 3*a_3=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it works for n=9 as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So the general formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Wait, but actually, L1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so L1 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The general solution for Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 is Ln = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test for n=1: L1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But L1 is actually 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial condition is wrong. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me consider the recurrence relation more carefully. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, for n=1, L1=4; n=2, L2=13; n=3, L3=40, etc. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let's write out the terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 108 = 121 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each Ln seems to be the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}, but multiplied by something.

Yes, that's correct. So, in general, Ln = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but for L1, it's 4=3+1, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k, which is 1+3=4. For L2, sum from k=0 to 2: 1+3+9=13. For L3, sum from k=0 to 3: 1+3+9+27=40. So, in general, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let's check that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, each Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, it's L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer step by step and then derived a general formula to confirm. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The outermost layer evaluates to 29524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think if that applies here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let me assume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, set equal to left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I still get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29,524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without computing each layer. Since each layer is defined by a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster. Let's see, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about the recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute Layer 9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yep, same result.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. When n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, a_2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before, so that confirms it. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression. The solution to such a recurrence is indeed a geometric series, as we've modeled above. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see. Each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3, and there are 9 layers, the total would be a sum of a geometric series. But in this case, since each layer depends on the previous one, it's more of a recursive geometric progression. But using the formula we derived, it's straightforward. So, in summary, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up until the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we do 1 + 3*previous. That's a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time if I have to do this for more layers. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute a_n directly, without computing each layer step by step. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, then multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me consider the recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that directly: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, it becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and formula, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it more efficiently, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for this case, since the number of layers is small (only 9), computing each term step by step is manageable. But just for fun, let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using methods for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3. So, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3=177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572.
