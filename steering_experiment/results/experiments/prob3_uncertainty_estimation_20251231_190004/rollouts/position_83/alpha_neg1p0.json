    "text": " Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on. So, each layer is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Wait, 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. If I expand this expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Expanding this would result in 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). If I distribute the 3s, each layer contributes 3^k where k is the number of layers from the outside. Let me see: The innermost term is 1, then each layer adds 3 times that. So, the total would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But this seems recursive. Alternatively, since we have nine layers, maybe we can express it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me think. Each time we go out a layer, we multiply by 3. So, starting from the innermost 1, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it's like 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, that's similar to the original expression. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to write it out. Let me consider the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, maybe the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Alternatively, let me think of it as each layer contributing 1 multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, starting from the innermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are eight layers above it), then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. Wait, that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so the coefficients might be different. Let me try to write the expansion step by step. Let me denote the innermost term as T1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. T3 = 1 + 3*T2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. T4 = 1 + 3*T3 = 1 + 120 = 121. T5 = 1 + 3*T4 = 1 + 363 = 364. T6 = 1 + 3*T5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. T7 = 1 + 3*T6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. T8 = 1 + 3*T7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. T9 = 1 + 3*T8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then E = 3*T9 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, E = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9: 3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: As above, 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Let me consider the recursive formula: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is efficient. But since I was able to compute it step by step as well, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, computing up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small (n=9), it's easier to compute each term step by step. However, for better understanding, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, if I consider that the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, I went through each one. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and finding a recurrence relation can simplify the problem. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Either way, I get the same result.

That seems correct. But let me check with another approach to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Wait, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, we can think of this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a linear one, so maybe we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as the sum of a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're adding 1 and then tripling. But perhaps the closed-form approach is more efficient here. Either way, I've confirmed that a_9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is a nested multiplication, which can be thought of as a geometric series, but it's not exactly a simple geometric series because each term is being added to 1 before being multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me think about it. If I have a term like x = 1 + 3x', where x' is the next term. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. That's exactly what I did earlier. So, computing each a_i step by step is the way to go. Let me check my computations again: a1: 1 + 3 = 4 a2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursion. Let me consider the general case. Suppose I have a nested expression with n layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). Let me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let\u2019s denote the value at each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous one, so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. The number of terms would be 9, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here because each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3, which complicates things. However, since I already have a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, I think that's sufficient. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation. 4. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer. 5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches gave me the same result, which is a good sign.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we determine that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, no errors detected in the layers. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula confirms that the result is 88572.

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, we can solve for A and B. Let's assume that the steady-state solution is a constant, so B = 1/(3 - 1) = 1/2. Wait, no, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure it's consistent. Let's take n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches my earlier calculation.

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have a \"1+3(\", which is 9 times. So, layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost. So, 9 layers, which I computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, yeah, that's the same as before. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, each subsequent L is 1 + 3 times the prior. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, solving this recurrence. It's a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13.

Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric sequence or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall, for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Wait, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if they match. For example, layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, I think I've correctly computed each layer and the final result. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to check, maybe there's a geometric series or something similar going on here. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Here, we have 9 layers, so n=9. The function f(n) would be 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). Let me compute f(n) for n=1 to 9: f(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, total = 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say f_p. Plugging into the recurrence: f_p = 1 + 3*f_p. Solving for f_p: f_p - 3*f_p = 1 => -2*f_p = 1 => f_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3, n2 = 1 + 3n1, n3 = 1 + 3n2, etc. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 )? Wait, no. Wait, the innermost expression is a1=4, which is (3^2 -1)/2=4. Then a2=13=(3^3 -1)/2. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since there are 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, so the outermost is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of 3^10. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))). Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1 +3=4, and each layer adds a power of 3. So, perhaps the total can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me think. If I expand the expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... +3^9*1 +3^{10}. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me try to expand it step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as E1 =1 +3=4. Then the next layer is E2=1 +3*E1=1+12=13. Then E3=1+3*E2=1+39=40. And so on, up to E9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524. Then E=3*E9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I think of each E_i =1 +3*E_{i-1}, starting from E1=4. Then E_i =1 +3*E_{i-1}. So, for i=1 to 9, E_i =1 +3*E_{i-1}, with E0=1? Wait, no, E1=1 +3=4, so maybe E0 is undefined. Alternatively, perhaps I can write E_n =1 +3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. Then, as I did before, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then E=3*E9=3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me try to express E in terms of a sum. Each time we have a term like 3^k, where k goes from 1 to 10. Wait, let's see:\n\nE = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))) \n\nIf I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))) \n\nSo, E =3*1 +3*3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )) \n\nBut the term inside is similar to E, except it's missing the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4=3 +1\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +9 +3=13=3^2 +3^1 +1\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*(3^2 +3^1 +1)=1 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1=1 +27 +9 +3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1\n\nWait, no, 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40, which is 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1? Wait, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, sum is 27+9+3=39, plus 1 is 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*40=1 +120=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1? Let's check: 3^4=81, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, sum is 81+27=108 +9=117 +3=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nSo, each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but wait, actually, Layer1=4=3^1 +1, Layer2=13=3^2 +3^1 +1, Layer3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1, etc. So, Layer m = sum_{k=0}^{m} 3^k? Wait, no, because Layer1=4=3^1 +1, which is sum_{k=0}^1 3^k=1 +3=4. Layer2=13=1 +3 +9=13, which is sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=1 +3 +9=13. Layer3=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is sum_{k=0}^3 3^k=40. Wait, but 1 +3 +9 +27=40? 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes. So, Layer m is equal to sum_{k=0}^m 3^k. Therefore, Layer9= sum_{k=0}^9 3^k. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^n r^k = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/(3-1)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, Layer9=29524, and E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify the sum formula again. The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is indeed (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also led me to the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the geometric series formula\u2014give the same result. So, I think I'm done.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That seems like a recursive sequence. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, the sequence is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c - 1)) * c^{n - 1} - d/(c - 1). Let me plug in the values. Here, a_1 = 4, c = 3, d = 1. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/(3 - 1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2. Simplifying further, 9/2 * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1. a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's good. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. Since 3^10=59049, 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using both methods to ensure consistency. Let's compute Layer 4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Which matches my previous computation. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works, and therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without so much step-by-step calculation. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the closed-form formula. That's reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and got the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's 3^{10} which is indeed 59049. So, yes, that's correct. Then, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 +29524 = 59048, plus 29524: 59048 +29524. Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, +9524=79048+9524=88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus three times the next inner layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check one more time, maybe I messed up a layer. Let's see: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express this without computing each layer, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, we can model this recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, we could have computed it directly without computing each layer. But since I didn't remember the formula initially, breaking it down step by step was a good approach. It's also a good way to avoid mistakes, as each layer builds on the previous one, so if I had messed up one layer, it would have affected all subsequent layers. But since I double-checked each layer, I can be confident that the result is correct. Another way to think about it is that each time you add another layer, you're essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Anyway, the step-by-step approach seems solid, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc., up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so maybe we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, let's rearrange: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1, so D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 ) = (3^{11})/2 - 3/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147)/2 - 3/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. That's a good consistency check. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L0 + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, which would be the first term. So, perhaps L_n = 3^{n} * L0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1). But since L1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so L0 would be 1? Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L1 = 4, L2 = 13, etc., perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. Let me try to compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern. Let's compute L1 to L9:\n\nn | Ln\n---|---\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the formula seems to hold.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each layer follows a certain sequence. Let's list the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. For example:\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on. So, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term in this sequence. Let's denote a_n as the value of Layer n.\n\nGiven:\na_1 = 4\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think about it. The entire expression is 3*(a_9). From the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me do a quick check on the initial step-by-step computation. I had Layer 1 to Layer 9 as 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Since each step checks out, and the formula confirms it, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was to recognize the pattern and compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation formula made it quicker, especially for more layers, but in this case, with only nine layers, step-by-step was manageable.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So it's a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for this recursion. The general form is Layer n = a*Layer n-1 + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution for such a recurrence is known. For a linear recurrence of the form x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b, the closed-form solution is x_n = a^n * x_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where x_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is x_1. But let's adjust the indices. Let me define x_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then x_1 would be 1 + 3*x_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. So, in this case, the general formula would be x_n = 3*x_{n-1} + 1, starting with x_0 = 4. So, to find x_8, since we have 9 layers, but starting from x_0 to x_8. Let's see. The closed-form solution for x_n would be x_n = 3^n * x_0 + (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1, since b = 1. So, x_n = 3^n * 4 + (3^n - 1)/2 * 1. Simplifying, x_n = 4*3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Let me compute x_8 using this formula. First, compute 3^8. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561. So, 3^8 = 6561. Then, x_8 = 4*6561 + (6561 - 1)/2. Let's compute each part: 4*6561: 6561 * 4. Let me compute 6000*4=24000, 500*4=2000, 60*4=240, 1*4=4. So 24000 + 2000 = 26000, +240 = 26240, +4 = 26244. Next, (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. So, x_8 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see if that approach works. Starting from the innermost, Layer 1 = 4 = 1 + 3. Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. It looks like each layer is adding 3^(n) where n starts at 0. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, actually, the first term is 1, which is 3^0, and then each subsequent term is 3^1, 3^2, etc. So, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2. So, yes, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, the sum would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. This approach using the geometric series formula seems more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step. So, I can confidently say that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows the use of the sum formula, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a geometric series with a common ratio of 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Geometric Series Formula**: The sum of the series up to Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's see: The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. At n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, let's consider the steady-state solution when n approaches infinity, but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms and see if we can find a pattern. From earlier computations: L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous minus 2? Wait, let's check: L2 = 13, which is 3*4 +1? Wait, no. Wait, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 39 +1. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, the recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The solution to this recurrence is L(n) = (L(1) - (1)/(3-1)) * 3^n + (1)/(3-1). Let me recall the formula for such linear recurrences. The general solution is L(n) = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, since Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting with Layer 1 = 4, then Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1), which has the solution Layer(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer_p. Plugging into the recurrence: Layer_p = 1 + 3*Layer_p. Solving for Layer_p: Layer_p - 3*Layer_p = 1 => -2*Layer_p = 1 => Layer_p = -1/2. So the general solution is Layer(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition Layer(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1: n=1, Layer(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, Layer(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L_9). And since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, with the final layer resulting in 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or follows some other pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 3^10 *3=59049*3=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.
