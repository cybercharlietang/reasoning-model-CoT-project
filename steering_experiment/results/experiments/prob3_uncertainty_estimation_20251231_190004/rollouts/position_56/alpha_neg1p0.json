Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again:\n\nStarting with 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo that gives 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. However, if there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or recognizing it as a geometric series might be more efficient.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, since n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer's value. Using both step-by-step computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal computation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So writing it out: 6 (from 2*3), then 27: write 7, carry 2; 15+2=17: write 7, carry 1; 6+1=7; 12: write 2, carry 1. Wait, but that might not be the right way because when you have multiple digits, you need to process each digit with its place. Alternatively, perhaps I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which is 88572. But wait, let me count how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...), so:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Because the expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are 8 more layers? Wait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So starting from the first \"1+3(\", how many are there?\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n3(1+3(...)) where the innermost is 1+3(...). Each time we have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n   - Inside, the first \"1+3(\" is the first layer.\n   - Then another \"1+3(\", that's the second layer.\n   - Continuing until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.

So, in total, there are nine layers inside the initial 3. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3*(1+3(...)), and inside that, there are eight more \"1+3(\" expressions, making a total of nine layers. So, yes, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have a similar expression with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, computing directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller expressions, so I'm confident it works for the larger one as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

Let me recheck each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I still arrive at the same answer, 88,572. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression, perhaps I can write it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the innermost layer first. Starting with the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27. Wait, so each time, we're adding another term of 3^{n}. So, maybe each layer is the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^{n}. Let me see. Let's compute a few layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^0 +3^1 =1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(Layer1) =1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13. But if I expand it, it's 1 +3*(1 +3) =1 +3 +9=13, which is 3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Expanding, it's 1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nSo, each layer n adds another term 3^{n}.\n\nTherefore, for layer k, the value is the sum from i=0 to i=k of 3^i.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so the sum would be from i=0 to i=9 of 3^i, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what we had earlier. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i), that would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, using the geometric series formula, I can compute the sum inside and then multiply by 3.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered multiple methods: computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, and using the geometric series formula. All of them lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression.

Hmm, that seems consistent. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what we computed. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall how to solve such recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - r*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, where A is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = c + r*K. Solving for K: K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + K. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*r^1 + K => 4 = A*r + K. But we know that K = c/(1 - r). In our case, c=1 and r=3, so K=1/(1 - 3)= -1/2. So, 4 = A*3 + (-1/2). Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2). Simplifying: a_n= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3^{11}=177147, so 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when I compute layer by layer, I might have made a mistake. Let me recast the problem as a recursive expression. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121, f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364, f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for f(n). Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, f(9)=29524, then the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something like that. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which, as we saw, is 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 =88572. Which again, confirms our earlier result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a repeated structure where each term is 1 + 3*(next term).

Wait, that would be 88752? Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.

Wait, that would be 88752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, that would be 88 572? Wait, no, the digits should be arranged as 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Oh! I see where I messed up earlier. When I wrote down the digits from left to right, I thought the first digit was from the ten thousands place, but actually, in the multiplication, the carry over affects the next higher digit. So, when I wrote 8 from the ten thousands place, that's correct because 2*3 is 6, plus the carryover 2 gives 8. Then the next digit is 9*3 +1=28, so 8 in the thousands place, carryover 2. Then 5*3=15, so 5 in the hundreds, carryover 1. Then 2*3 +1=7 in the tens, and 4*3=12, so 2 in the units. So the number is 88572, not 88752. I must have transposed some digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method to be sure.

Alternatively, I can try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s define L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), for n \u2265 2.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps leading to a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1).\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I've already computed:\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds true for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nTherefore, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 /2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, arriving at the same result.\n\nTherefore, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or some kind of pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolve for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer, L_1, is 4, and each subsequent layer is built using this recurrence, which we can now compute directly using the formula.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it. The entire expression can be represented as (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut regardless, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3^{11} and see.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's count how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me remove the outermost 3 for a moment and focus on the inner part:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...).

Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions like this, you can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nThis is a finite nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Each layer can be considered as a term in a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nSimilarly, L_3=1 +3*L_2=40, etc., up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, for n >=2, and L_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1 => B= -1/2\n\nNow, we can write L_n = A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3A -1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A\n\nThus, A=4.5 /3= 1.5= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, verified each layer, used a recurrence relation approach, found a closed-form solution, and confirmed the result using two different methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form solution to confirm the result. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, but let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5. 9*3=27+1=28, 8. 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let me recalculate each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive expression where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let me check the terms again: a1 = 4, a2 = 13, a3 = 40, a4 = 121, a5 = 364, a6 = 1093, a7 = 3280, a8 = 9841, a9 = 29524. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then the total is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. If a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, which seems odd because all the a_n terms are integers. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution is the way to go. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, yeah, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake: Starting from the innermost, the first layer is 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each opening parenthesis is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each adding a new layer. So, yes, 9 layers. So, the layers I computed earlier are correct, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each building on the previous one. Then, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula and confirm the result that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve this. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify with a different method, and in this case, solving the recurrence relation gave me the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost layer: Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the entire expression can be seen as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to express the innermost term as 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 9, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) =1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. So, each layer adds another term which is 3^k, where k increases by 1 each layer. Since there are 9 layers, the innermost term is 3^1, and the outermost term would be 3^9. Wait, but let me think again. Actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the expansion is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Let me check that. Let me compute the expression for a small n to see. Suppose n=1: 3*(1 + 3) =3*4=12. Alternatively, using the sum: 3*(1 + 3) =3*4=12. Now, if I expand it as a sum: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but in the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, perhaps the total sum is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, because each layer adds a term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13, which is 1 +3 +9. The next layer is 1 +3*13=1 +39=40=1 +3 +9 +27. So, each layer adds the next power of 3. So, after 9 layers, the innermost term would have 3^9, so the sum inside would be 1 +3 +3^2 + ... +3^9. So, the sum S = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*S =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just confirm once more with the recurrence relation approach. As I found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can simplify the expression. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that the value of each layer can be expressed as a geometric series. Summing this series and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula that can compute the result without manually calculating each layer.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the iterative method and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000*3=87000\n\n524*3=1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 +1572=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and using two different methods, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is 1 + 3(...).

Let's count how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen each layer wraps around the previous one, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, because the outermost is 3*(...), which is Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are nine instances of 1+3( before the innermost 1+3). So, that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\n3( Layer9 )\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3( Layer8 )\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3( Layer7 )\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3( Layer6 )\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3( Layer5 )\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3( Layer4 )\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3( Layer3 )\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3( Layer2 )\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3( Layer1 )\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nSo, yes, that's nine layers, each depending on the previous one. So, starting from Layer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make absolutely sure. Let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should give the correct result.\n\nWait, but let me check another small example to be thorough. Let's take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother one: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). As above, that's 120.\n\nSo, the method seems solid.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, with nine layers, each computed as above, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I computed Layer9, I used 3*9841=29523, then added 1 to get 29524. Let me check that multiplication again.\n\n3*9841:\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Correct.\n\nThen, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually, say Layer5.\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if I can find a general formula for this kind of expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the general formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if that formula holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3 = 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, each layer is built from the previous one, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, up to Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, 3*a_9=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88,572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. This method using the recurrence relation is more efficient and confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI wonder if each term is following a specific pattern. Let me see:\n\nFrom a_1 to a_2: 4 to 13. 4*3 + 1 = 13. Yes, that's the recurrence.\n\nSimilarly, 13*3 + 1 = 40. 40*3 + 1 = 121. 121*3 + 1 = 364, etc.\n\nSo the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nAssume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the layers. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

So putting it together: 88,572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(1+... parts. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. Continuing, up until the last (1+3), which is Layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, my final answer should be 88,572. Hmm, just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. So, yes, that's correct.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, which could be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. Let's denote L1 = 1 +3 =4. Then L2=1 +3*L1=1 +3*4=13. L3=1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40. L4=1 +3*L3=1 +120=121. Hmm, I notice that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The formula is: L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*( (a^{n} -1)/(a -1) ). But in our case, L1 =4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me check that. Let's define L_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from n=1 as 4. Then, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. So, to solve this, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*(3)^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: At n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire computation in terms of exponents, I could note that each layer is contributing a power of 3. But since I already have the formula, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes: 1. Recognized the nested structure and the recurrence relation. 2. Computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Verified each computation to avoid arithmetic errors. 4. Derived a general formula for the nth layer using linear recurrence techniques. 5. Applied the formula to find Layer9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. 6. Cross-verified both methods to ensure consistency. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, my calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = A*3^n. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a formula for the nth layer. Applying this formula and computing step by step yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing from right to left, we get 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit surprised it's so large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like these can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 counting, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a general formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and propagate it outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify my calculations for each layer again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let's go through each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at the sequence: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. At n=1, L_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. At n=0, what would L_0 be? Well, if we consider n=0, it would be the innermost term before the first layer, which is just 1. So, L_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 2) A + B = 1 (from n=0) Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That's much faster and reduces the chance of error. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can solve for A and B using the initial conditions.\n\nGiven that L_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L_2 = 13:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm applying the formula correctly. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step without using the formula, just to confirm that I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12, units place is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, tens place is 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, thousands place is 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, ten thousands place is 8. So putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1. Let me check the initial term: a_1 = 4. Wait, but if I think of a_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_1 would be 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * d, where d = 1. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. So, solving this, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging in, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_0 = 4, we have 4 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (9*3^n - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=0: (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (9*3^n -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, a_9 = (9*19683 -1)/2. Compute 9*19683: 19683 * 9. Let's compute that: 19683 * 9: 19000*9=171000, 600*9=5400, 80*9=720, 3*9=27. So, 171000 + 5400 = 176400; 176400 + 720 = 177120; 177120 + 27 = 177147. So, 9*19683=177147. Then, subtract 1: 177147 -1 = 177146. Now, divide by 2: 177146 / 2 = 88573. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got 29524 for Layer 9, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, now there's a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let me check where I might have gone wrong. Wait, if using the formula, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. But in my step-by-step, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. There's a difference of 1 here. That suggests I made an error in one of the computations. Let me check my step-by-step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, it should be 88573. Hmm, that's odd. Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Maybe in the formula, n=9 corresponds to the 10th layer? Let me check. Wait, no. In the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. But in my step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 9 and got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But the formula gives a_9 =88573, which is one more. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula was a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. Wait, in the formula, a_n is the value inside the 3*(...). So, in the problem, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = 88573. Therefore, the total expression would be 3*88573 = 265719? Wait, that can't be right because when I computed step-by-step, I got 88572, which is 3*29524. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's application. Let me re-examine the formula. The formula I derived was for a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4. So, a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19683 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 88573, and the entire expression is 3*88573=265719. But this contradicts my step-by-step calculation where I had 3*(29524)=88572. There's a clear discrepancy here, so I must have made an error in one of the methods. Let me check my step-by-step again, perhaps I missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere. Let me list the layers with their computed values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to the formula, a_9=88573, which would mean that 3*a_9=265719, which is way larger. So, clearly, I'm misunderstanding the formula's application. Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0=4. So, for each layer, it's 1 +3*previous layer. Therefore, a_1=13, a_2=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the formula I derived was incorrect because I misapplied it. Let me re-examine the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the nth term after the initial a_0. So, if a_0=4, then a_1=13, a_2=40, etc., so a_n corresponds to the nth layer. Therefore, a_9 would be the 9th layer, which is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, perhaps the formula I derived earlier was incorrect because I didn't account for the initial term correctly.\n\nWait, let me try deriving the formula again. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: P =1 +3*P => P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_0=4: 4 = A*3^0 -1/2 => 4 = A -1/2 => A=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n=(9/2)*3^n -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n=(9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=0: (9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1: (9*3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=5: (9*243 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=6: (9*729 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=7: (9*2187 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=8: (9*6561 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nn=9: (9*19683 -1)/2=(177147-1)/2=177146/2=88573. Wait, but according to my step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is n=8. So, there's a confusion here. It seems that in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers, but in my step-by-step, I started from a_1=4 as the innermost, which is n=1, and a_9=29524 would be n=9 in the formula. Wait, no, in the formula, a_n is defined with a_0=4, so a_1=13, which is the first layer outside the innermost. So, in the problem, the innermost is a_0=4, then each layer adds a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_8, because starting from a_0=4, we have 9 layers up to a_8. Wait, let's count:\n\na_0=4 (innermost)\n\na_1=13\n\na_2=40\n\na_3=121\n\na_4=364\n\na_5=1093\n\na_6=3280\n\na_7=9841\n\na_8=29524\n\nSo, the outermost layer is a_8=29524, which is the 9th term starting from a_0. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572, which matches my step-by-step calculation. So, the formula gives a_8= (9*3^8 -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^8=6561\n\n9*6561=59049\n\n59049 -1=59048\n\n59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives a_8=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the earlier confusion was due to misindexing the layers. The formula correctly gives a_8=29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
