Wait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15, so 5 with carryover 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when doing these step-by-step computations, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as I did before. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if that formula holds.\n\nWait, for n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe I have the wrong formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution to the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition, say when n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 29,524 *3: Let me compute 29,524 *3 step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 *3 as follows: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, computing each layer step by step gives us 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 is 29 thousand 524. 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. Let me verify that with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3)\n\nCompute 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? Because each time, it's one more layer until the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that's correct because there are 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscalculated somewhere because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWait, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. That's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. So, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29,524, which seems correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572, which seems like a big number, but given the nesting, it's plausible. Let me just verify one more layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let's check Layer 7 again: 1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, to see if there's a quicker way to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation confirms that the manual computation was correct. So, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer adds a factor of 3. So, the expression can be represented as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... )))).\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's a bit more complex.\n\nBut using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward here, and it's already confirmed the result.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation approach, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward and using a recurrence relation to verify, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's write 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nCalculate each digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around that. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 4, that's correct, and then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, I think my calculation is correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nLet's find A and B. We know that L_1 = 4.\n\nPlugging n = 1 into the general solution:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe also know that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A = 0. But since our expression is finite (n=9), maybe we can find a pattern without solving the recurrence. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, we can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. The innermost layer is \\( L_1 \\), and each subsequent layer is computed using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Verify the result using the recurrence relation formula:\n   - The general solution for the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 + 3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But it's good to know that the general formula exists for such nested expressions, which can save time if the number of layers is large. So, in summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying each computation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A +1 \u21d2 A -3A =1 \u21d2 -2A=1 \u21d2 A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is added 1, it's a bit different, so the formula I derived earlier applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I can write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) nine times. So, maybe it's a base 3 number or something, but I think my step-by-step approach is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step.\n\n29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524; 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3. But let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a better way to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at each layer, it seems like each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, the nth layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute 3*a_9 using the formula as well. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n- Each layer can be computed by starting from the innermost and working outwards.\n- Using the recurrence relation, I found a formula for each layer, which confirmed that the 9th layer is 29524.\n- Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n- Additionally, using the formula directly gave the same result without computing each layer step by step, which is a good consistency check.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed before. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. To summarize, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 at the ninth layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but recognizing the pattern allows us to use a formula, which is much faster and reduces the chance of errors. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 +1. So 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 +2400=29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, especially since this is a repeated multiplication and addition. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous solution first: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result, leading to a sequence where each term follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\).\n\nTo solve this efficiently, we recognize the recurrence as a linear relation and derive a closed-form formula using the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution is found to be \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer (\\(n = 9\\)), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\).

Wait, no, because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assume a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572 because 30000 \u00d7 3 is 90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 90000 - 476 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer's computation because if any of those layers was wrong, the final answer would be off.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each layer is computed correctly as I did above. Therefore, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 was 1 + 3*4=13, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but since r > 1, this might not converge, but since we're dealing with a finite number of terms, it's okay.\n\nLet me compute a_n for n layers. Here, n=9, but let's see.\n\nWait, in my earlier computation, I started with a_1=4, which is the innermost layer, and then built up to a_9=29524. Then the final result is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms using the formula to see if it matches my earlier computations.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that matches exactly. So, the formula works.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expressed as a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but 1/(1 - 3) is -1/2. So, a_n = (-1/2) + (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} = (-1/2) + (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} = (-1/2) + (9/2) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSimplifying that: a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9/2)*3^2 -1/2 = (9/2)*9 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (9/2)*27 -1/2 = 243/2 -1/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} -1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} -1/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 -1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3*29524 again.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d73.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), and the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each layer wraps around, so layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer 9, and then we multiply by 3. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9, and then we have 3*a_9. Using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute each layer using the formula instead of computing step by step, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me try that. For layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern in the layers. Let me list out the values again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nEach time, the value is 1 + 3*previous. So, from 4 to 13: 1 + 3*4 = 13. From 13 to 40: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Etc. So, that seems correct. Each step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the formula is correct, and the step-by-step computation is correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\).

So, I think my calculations are accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could be generalized. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe it's similar to a geometric series or something else. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives us the same result as computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series or something like that. But given the structure of the expression, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we solved earlier. So, I think the approach we took is the most straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could recognize the pattern as similar to a number in base 3 or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The recurrence method worked well.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the expression layer by layer and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I was able to compute each step accurately and arrive at the final answer. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify complex-looking problems.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply it by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nBut maybe another way: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute it digit by digit, I got 88572 as well. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so each layer checks out. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after each 1 + 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought before, because from the innermost (Layer 1) up to Layer 9, which is the first (1+3(...)) after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the structure as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each set of parentheses after the initial 3* is a layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each time there's a (1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is 9, because each time you have a (1 + 3(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check again, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, but that would be 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), so when I compute Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, 3 times that is indeed the total.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait, no, wait, in the three-layer case, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so let me compute it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the test case. Let me compute it properly.\n\nThree layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, confident that the answer for the nine-layer problem is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute another layer to ensure my approach is correct.\n\nFour layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 39)) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for four layers as well. Therefore, applying it to nine layers should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but let me verify that with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) * 3. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29,524 * 3 as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, that's an interesting observation. So, if I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute a_n directly without computing each layer step by step. Let me try that approach to see if it gives the same result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. First, let's find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 0 = 1 + 2K \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I found earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n = 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's another way to see it, which confirms the result again. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series\u2014the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods converge to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just noticed that the original problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers, right? Because each time you go one layer out, it's another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, that means the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, that's nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost 1 + 3. So, yes, my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and there are nine such layers. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is the one being multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, so if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's pretty cool. It avoids computing each layer step by step, which is especially useful if there are many layers.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, actually, the last one is 1+3), so that's the innermost layer. So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), so n=9. So, the formula gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have just computed each layer as I did before, which is a bit tedious but straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we determine that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Wait, is this a geometric series? Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me count: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, right? So, when we computed up to Layer 9, we got 29524, which according to the formula would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's check: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches. So, Layer 9 is 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Similarly, each step adds another 3*(previous term). So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but I already solved it step by step and using the recurrence relation, so maybe that's enough. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*something, which can be represented as (something*3 + 1). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*previous + 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, just in case I missed a digit somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then L_2=13, L_3=40, etc., up to L_9=29524. Then the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be represented as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as L_n^h = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

Wait, that would be 88752? Let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88572? Wait, wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let's do it more carefully:\n\nNumber: 29,524\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 8 (hundreds? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the digits are:\n\nFrom right to left:\n\n4, 2, 5, 9, 2.\n\nAfter multiplication:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right (starting from the highest place value):\n\n8 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8 (thousands place), then 8 (hundreds place?), wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the places.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply, the carryover affects the next higher digit. So, the digits from right to left are:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units: 2\n\n- Tens: 7\n\n- Hundreds: 5\n\n- Thousands: 8\n\n- Ten-thousands: 8\n\nSo, the number is 88,572? Wait, because the digits are 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. So, 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer. Since the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, each of those 9 corresponds to a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, D = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, the outermost layer is L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L_9, and L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed and used in the next outer layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this forms a geometric series or something that can be represented with a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if that's possible. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the sequence goes a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, etc., up to a9=29524. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, c=3, d=1, and a0 would be the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a1=4, which is when n=1, so maybe the formula needs to be adjusted. Let me think. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, with a0 given. Here, a1 = 1 + 3*a0, but in our case, a1 is 4, which comes from 1 + 3*1, where the innermost term is 1 + 3. So, perhaps a0 is 1, and a1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, then, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 3^n * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since c=3 and d=1, the formula becomes a_n = 3^n * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a0=1: 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which confirms the earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that makes sense. It's a large number, but given the repeated multiplication by 3, it's expected. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the innermost layer is computed, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. There are nine layers of parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2), but I might be misremembering the exact formula. Alternatively, let's solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\na_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\na_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\na_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\na_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\na_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\na_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\na_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me confirm 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88,572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost 1+3: that's 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got before. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, double-checked the calculations, and even used a different method (the recurrence relation) to arrive at the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.\n\nJust to recap, the key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer one by one. Each layer's value was used in the computation of the next outer layer. Once I reached the outermost layer, I just had to multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. Using the recurrence relation helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was accurate. So, I'm pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct result for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the layers again in a different way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer. So,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive formula, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for L(n). Let me see.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution for such a linear recurrence. For a recurrence relation of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is:\n\nL(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, L(1) = 4, so maybe L(0) would be 1? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, if we think of L(1) as the first layer, which is 1 + 3, then perhaps L(0) would be 1, because if n=0, then L(0) = 1. Let me test that.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nL(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nHere, a=3, b=1, L(0)=1.\n\nSo, L(n) = 3^n * 1 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSimplify that: (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express the entire computation using this formula. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSimplify that: (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify 3^{11}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the expression as a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern where each layer is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, for Layer n, it's the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps each layer is a partial sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, considering that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nThis is similar to an infinite geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but in this case, it's finite, with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r=3, n=number of terms.\n\nBut in our case, each layer is building up to a sum that's similar to this.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula for the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n, multiplied by 1/2.\n\nWait, because the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches Layer n.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the geometric series formula. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using the sum of a geometric series. \n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe using distributive property or another approach to see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we can write this recurrence relation as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is the particular solution.\n\nTo find D, we set a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me check for n=9: 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series from the start, without computing each layer.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as x, so x = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*x, where x is the next inner layer.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding the entire expression would help. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer step by step, but perhaps writing out the entire expansion would be too cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nWait, from the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with 9 threes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer adds a power of 3.\n\nWait, considering that each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, perhaps the total expression can be represented as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k).\n\nWait, let's test that idea.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but using the formula we have, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with 9 layers of 3s. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to see how many terms there are when fully expanded.\n\nEach time we have a 1 and a 3*something. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to accept that the formula we have gives us a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} directly.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThen, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more that a_9=29524 and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression without using the formula, just by expanding each layer step by step, as I did earlier, and confirm that I get the same result.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*29524 using another method to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nNow, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, when I computed a_9=29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine 3s. So, perhaps the expression can be represented as 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each term is nested, not summed directly.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive structure, not a simple sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, but I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the sum would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut in this case, it's finite, with nine layers, so it's a finite geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression, so E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine 3s.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to consider the innermost part first.\n\nWait, but I think I've spent enough time verifying that the result is 88572, so perhaps I can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, perhaps I can compute each layer again, but this time, I'll write out each step in detail.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer grows exponentially, which makes the number get large quickly.

Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try solving this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which is faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since it's only nine layers, manual computation is feasible too.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But let me just double-check my earlier computations because I feel like that might be a large number. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the layers seem correct. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set b_n = a_n + c, so the equation becomes b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. That's a homogeneous recurrence with solution b_n = k*3^n. Then, a_n = b_n - c = k*3^n - c. Plugging back into the original equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => k*3^n - c = 1 + 3*(k*3^{n-1} - c) => k*3^n - c = 1 + k*3^n - 3c => Simplify both sides: k*3^n - c = k*3^n + 1 - 3c => Subtract k*3^n from both sides: -c = 1 - 3c => 2c = 1 => c = 1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = k*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = k*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3k - 1/2 => 3k = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => k = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, but 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes now. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped a lot. I was worried I might have made an arithmetic error somewhere, especially with such large numbers, but it seems consistent. So, yeah, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:  \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression without computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value at each layer, starting from the innermost, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n - 1}.\n\nWait, but let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust the indices properly. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems to work. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it and it gives the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value at each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This repeats nine times, with the entire expression then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

It's important to take it one step at a time to avoid mistakes, especially with so many layers involved. I think I did it correctly, but if I had a doubt, I could also compute the expression from the outside in, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I could use a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer follows the form of a geometric series, but perhaps it's more straightforward to compute each layer as I did. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nWe can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back, the original expression has 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWow, that's a much more efficient way! Instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, both methods were manageable.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, I found a closed-form solution, which allowed me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. Then, multiplying the result by 3 gave the final answer.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I double-checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by using the recurrence relation method, and both gave me the same result. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and I'm satisfied with the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + \\dots + 3(1 + 3))\\dots))\n   \\]\n   with nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer from the inside out. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   The general solution for the recurrence \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute for n = 9:**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, that seems correct? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

But let me check one more time, perhaps using a different approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute the 9th term without having to compute each step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that confirms the answer is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirmed the result. So, yeah, that's how I would solve this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Wait, but actually, a_1 is 1+3, which is 4, then a_2=1+3*4=13, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it iteratively since it's only 9 terms. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. Here, c=3, d=1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). Let me check that. The general solution is indeed a_n = (a_1 + (d)/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - (d)/(c-1). Plugging in c=3, d=1, a_1=4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (9 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Alternatively, 3^{n+1} -1 / 2. Wait, let me compute 9 * 3^{n-1}: 9 is 3^2, so 3^2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify that with the values I computed earlier. For n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as I computed before. So, the recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula instead of expanding each layer. That might be faster, especially if there are more layers. But since I only had 9 layers, expanding each wasn't too bad. Anyway, I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let's write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer's computation checks out, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems accurate. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
