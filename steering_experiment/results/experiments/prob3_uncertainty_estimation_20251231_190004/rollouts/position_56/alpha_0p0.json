    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1, write 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5 *3=15, carryover1, write5. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8, write8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 and carryover1. Next digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Next:5*3=15, so 5 and carryover1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 and carryover2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer would be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Then Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems to check out. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. So a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Then a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now applying initial condition: For n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. So for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So yeah, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 30000 * 3 is 90000, so 29524 *3 should be a bit less than 90000. But 88572 is less than 90000, so that seems plausible. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yes, it works. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, so for n layers, the value is (3^{n} -1)/2. But in this problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we saw. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form solution give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value step by step.

Let me think. This expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, and each layer adds 1 before multiplying. So, using the formula we derived, the innermost term is 4, and each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Therefore, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives us the value at each layer, and since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, I think that's solid. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524 *3. Let me compute this multiplication again: 29,524 *3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after all that, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we derive a general formula for a_n, which allows us to compute the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). But when I numbered them, I started from the innermost as Layer 1, so Layer 9 would be the outermost, which is correct. So, each time, I correctly computed each layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and formula, I end up with the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the way I approached it is solid.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I've checked each step, used two different methods to confirm the result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is then used in the next outer layer.

So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.

Let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3, as before, is 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding it step by step without layers, but that might take longer. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern or formula.\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I might have made a mistake in the layers, but since I double-checked each layer and even found a formula, I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, no, the first one is 3(1+3(..., then each subsequent is another 1+3(... So, starting from the innermost, how many layers? Let me think differently: each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a layer. The innermost is the 9th layer, and the outermost is the first. Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try to count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which seems to be 9 times. So, 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier calculation of 9 layers seems correct, ending with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire computation using exponents. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and starting from a_1=4, the expression can be written as:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, it's like building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\na_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 =1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on. But perhaps the formula I derived earlier is the most straightforward way.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the conclusion that the final result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2 \u2192 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So, putting it together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me compute it another way: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Because if there are 9 layers, that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4? Wait, no. Wait, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*L2=1 + 3*13=40. Hmm, I see that each layer is following the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern: L1=4 L2=1 + 3*4=13 L3=1 + 3*13=40 L4=1 + 3*40=121 L5=1 + 3*121=364 L6=1 + 3*364=1093 L7=1 + 3*1093=3280 L8=1 + 3*3280=9841 L9=1 + 3*9841=29524 As we saw earlier. Now, let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10}/2 -1/2) = 3*(59049/2 -1/2) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

That seems correct. Wait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each term is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as before. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the nth term a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Therefore, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to make sure each layer is correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, the Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. Each time, I computed up to Layer 9, so that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did before. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see if this sequence follows a pattern. Let me list the L_n values again: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 13 L_3 = 40 L_4 = 121 L_5 = 364 L_6 = 1093 L_7 = 3280 L_8 = 9841 L_9 = 29524 Looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. The recurrence seems to be L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that for n=0, L_0 would be undefined, but maybe we can still proceed. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recognize the pattern. Let me compute a few more terms to see if I can spot a pattern. L_1 = 4 = (3^2 + 1)/something? Wait, 4 is 3 + 1. 13 is 3*4 + 1. 40 is 3*13 + 1. Hmm, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Wow, that works! So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got before. So, that's a much faster way to compute it without having to go through each layer. Then, the final expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. That's a more efficient way to compute it, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it aligns with my step-by-step calculation. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) as a geometric series. Let me think about expanding the expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand it step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 1 + 3*40=121. Then, 1 + 3*121=364. Then, 1 + 3*364=1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093=3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280=9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, each term is 3*a_{n-1} +1. As I did earlier, which leads to the same conclusion. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that it's nested, maybe it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n-1} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find B by solving a_n = 1 + 3a_n. Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, from a_1 to a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way out.

So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form of a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to make arithmetic errors. So, using the formula is better. Let me just write down the steps using the formula for clarity. Given the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) This can be represented as 3*a_9, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. The closed-form solution for a_n is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think I've checked it thoroughly, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a closed-form formula and verifying it with the initial terms. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a geometric series? Let me see: The expression can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, since there are 9 layers, a_9 is the value we need before multiplying by 3. Alternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging B into the equation: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, from 4 = 3A + (-1/2), so 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form solution, which simplifies the computation. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each term can be thought of as 3^n times the initial 1, minus something. But the formula we derived earlier seems sufficient.

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recursive sequence. Let me define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, whose solution is Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp. Substituting into the recurrence: Lp = 3*Lp + 1 => Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, using the closed-form expression also gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) =88572. Alternatively, since Layer n = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) =3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the exponent directly. So, regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can determine that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating step by step from the innermost layer outward and applying the formula, we find the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b/(a - 1)). Let me check: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Let me see: Since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me compute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2: 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, yes, it's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$, which can be solved step by step.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, we determine that each layer $L_n$ is given by $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the 9th layer, $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow the formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recursion, just to confirm my step-by-step computation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting how the recursive approach and the closed-form solution both lead to the same result. I think this problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using recursion can simplify what initially looks like a complex nested expression.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation, let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and then multiplying the result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...).

Let me see how many layers there are. The expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), right? Because each time after the first 3(, we have a (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me look at the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each time, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested.

So, Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer9 is the outermost. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier calculations.

So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just thought of something. When I started, I thought the innermost layer was Layer1, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), but when I look at the expression, it's written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3(1+3)), which is Layer2, and Layer1 would be (1+3). Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is (1+3*(1+3)), which is (1+3*(Layer1)). So, perhaps my initial approach was correct. Let me confirm by writing out the entire expression with each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the expression again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, there are nine layers in total, each adding a new 1+3(...). So, my calculation of Layer9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. Each time we have a new (1+3(...)), starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the ninth layer.\n\nYes, so there are nine layers, each one adding another 1+3(...). So, my calculation of Layer9 being 29524 is correct, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me compute each layer once more:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(59048/2) = (3*59048)/2.\n\nCompute 59048 *3:\n\n59048 *3:\n\nCompute 50000*3=150000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n40*3=120\n\n8*3=24\n\nAdding up: 150000 + 27000 = 177000\n\n177000 + 120 = 177120\n\n177120 +24=177144\n\nSo, 59048 *3=177144\n\nThen, divide by 2: 177144 /2 =88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3 earlier, I thought it was 88572, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the general formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Since 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check each multiplication again. For example, when I computed Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building up a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The general formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, though, the recurrence is a bit different because each term depends on the previous one. But as we saw earlier, the solution ends up being (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth term. So, that's another way to approach it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression. Either way, the result is the same. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I can't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Calculating each layer step by step leads to the final value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series of sorts. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where there are 9 layers. Wait, but each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I can model it as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, and the next_layer is similar, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series with ratio 3. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which makes it a bit more complex. However, using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward. So, to wrap up, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

    "text": " 2 9 5 2 4 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So, 40000 + 18000 = 58000, +1000 = 59000, +40 = 59040, +8 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. Wait, that's not the right way. Let me add digit by digit: 59048 + 29524:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n0 +5=5, write 5.\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 *3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a2=1 +3*a1=1+3*4=13. a3=1 +3*a2=1+3*13=40. a4=1 +3*a3=1+3*40=121. a5=1 +3*a4=1+3*121=364. a6=1 +3*a5=1+3*364=1093. a7=1 +3*a6=1+3*1093=3280. a8=1 +3*a7=1+3*3280=9841. a9=1 +3*a8=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about the general form. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)). If this were infinite, it would converge to a solution of x = 1 + 3x, which gives x = -0.5, but that's not the case here. However, since this is a finite expression with 9 layers, maybe we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1} for n >1. Then, we can compute a_2 through a_9 as we did before. Alternatively, the recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -0.5. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-0.5). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -0.5 => 4 =3A -0.5 => 3A=4.5 => A=1.5. Therefore, the solution is a_n =1.5*3^n -0.5. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=1.5*3^1 -0.5=4.5 -0.5=4. Correct. n=2:1.5*9 -0.5=13.5 -0.5=13. Correct. n=3:1.5*27 -0.5=40.5 -0.5=40. Correct. n=4:1.5*81 -0.5=121.5 -0.5=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4.

Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\nRight side: A*3^n + (1 + 3B)\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B)\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is n=1, and the outermost is n=9. Therefore, the value of the outermost expression before multiplying by 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what we computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result again. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times and through different approaches. It seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. The final result, after computing all layers and multiplying by 3, is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digit places. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28.

Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572, which should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again. Let's compute Layer 1 through Layer 4 again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nYes, correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each step is correct.

So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a nested multiplication, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same result: 88572. That gives me more confidence that this is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as building up a number in base 3, but that might be overcomplicating things. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, for example, starting from 1, if I do 1 + 3*(1) = 4, which is 1 followed by 3 in base 3? Wait, 4 in base 3 is 11, but that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, each layer is a kind of expansion where you add 1 and then scale by 3, which is similar to how numbers are built in a certain base, but I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward here. Either way, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we find the final value.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

That seems correct.\n\nThen Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that step by step. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27.\n\nWait, but let's compute 9841*3 properly:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523.

Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8.

    "text": " 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, reading from top to bottom: 8, then 8, 7, 5, 7, 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n\nSo the result is 8 8 7 5 7 2? Wait, but that would be 88752. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 30000 *3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524 *3 properly.\n\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext, 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover1.\n\nNext, 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover2.\n\nNext, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down8.\n\nSo the number is 88572. Wait, but when I did 30000 -476=29524, then 3*29524=90000 - 1428=88572. So that's correct. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought it was 88752, which is wrong because I think I misplaced the digits. So the correct computation is 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more: 29524 *3:\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000 \u2192 total so far: 87000\n\n500 *3=1500 \u2192 total: 88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 total: 88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 total: 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 + 363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, let me see if that's the case. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThen, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = A.\n\nPlugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 +1/2 =3C \u2192 9/2=3C \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer1:1+3=4, then Layer2, up to Layer9, as we computed earlier. So n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, it's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. So the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
