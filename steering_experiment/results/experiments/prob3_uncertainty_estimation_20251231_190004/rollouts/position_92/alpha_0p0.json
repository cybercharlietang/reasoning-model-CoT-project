    "text": " Let me just check if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.

    "text": " Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. If a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is an additional 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). Up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, total layers inside are 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 9 layers inside, each time 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that's how we got up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, compute step by step: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that works.

    "text": " Let me see if there's another way to approach it, just to verify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3n1, and so on. So, in general, each term can be expressed as n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is n_k = a*3^k + b, where a and b are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, with n_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is n_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume n_k^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is n_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition n_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for k=9, n_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, n_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * n_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could write the expression as 3 multiplied by the sum of a geometric series, but given the small number of terms, computing each layer is straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each additional 1+3( adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) That's 9 layers. So, n_9 is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, as I computed earlier, n_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. Another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 3*(previous total) + 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*(current) +1. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the recurrence is n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, which is what I had before. So, yeah, that's consistent. So, given that, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Let me check if there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0, but in this case, the recurrence is a bit different because it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. The general formula for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is straightforward. However, just for knowledge, the closed-form formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be derived as follows: Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.

So, if I denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^n * C + d, where d is a constant. Let me recall the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C * a^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = a*D + b => D - a*D = b => D(1 - a) = b => D = b / (1 - a). So in this case, a = 3, b = 1. So D = 1 / (1 - 3) = 1 / (-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C * 3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L(1) = 4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.

But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as T_n = 1 + 3*T_{n-1}, starting from T_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost term is T_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then T_2 = 1 + 3*T_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to T_9. Then the entire expression is 3*T_9. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see: The recurrence is T_n = 1 + 3*T_{n-1}, with T_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for T_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is T_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: T_n = 1 + 3*T_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is T_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition T_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, T_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, T_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, T_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, T_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*T_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p.

So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers are there? Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would correspond to n=9 in the formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.

    "text": " Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is straightforward. Alternatively, we can express this as L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1, L_1=4. If n=1, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe that formula isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 2*3^{n} -1. Let's test that. For n=1: 2*3^1 -1=6-1=5, which is not 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)}=A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)}=C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So Layer 9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.

So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3r, which is not correct. Wait, the recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plug into the recurrence: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but in this case, since it's nested, the formula approach is more efficient.

Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recurrence relation as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=0, if we consider L_0, but since our layers start at n=1, perhaps it's better to use another approach. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=9, so S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's the sum inside the parentheses before multiplying by 3. So, E = 3*(9841) = 29523. Wait, but earlier I got 88572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, wait. Let me check. When I expanded E, I considered that the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, but actually, each time you have a layer, the exponent decreases by 1. But wait, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Let me recount. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut when I tried expanding as a sum, I thought E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19683 -1)/2 = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523, which contradicts the earlier result. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion is incorrect. Let me think again. The expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, when expanded, each 1 is multiplied by 3^(number of layers above it). Let's consider how many times each 1 is multiplied by 3.\n\nThe innermost 1 is at layer 1, and it's multiplied by 3^8 because there are 8 layers above it (including the outermost multiplication by 3). The next 1 is at layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1, which is at layer 9, multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nSo, the sum inside the parentheses is 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^0.\n\nBut wait, how many terms are there? From 3^8 down to 3^0 is 9 terms. So, the sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, E = 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier result where I computed E as 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let's check the initial step. When I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when expanding as a sum, I got E = 29523.\n\nThese are two different results, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum again.\n\nSum S = 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^0 = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen E = 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, I got E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute the sum manually to check.\n\nCompute S = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3^0 = 1\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n4 + 9 = 13\n\n13 + 27 = 40\n\n40 + 81 = 121\n\n121 + 243 = 364\n\n364 + 729 = 1093\n\n1093 + 2187 = 3280\n\n3280 + 6561 = 9841\n\nYes, so S = 9841, so E = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I ended up with E = 88572.\n\nThis suggests that I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let's go back to the step-by-step computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut according to the expansion, E should be 29523.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is wrong because it counts the number of layers incorrectly.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3...: Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3*(, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nUp to how many? Let's count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine sets of (1+3...), each starting with 1+3. So, there are nine layers. Therefore, in the step-by-step approach, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the expansion, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut these two results are conflicting. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let's check the expansion again. If E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), that sum is 9841, so E = 29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, E = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the expansion approach. Because in the step-by-step, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a different structure than the sum I considered.\n\nWait, in the expansion, I considered E = 3*(sum of 3^k from k=0 to 8), but perhaps that's incorrect because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is not the same as adding all the 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let me denote the expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but in our problem, n=9, so E_9 = 3*(1 + 3*E_8), where E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7, etc.\n\nBut in the expansion approach, I tried to represent E as 3*(sum of 3^k from k=0 to 8). But in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is different from adding all the 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me compute E_1 to E_9 using the recursive formula to see if it matches the step-by-step.\n\nE_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + 3*E_3) = 3*(1 + 3*120) = 3*361 = 1083\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't match the previous step-by-step.\n\nWait, in the initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nE = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut if I compute E_1 to E_9 recursively as E_n = 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_0 = 1, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nLet me define E_n as the value after n layers.\n\nGiven E_0 = 1 (the innermost 1)\n\nThen, E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step approach.\n\nBut when I tried expanding the expression as a sum, I got a different result. So, where was the mistake?\n\nI think the mistake was in interpreting the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. The expression is not simply a sum of 3^k; it's a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, the expansion approach was incorrect because it didn't account for the nesting properly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute E_9 using the formula for the linear recurrence.\n\nWe have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_0 = 1.\n\nThe general solution is E_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nTherefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, E_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition E_0 = 1:\n\n1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nFor n=9:\n\nE_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

The solution to this recurrence is a geometric progression where a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial condition is wrong. Wait, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, etc., as before. To solve the recurrence relation, we can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.

Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_k = A*3^k + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. Let me write it as L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_k^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

That's a recurrence relation. In general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. The general formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Then K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a few layers to check. Let's say Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So all layers check out. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So I think I've solved it correctly. I was a bit worried at first because the expression looked so nested, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. Also, recognizing the recurrence relation helped confirm the answer.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's see if that works. Let me assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Let me check if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But because it's nested, each term is added after multiplying by 3. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C =1 + 3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Let me compute a_1 to a_9: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3 and c=1. So the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - k). Wait, but 1 - k would be negative here, since k=3. Let me compute it. First, a_1 = 4. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Looking at the computed layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, recursively, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. Let me recall, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n} + c/(1 - k). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is Layer 1, which is 4, but actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, if I think of the layers as a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4, then the general solution would be a_n = (4 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n} + c/(1 - k). Wait, but let me check the standard solution for linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.
