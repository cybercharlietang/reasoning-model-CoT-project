The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the first layer is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer inside the initial 3 is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each layer outside adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(1+3)\n10. Then the outermost is 3(...)\n\nWait, no. Actually, each time you have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each time you go out one, you add another layer. So, the expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3 multiplies the ninth layer. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final answer after multiplying by 3 is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again, just to be sure. Let me go through each layer step by step again, in case I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, and so on until Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say we have a similar expression with fewer layers and see if my approach gives the right answer.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers inside. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that's correct. So, my method works for this smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's do that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nEntire expression: 3*13 = 39.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct again.\n\nSo, my method is valid, and the computation for the original problem should be correct as well.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( ... ). It's 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so yes, 9 layers. So Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as above. So I think the computation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation, a formula is derived to compute the nth layer efficiently. Applying this formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern that allows me to compute it without expanding each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine layers), expanding step by step is feasible. Another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, each term is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression both lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for this. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me consider the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. To solve this, we can write it as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find another way to compute this without going through each layer, but I think the step-by-step method is solid here. Each layer builds on the previous one, and the formula confirms that the 9th layer is 29524, so multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have a term defined recursively as x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*r^{n} + C, where r is the common ratio, and C is a constant. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. First, let's write the homogeneous equation: x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = A*3^{n} + C. Now, we need to find A and C such that the equation holds. Plugging into the recurrence: x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3C = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3C. So, we have A*3^{n} + C = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3C. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition x_1 = 4. So, when n=1: x_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed layer by layer. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, which gave me 29524 for the innermost expression before the outermost multiplication. 3. Multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. As a check, I used the recurrence relation approach to derive a formula, which confirmed the result. So, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach to see if I can find a pattern or a formula, which might help verify my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, using the formula, a_9=29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of exponents without computing each layer. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we found a general formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer is indeed 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is only 9, it's probably faster to compute each step as I did before. Let me check if the numbers I got make sense. Let me compute a few layers again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Starting from a1: 4 a2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) a3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) a4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) a5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify this multiplication once more to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048 (since 29524*2 = 59048) Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572.

Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each term is following a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where n starts at 2, and L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. In this case, it's Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. Wait, actually, it's Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, which can be rewritten as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.

So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, using the formula, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step was manageable, albeit a bit tedious. I think I've double-checked my work, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a linear recurrence here. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. However, since each term is added before multiplying, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but the recurrence relation approach worked well. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of terms where each term is 3^k, but given the structure, it's probably better to stick with the recurrence relation method. Either way, both approaches lead me to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})$.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for example, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by: a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n - 1} Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrence relations. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + a_1*r^{n - 1} when r \u2260 1. In our case, r = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + a_1*(3)^{n - 1} = (1)/(-2) + a_1*(3)^{n - 1}. But wait, our initial term a_1 is 4, right? Because a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So plugging that in: a_n = (-1/2) + 4*(3)^{n - 1}. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (-1/2) + 4*(3)^{0} = (-1/2) + 4*1 = (-1/2) + 4 = 3.5. But wait, our a_1 is actually 4, not 3.5. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me double-check the standard solution for such recurrences. The general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is: a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n - 1}. Let me apply that. So, c = 1, r = 3, a_1 = 4. Therefore, a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + (4 - (1)/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n - 1} = (1)/(-2) + (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n - 1} = (-1/2) + (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n - 1} = (-1/2) + (9/2) * 3^{n - 1}. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{0} = (-1/2) + (9/2)*1 = (-1/2) + (9/2) = (8/2) = 4. That's correct. For n=2: a_2 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{1} = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3 = (-1/2) + (27/2) = (26/2) = 13. Correct again. For n=3: a_3 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{2} = (-1/2) + (9/2)*9 = (-1/2) + (81/2) = (80/2) = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{8}. Let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*6561. Let me compute (9/2)*6561. 9 * 6561 = 59049, then divide by 2: 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. So, a_9 = (-1/2) + 29524.5 = (-0.5) + 29524.5 = 29524. So, that's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. For example, let's compute a_4 using the formula: a_4 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{3} = (-1/2) + (9/2)*27 = (-1/2) + (243/2) = (242/2) = 121. Which is correct as per my earlier step-by-step calculation. Similarly, a_5 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^4 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*81 = (-1/2) + (729/2) = (728/2) = 364. Correct again. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in this process, but let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate. 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Computed each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time substituting the previous result into the next layer. 3. Arrived at Layer 9 being 29524. 4. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result, 88572. 5. Then, to cross-verify, I used the recurrence relation approach, derived a closed-form formula, and confirmed that a_9 is indeed 29524, leading again to the same final result. 6. Tested the formula with lower layers to ensure its correctness, which it passed. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a particular mathematical pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which might help in computing it more efficiently, especially for a larger number of layers. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. Since 3^10 is 59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. So whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recursion. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, in this case, Layer 1 is 4, so maybe the recurrence starts at n=1. Let me define a_n as the value of Layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.

Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's check that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. We know that L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is given by L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this without computing each layer or using the formula. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, though that might take longer. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Starting with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recursive formula, or expanding the expression step by step\u2014the result is 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, without using the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression. But since I already have the formula, it's a good way to check my work. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers (only 9), computing each step is manageable. But just for understanding, let's see if we can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assuming a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but maybe it works. Then the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, solving the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So the formula seems correct. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which confirms our earlier result.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The standard form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r-1))*(r^n - 1), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution is A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying initial conditions. Let's say a_1 = 4, which is the first layer. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Because (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time. But since I was doing it step by step, computing each layer manually also worked. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific formula. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value at the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or have a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting with a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9. So, in general, an = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for an. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is an = c + r*a(n-1), where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is an = (c/(1 - r)) + (a1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^(n-1). Let me check if that's correct. The homogeneous solution is when c = 0, so an = a1 * r^(n-1). The particular solution is when an is a constant, say A. Then A = c + r*A, so A - r*A = c => A(1 - r) = c => A = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is an = homogeneous + particular = A*r^(n) + B. Wait, maybe I should think again. The standard approach is to solve the recurrence an = r*an-1 + c. The solution is an = r^(n) * a0 + c*(r^(n) - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a1 is 4, and the recurrence is an = 3*an-1 + 1. Wait, no, actually, an = 1 + 3*an-1, which is an = 3*an-1 + 1. So, yes, that's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard solution is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is an = 3*an-1, which has the solution an^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution an^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, an = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^(9+1) = 3^10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, since an = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out.

Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set a_n = a_{n-1} when n approaches infinity, but that might not be straightforward here. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added constant each time. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrences. The general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. To find D, we set a_n = a_{n-1} = D, so D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster or reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the overall expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9, then multiplying by 3. Now, this recursive relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term (the +1) is zero, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the overall expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula\u2014the result is 88572.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, L_9 is (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression is essentially a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But since it's nested, it's a bit different. However, using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression seems to have worked. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see. The recursion here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a simple geometric series. But since we've already derived the formula for a_n, it's more straightforward to use that. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recursive formula.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_{n+1} - 3*a_n = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our expression has 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^{10} = 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's a linear recursion where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n, where n goes from 1 to 9, and the final result is 3*a_9. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into this form. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} becomes A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, I get 88572. I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let's see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b. Here, a = 3, b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(1) - b/(a-1)) * a^(n-1) + b/(a-1). Let me plug in the values. L(1) = 4, a = 3, b = 1. So, L(n) = (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^(n-1) + 1/(3-1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^(n-1) + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^(n-1) + 1/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (7/2)*3^(8) + 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, (7/2)*6561 = (7*6561)/2. Let's compute 7*6561: 6561*7: 6000*7=42000, 500*7=3500, 60*7=420, 1*7=7. So total is 42000 + 3500 = 45500, +420=45920, +7=45927. So (7/2)*6561 = 45927 / 2 = 22963.5. Then, adding 1/2: 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964. Wait, but earlier I got L(9) as 29524. There's a discrepancy here. That means either my step-by-step calculation was wrong, or my formula is incorrect. Let me check where I might have gone wrong. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. The formula for L(n) is L(n) = (L(1) - b/(a-1)) * a^(n-1) + b/(a-1). Here, L(1) = 4, a=3, b=1. So, plugging in, it's (4 - 1/2)*3^(n-1) + 1/2. So for n=9, that's (7/2)*3^8 + 1/2. As above, 3^8=6561. So, (7/2)*6561 = (7*6561)/2 = 45927/2=22963.5, plus 0.5 is 22964. But in my step-by-step, I got L(9)=29524. That's a big difference. So, one of them must be wrong. Let me see where I made the mistake. Wait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the recurrence starts at n=1, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, etc., up to Layer9. So, if n=1 corresponds to Layer1, then n=9 corresponds to Layer9. So, using the formula, L(9) = (7/2)*3^8 +1/2=22964. But according to my step-by-step, it's 29524. Which is correct? Let me check my step-by-step again, maybe I messed up the layers. Let me recount: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Yes, that's correct. So, why does the formula give a different result? Let me check the formula again. The standard formula for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^(n) * L(0) + b*(a^(n) -1)/(a-1). Wait, maybe I used the wrong initial condition. If L(1)=4, then perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Let me derive the formula properly. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4. So, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution is L_p(n) = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2. So, L(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Yes! That matches my step-by-step calculation. So, the formula was correct, but I misapplied it earlier. I had used L(n)= (7/2)*3^(n-1) +1/2, but the correct formula is L(n)= (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2=29524. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, since L(n)= (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L(9)= 3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without going through each layer. But either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Then 3*29524 = 88572, as before. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can recognize it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => Subtract 3*a_p from both sides: -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could also compute each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and both methods led me to the same answer.

Therefore, I computed up to Layer9 correctly, getting 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, the value at layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute it directly without computing each layer, I could use the formula for a9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and verified it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a linear recurrence, so the formula approach is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we used.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check the layers again to be thorough. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1)=4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, and so on, up to L(9)=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9). Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see: The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L(n) = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. If I expand it all the way, how many terms would there be? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, if there are nine layers, then expanding it would give me 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but maybe it's a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, and the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer can be expressed as 1 + 3*previous value. But perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: If I have n layers, then the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with n layers. Let me see for n=1: E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. For n=2: E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, for n=1 (Layer 1), the value was 4, and for n=2 (Layer 2), it was 13, and the outer expression would be 3*13=39. Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the number of multiplications by 3 is 9. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the number of layers with the number of terms. Let me think again. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula we found earlier: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if it can be expressed as a sum. Let me write out the expression without the 3 multiplier at the beginning: Let me denote S as the innermost expression: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, S is the innermost 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around it. Wait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*S, where S is the expression with nine layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding S step by step:\n\nS = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand the innermost part first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, S = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*S = 88572. Alternatively, if I consider each step as adding another term in a geometric series, perhaps I can find a pattern. Let me see:\n\nEach time we compute a layer, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I write out the terms:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3*1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\n...\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nNow, let's see if these numbers relate to powers of 3:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nNow, looking at the sequence:\n\n4 = (3^2 + 1)/2 = (9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5? Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, earlier we had L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=1, L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, each L(n) is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine 1s. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, expanding it would give me 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Let me see how that would expand:\n\nEach 1 is multiplied by 3^(number of layers beyond it). So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, let me think: If I have nine layers, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, etc., down to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum would be 3*(1*3^8 + 1*3^7 + 1*3^6 + ... + 1*3^0). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that doesn't match our earlier result. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of terms.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, the innermost 1 is at layer 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, up to the first 1 being multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is 9 terms. So, sum = (3^9 -1)/(3-1)=19682/2=9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523. But that's not matching the earlier result of 88572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me try again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as E9 = 1 + 3. Then, E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, up to E0 = 3*E1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps the number of terms is different.\n\nWait, in our initial computation, we found that E9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*E9=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, when I tried to model it as a sum, I got 3*9841=29523, which is different. So, perhaps my mistake was in the way I'm counting the layers. Let me try to see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the expression, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire inner expression, which has nine layers. So, perhaps the inner expression is E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), with eight layers inside. Wait, but in our initial computation, we had nine layers, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is nine, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the entire expression inside the outermost 3. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I tried to model it as a sum, I considered the innermost 1 as being multiplied by 3^8, but perhaps that's not accurate. Let me see:\n\nIf I have nine layers, each 1 is at a different depth. The innermost 1 is at depth 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8 when it reaches the outermost layer. The next 1 is at depth 8, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the first 1 at depth 1, multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is 9 terms. So, sum = (3^9 -1)/(3-1)=19682/2=9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523. But that's conflicting with our initial computation of 88572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning nine layers. So, the innermost is the ninth layer, which is 1+3. Then, each layer wraps around that. So, when we compute each layer from 1 to 9, we get Layer9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nBut when I tried to model it as a sum, I got a different result. So, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm interpreting the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be written as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), with nine 3s inside. Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if there are nine layers, each with a 1 and a 3, then perhaps the sum is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. So, each layer adds a 1 and a 3, except the innermost, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, when I tried to model it as a sum, I considered the innermost 1 being multiplied by 3^8, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me see:\n\nEach time we go up a layer, the 1 is multiplied by an additional factor of 3. So, the innermost 1 is at Layer9, and when it reaches Layer1, it's multiplied by 3^8. Similarly, the next 1 is at Layer8, so when it reaches Layer1, it's multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the first 1 at Layer1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the sum would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, E=3*9841=29523, which is different from our step-by-step computation. So, there must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not including the outermost 3 correctly. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the inner expression is S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and E=3*S. So, S itself is a sum that includes the innermost 1s multiplied by appropriate powers of 3.\n\nWait, but in our step-by-step computation, S=29524, so E=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, when I tried to compute S as sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, I got S=9841, which is different. So, perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that in the expression S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), the number of terms isn't nine, but rather eight. Let me see: If I have nine layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, the number of 1s is nine, each multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model S as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9 terms, so sum = (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, E=3*9841=29523. But that's conflicting with our step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, no, in our step-by-step computation, we found that Layer9=29524, and E=3*29524=88572. So, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, my approach to model it as a sum is flawed. Let me see where.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which isn't the same as adding another term in the sum. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so it's a linear recurrence, not a simple sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, for example, Layer1=4=1+3.\n\nLayer2=1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer3=1 + 3*13=40.\n\nWhich is different from summing 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^8. Because 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 6561= (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nBut in our case, Layer9=29524, which is much larger. So, that suggests that the two approaches are different.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach of computing each layer step by step is correct, and the sum approach was incorrect because the layers are defined by a recurrence relation, not a simple addition of powers of 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid now. I've double-checked each layer, and the closed-form formula confirms that Layer9=29524, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive formula. Maybe I can model this with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, in this case, we have 9 layers, which would correspond to a_9. So, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of a_1, using the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: If I expand the entire expression, it might look like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But since each term is nested, it's a bit tricky. However, using the formula I derived earlier, I can directly compute it without expanding each layer. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I were to write the entire expression out, it would be a sum of powers of 3, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Let me try to see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost layer: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, when you expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If we expand all the layers, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to 3^9, but actually, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, maybe it's better to model it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. But since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's more like a recursive geometric series. So, using the formula I derived earlier is the most efficient way. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can determine that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).
