    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, correct. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution would be based on the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Up until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, but in the expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3's after each 1+. Let me see: Starting from the inside, the first 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time we have another 1+3(...), so each layer adds another 3(...). So, in the given expression, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs as a separate term. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each time, we have another 1+3(...) until we reach the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it is 1+3(...). Each time, we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs as a separate term. The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(1+3)\nLayer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(...9 times...))\n\nSo, in the given expression, how many layers are there? The outermost expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1+3*(...). Each time, it's another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) inside.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each subsequent 1+3 is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one until Layer 9. So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost, so the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, using our formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, and then multiply by 3, since the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer outward.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Each layer a_n can be represented by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost layer a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find the formula for the nth layer: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Number of Layers**: The expression has 9 layers. Thus, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\n5. **Compute a_9**: Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Final Expression**: The entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, to find a_9, I can compute each term step by step, which I did. Alternatively, I can look for a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to derive that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. Let me assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, when expanded, the entire expression would be a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand it step by step. Let me denote the innermost term as T1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nT3 = 1 + 3*T2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nT4 = 1 + 3*T3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nT5 = 1 + 3*T4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nT6 = 1 + 3*T5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nT7 = 1 + 3*T6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nT8 = 1 + 3*T7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nT9 = 1 + 3*T8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of it as a geometric series, each time we're adding 1 and then scaling by 3. So, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see. Let's consider that each layer adds a term. So, starting from the innermost, T1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, T3 = 1 + 3*T2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nIf I keep expanding, each Tn = 1 + 3*T_{n-1}.\n\nSo, after expanding all layers, the expression becomes:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWhich, when fully expanded, would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nBut this seems too involved. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check if I can model this as a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, as I found earlier. Plugging in the initial condition, we found A=3/2 and B=-1/2, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, perhaps when we expand the entire expression, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))...), which is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, but that might not be exactly correct because each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, so it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*previous sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the total sum is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But this is an infinite series, but in our case, it's finite with 9 layers. So, maybe the sum is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Wait, because each layer adds 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, so the sum would be (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to arrive at the same result.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, the first term a=1, ratio r=3, number of terms n=10 (from k=0 to 9). So, S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the geometric series sum formula, I arrive at the same final result: 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, checking my work, and using different methods to arrive at the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a form of a geometric progression. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of computing each layer. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. So, either way, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my computations for any possible arithmetic errors. Starting with the layers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Each step seems correct. 3*4=12+1=13; 3*13=39+1=40; 3*40=120+1=121; 3*121=363+1=364; 3*364=1092+1=1093; 3*1093=3279+1=3280; 3*3280=9840+1=9841; 3*9841=29523+1=29524. Yes, that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3^{11}=177147, minus 3 is 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So both methods confirm the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find it equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1.

    "text": ". Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n - 1} }, but wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 is given as 4, so maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me check the standard solution again. For a recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form solution is a_n = r^{n - 1} * a_1 + c*(r^{n - 1} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me verify that. Let's test for n=1: a_1 = r^{0} * a_1 + c*(r^{0} - 1)/(r - 1) = 1*a_1 + c*(1 - 1)/(r - 1) = a_1 + 0 = a_1. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = r^{1}*a_1 + c*(r^{1} - 1)/(r - 1) = r*a_1 + c*(r - 1)/(r - 1) = r*a_1 + c. Which matches the recurrence a_2 = r*a_1 + c. Good. So, applying this to our problem, where r=3, c=1, and a_1=4. Therefore, a_n = 3^{n - 1} * 4 + 1*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. Let me simplify this expression: a_n = 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. Let's combine the terms: To add these, I can express 4*3^{n - 1} as (8*3^{n - 1})/2. So, a_n = (8*3^{n - 1} + 3^{n - 1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. Wait, because 8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} = 9*3^{n-1}. So, a_n = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. Alternatively, since 9 is 3^2, this can be written as (3^{2} * 3^{n - 1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3^{2} * 3^{n - 1} = 3^{2 + n - 1} = 3^{n + 1}. So, yes, a_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n + 1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => Subtract 3C: -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), L(1)=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, L(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another power of 3. If I expand it, it might be a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if it's a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost part as S. Let me compute S step by step, but I think I already did that with the layers. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) but with a finite number of terms. Since there are nine layers, it's a finite geometric series. Let me try to express it as such. Let me denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4=13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2=40, etc., as before. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which we already solved as a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another 3, so the total number of terms would be nine, but each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 8, but multiplied by 3 outside. Wait, let me think. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds a new term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4=13, which can be written as 1 + 3*1 + 3*3, but no, that's not exactly right. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer adds a new power of 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try to write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) but this seems to go in circles. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that each layer adds a term of 3^k, starting from k=0. Let me try to expand E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me start expanding from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the inside out. I correctly identified each layer and computed each step carefully, verifying each result as I went along. Then, I noticed a pattern and tried to find a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, which worked out. I applied the formula to find a_9 and then multiplied by 3, confirming the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is just 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each time, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. Particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using the derived formula for each layer, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29,524.

Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a mathematical formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L(9)) = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 )= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be seen as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + something. Wait, let me see. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, since I have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple methods: step-by-step computation of each layer, solving the recurrence relation, and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524, and then the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, except for the constant term 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid.

Wait, maybe it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can model this.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.

Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute each layer again just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time I compute it. So I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric series, and the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Since 3^{10} is 59049, subtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So that's another way to see it.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication for Layer 9:\n\n3 * 9841: 9841 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I'm dealing with only nine terms, it's probably faster to compute each step as I did. But just for knowledge, let's see if I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, as I did earlier. It's a good exercise in both methods: step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Either way, the answer comes out to be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say d. Then substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = 3^n * C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^n)*(3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For Layer 1: n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.

Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, no, because L(1) is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We know that L(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Now, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). So, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L(9) =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, maybe this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could make this easier. Each layer seems to be following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it to see if we can find a formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine layers), computing each step manually seems feasible and less error-prone. Let me check if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The general formula for such a nested expression can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part would be L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, with characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let me assume L_p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. Let's see, when n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.

Let me think: If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. Then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

So, each layer follows the formula a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. Now, if I wanted to find a closed-form expression for a_n, I could solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, c=3, d=1, and a_0=4. Wait, but actually, the initial term is a_1=4, so maybe the index starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1), but since a_0 is at n=1, maybe it's better to shift the index. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see: Starting from a_1 = 4. a_2 = 3*4 +1 = 12 +1 =13 a_3 = 3*13 +1 = 39 +1 =40 a_4 = 3*40 +1 = 120 +1 =121 a_5 = 3*121 +1 = 363 +1 =364 a_6 = 3*364 +1 = 1092 +1 =1093 a_7 = 3*1093 +1 = 3279 +1 =3280 a_8 = 3*3280 +1 = 9840 +1 =9841 a_9 = 3*9841 +1 = 29523 +1 =29524 So, indeed, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Now, if I wanted to find a formula for a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from n=1, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which is a_3=40. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as we found before. So, using both the iterative method and the formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So the computation of each layer seems accurate. Then, the final step is multiplying 29524 by 3, which we did earlier and got 88572. Let me just do that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524. 79048 + 9000=88048, +524=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.

    "text": ". That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think: Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Now, using the general solution for n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier. So, L_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L_9), and since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Let me see. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let me assume the solution is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Also, let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, since it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, we can solve it using standard methods. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Layer 3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, it's like adding 1 and then tripling the previous total. So after n layers, the value is (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, but in our case, n=9, so it's (3^{10} -1)/2. But wait, in the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So when n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I denote the innermost part as x, then the expression becomes 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers, the formula approach is more straightforward.

    "text": ". Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as I computed. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check. Because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 1: n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. Layer 3: n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer using the formula and see if it matches. Let's say layer 4: using the formula, a_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which is exactly what I got earlier. So, the formula works, and it's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed before. Now, in general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1, and a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4). Wait, no, let me check. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, so perhaps a_0 = 1, and a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then, the closed-form solution would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=0, a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, correct. For n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. For n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, meaning that the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Wait, but let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's a_1 = 4. Then each layer adds one more, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation. So, using the formula, I can compute it more quickly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula approach. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3. Let me compute that step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, 3^10 = 59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. As before, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, so the total value after n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. But since I already verified it step by step and with the formula, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, or by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the value after 9 layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a sequence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me think. Alternatively, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Let's see, the expression is a geometric series or something similar? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, and there's an addition of 1 each time, it's similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3. So, the total number of layers is 9, but since we start at a_1, which is the innermost, up to a_9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might also help. Wait, but in this case, each term is defined as a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's more like a geometric sequence where each term depends on the previous one. So, the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation is more appropriate here. But it's good to see that both methods give the same result.

Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve the homogeneous equation first: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going up to Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly without manually calculating each layer. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. However, if the number of layers were larger, the formula would be much more efficient. In any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, that's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, then used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which confirmed my step-by-step calculation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.
