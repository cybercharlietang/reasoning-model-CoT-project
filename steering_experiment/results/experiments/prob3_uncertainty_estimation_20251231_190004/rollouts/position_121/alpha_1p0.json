    "text": " Let me check this formula with the initial layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

    "text": " Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But since a_1 =4=1 +3*1, so a_0 would be 1. Wait, actually, let's see: a_1 =1 +3*a_0=4. So, 1 +3*a_0=4 => 3*a_0=3 => a_0=1. So, then a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1. So, expanding, a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n} +3^{n+1}*a_0. But since a_0=1, then a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*1. Wait, but sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2 +3^{n+1}= (3^{n+1}-1 +2*3^{n+1})/2= (3*3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-1)/2. Wait, but that contradicts our earlier formula where a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution since it worked correctly for the first few terms. So, in any case, the closed-form formula gives us a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which we can use to compute a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just double-check the multiplication: 29524 *3. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is correct. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The closed-form expression we derived is essentially the sum of a geometric series. So, another approach is recognizing it as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum. But since we've already confirmed it with two methods, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the first 1+3(...), each subsequent one is inside the previous. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each layer adds another. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around it with another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, our earlier calculation of a_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 =4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps the initial term is a_0=1? Let me check. If we set a_0=1, then a_1=1 + 3*a_0=1 +3*1=4, which matches. Then, the general formula for a geometric series with ratio 3 and n terms would be a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is what we had earlier. So, yes, that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
