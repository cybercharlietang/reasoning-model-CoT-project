Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer manually, which is what I did first. But it's good to know that there's a pattern here that can be expressed with a formula, which can save time for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's feasible to compute each one step by step. Either way, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid.

For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Alternatively, since the outer expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Then layer 2 is a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. Similarly, layer 3 is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, I could compute this using exponents. Since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier and an additive constant. The formula I derived earlier is a standard solution for such linear recurrences, so it's a reliable method. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.
