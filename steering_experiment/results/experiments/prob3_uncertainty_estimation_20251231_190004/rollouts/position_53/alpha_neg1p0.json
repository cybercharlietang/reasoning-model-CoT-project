    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, actually, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nWait, but 29524 has digits: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nThen 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nThen 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nThen 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nThen 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nThen 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 877572? Wait, let me check again. Let's write it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n? \n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover: 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7, carryover: 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover: 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands digit: 7, carryover: 0.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27. Ten-thousands digit: 7, carryover: 2.\n\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Hundred-thousands digit: 8, carryover: 0.\n\nSo, writing it all together from the last carryover to the first digit: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. So the result is 877572. Wait, but let me verify that with a calculator because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me try another approach. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572, not 877572. I must have messed up the digit positions earlier. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 * 29524 should be 88572. Let me confirm each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me recount because the expression has multiple layers, and I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3\n2. (1+3\n3. (1+3\n4. (1+3\n5. (1+3\n6. (1+3\n7. (1+3\n8. (1+3\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, but each layer is one more than the previous. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, the next is (1+3*(Layer 1)), which is Layer 2.\n\nThen, (1+3*(Layer 2)) is Layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nSo, in total, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n10. The outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that's actually 10 layers? Or is it 9 layers? Wait, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the outermost. Let me recount the parentheses. Each (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, up to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3).\n\nThen, moving out, each layer wraps around the previous one, so the next is (1+3*(1+3)), then (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), etc. So, the number of layers is 9, each adding another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(...), where ... is a 9-layer expression.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to compute 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1+3=4, then each next layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, but earlier, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, let's list each layer again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Because each layer seems to be growing exponentially, so 3^9 might be involved here, but perhaps I should check each step again.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLet me check Layer 5: 3*Layer 4 is 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364=1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093=3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280=9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841=29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is this the right approach? Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach aligns with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me see: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, the first 3 is outside, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 2, then inside that, 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 3, and so on until the innermost Layer 9. So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify that because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me see. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression.

So yes, 87572. So the final result is 87,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Wait, no, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, 87,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88,572. Wait, now I'm confused because two different methods are giving me two different results. Hmm, that can't be right. Where did I go wrong? Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, 9+9=18, 2+2=4. So, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, adding another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add digit by digit: 8+4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. 9+ nothing=9. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88,572. So that's correct. But earlier, when I did 29524 * 3 by digits, I got 87,572. That's inconsistent. So where did I make the mistake? Let me do it again step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that's 87,572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check which one is correct. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's 88,572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have miscounted the digits or missed a carry-over. So, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just go through the layers again to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct now. I think I just made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, probably misaligning the digits or missing a carry-over. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we've already computed it step by step. But just for fun, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a number that's one less than a power of 3. For example, a_1=4= (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. a_2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Similarly, a_3=40=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. So, in general, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*(59048/2)= (3*59048)/2= 177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, to double-check, maybe I can compute it using a different approach. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, actually, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result.

I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check again. So, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute each digit step by step:\n\n- The units digit: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- Next digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Next digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- Next digit (thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Next digit (ten-thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n- Finally, the hundred-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try adding the parts again: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000; 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now, adding them step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit, I got 87572. I must have messed up the digit places in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try that again carefully.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the digits are 8 7 5 7 2.

Wait, that's different from my initial digit-by-digit approach. I think I misaligned the digits earlier. So, the correct multiplication is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it digit by digit before, I thought it was 87572, but that must have been a mistake. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.

So the result is 87572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 87572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because if one layer is wrong, it will throw off all the subsequent layers. Let's check each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, it might be more efficient to find a formula or recognize a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the recurrence relation and solving it. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, either method works. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, each subsequent layer builds on that, and finally, the entire expression evaluates to 87572 when multiplied by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 87572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{87572}\n\\]"

There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in my multiplication. Let me check the addition method again: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my initial multiplication was wrong. I must have miscounted the digits or carried over incorrectly. So, the correct final answer is 88572. Let me go back and see where I went wrong in the multiplication. When I did 29524 * 3, I think I might have shifted the digits incorrectly. Let's write it down properly:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x    3\n  ________\n    88572\n```\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So the result is 88572? Wait, no, wait. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nThere are no more digits, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. This seems like a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. It's reassuring to see that both the iterative step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of a geometric progression. Let me explore that.\n\nFrom the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, we can expand it all the way to a_1:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1.\n\nBut wait, actually, since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, we can see that each term adds another power of 3 multiplied by the initial term.\n\nWait, let me think again. If we unroll the recurrence, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*a_1)...)))\n\nWhich can be expanded as a sum of 3^k terms. Specifically, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, substituting, we get:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*(1 + 3).\n\nSum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so it equals (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nThen, 3^n*(1 + 3) = 3^n*4 = 4*3^n.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n -1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier we had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the same as (3*3^n -1)/2, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, that's consistent with the previous result.\n\nWait, but in my current approach, I have a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. But a_1 is 4, so that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let's try expanding a_n step by step:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nIf I try to express a_n as a sum, let's see:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, because each time you unroll a layer, you add another term with a higher power of 3.\n\nSo, for a_2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, for a_2, we have sum up to 3^2, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is correct. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis again confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could also compute this using exponentiation by squaring or other methods, but since 3^10 is manageable, it's straightforward to compute it directly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 +1 =13\n\nLayer 3:3*13 +1=40\n\nLayer 4:3*40 +1=121\n\nLayer 5:3*121 +1=364\n\nLayer 6:3*364 +1=1093\n\nLayer 7:3*1093 +1=3280\n\nLayer 8:3*3280 +1=9841\n\nLayer 9:3*9841 +1=29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each layer is indeed 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, whether it's expanding each layer step by step, using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, I consistently arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles and each time the result is consistent. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - Final Result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carryover 2, write 7. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 87572. Therefore, the final result is 87572. But wait, let me check my earlier layers again because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 87572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, our a_1 is 4, which is the base case. Wait, maybe I should adjust the indices. Let me think again. Let me consider that a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=87572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, though a bit more time-consuming. But since I only had nine layers, it was manageable. I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the expression or using another mathematical technique. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. If I expand it, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, expanding it would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine 1's. Each time, you're adding another 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding E, we can write it as: E = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. Wait, is that correct? Let me check with a smaller number of layers. Suppose there's only one layer: E = 3*(1) = 3. If I expand it, it's 3*1 =3. If there are two layers: E =3*(1 + 3*(1))=3*(1+3)=3*4=12. Expanding it: 3*1 + 3^2*1=3 +9=12. Correct. Three layers: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1)))=3*(1 +3*(4))=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Expanding: 3*1 +3^2*1 +3^3*1=3 +9 +27=39. Correct. So, in general, for n layers, E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^{n}. So, in our case, n=9, so E =3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561 +19683. Let me compute that sum. Let's compute each term:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nNow, summing them up:\n\n3 + 9 =12\n\n12 +27=39\n\n39 +81=120\n\n120 +243=363\n\n363 +729=1092\n\n1092 +2187=3279\n\n3279 +6561=9840\n\n9840 +19683=29523\n\nWait, but that sum is 29523, but earlier, when I computed E, it was 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no. Wait, in the expansion, E = sum_{k=1 to 9} 3^k = (3^{10} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. So, E=29523. But earlier, I thought E=3*a_9=87572. Wait, that can't be. There's a confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I expanded it, I considered E = sum_{k=1 to 9} 3^k, which equals 29523. But in the earlier approach, I had a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=87572. That can't both be true. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's go back. When I used the recursive approach, I had a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4, and ended up with a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut when I expanded the expression, I got E=29523.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. The initial problem is: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 +3*(...). So, the number of 1's is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1's in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, for nine layers, how many 1's are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1 +3\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, each layer adds one more 1. So, the total number of 1's is nine. Therefore, when expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine 1's.\n\nWait, but in my earlier expansion, I thought of it as E=sum_{k=1 to 9}3^k=29523. But according to the recursive approach, E=3*a_9=87572, where a_9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm defining E. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the expansion approach, if I have E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers, then E =3*1 +3^2*1 +3^3*1 +...+3^9*1. That's a geometric series from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k. The sum is (3^{10} -3)/2=29523.\n\nBut in the recursive approach, I defined a_1=4, a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=87572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute E both ways with a smaller number of layers to see which approach is correct.\n\nCase 1: n=1. The expression is 3*(1). So, E=3. According to the expansion method, sum from k=1 to 1 of 3^k=3. Correct. According to the recursive method: a_1=1 +3=4, then E=3*a_1=12. Wait, that's a problem because when n=1, the expression is just 3*(1)=3, but the recursive method gives 12. So, clearly, the recursive method is overcounting.\n\nWait, so perhaps the confusion is in how I'm defining the layers. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 +3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 1 +3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1:1 +3. Then Layer 2:1 +3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9:1 +3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in this case, the number of 1's is nine, but the number of multiplications by 3 is also nine, but the exponents go up to 3^9.\n\nWait, but when I did the expansion earlier, I thought of E= sum_{k=1 to 9}3^k=29523, but according to the recursive approach, E=3*a_9=87572. But when n=1, the expansion gives 3, while the recursive approach gives 12, which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the expansion approach is correct, and the recursive approach was misapplied.\n\nWait, so perhaps I misapplied the recursive approach. Let me think again.\n\nIf I define a_n as the value of the nth layer, where each layer is 1 +3*(...), then:\n\na_1=1 +3=4\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40\n\n...\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8\n\nBut the entire expression is E=3*a_9. So, for n=1, the expression is 3*a_1=3*4=12, but the actual expression when n=1 is 3*(1)=3. So, there's a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when n=1, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)), but the innermost part is just 1 +3, so a_1=4, but the entire expression is 3*a_1=12, but the actual expression should be 3*(1 +3)=12. So, that's correct. Wait, but if n=1, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with one layer. So, it's 3*(1 +3*(1)). Wait, no. Wait, when n=1, it's just 3*(1 +3*(1)), which is 3*(4)=12. But if n=1, is the innermost layer just 1 +3? Or is it 1 +3*(1)? Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers corresponds to the number of times 1 +3*(...) is nested. So, for n=1, it's 3*(1 +3*(1)). So, two layers: the outermost 3*(...) and the innermost (1 +3*(1)). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original problem has nine opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, for n=9 layers. Each layer is 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost layer is 1 +3, then each layer wraps around that. So, when I compute a_1=4, a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut when I expand the expression, I get E=sum_{k=1 to 9}3^k=29523, which is different. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's take n=2. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3)). Compute it directly: Innermost:1 +3=4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Alternatively, expanding: 3*1 +3^2*1=3 +9=12. But the actual value is 39, which is different. So, the expansion approach is wrong. Therefore, the expansion approach isn't applicable here because each layer is not just adding another 3^k, but rather each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to a different result.\n\nTherefore, the recursive approach is the correct way to compute this, leading to E=87572.\n\nWait, but why did the expansion approach fail? Because when I expand the expression, I assumed that each layer adds a term 3^k, but in reality, each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which leads to a different progression. So, the expansion approach isn't a direct sum of powers of 3, but rather a recursive multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the recursive one, leading to E=87572.\n\nBut let me double-check with n=2. Compute E directly: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3)). Innermost:1+3=4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Now, using the recursive formula: a_1=4, a_2=1 +3*a_1=13, E=3*a_2=39. Correct. Now, using the expansion approach: E=3 +9=12, which is wrong. So, expansion approach is incorrect. Therefore, the recursive approach is the right way.\n\nSo, going back, with n=9 layers, we have a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=87572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 87572.\n\nI think that's solid now. I considered both approaches, found that the expansion approach didn't align with the direct computation for smaller n, so the recursive approach is the correct method here. Thus, the answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recursively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value follows a pattern. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer recursively**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 87572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{87572}$"

So yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me double-check the layers because 29524 seems a bit high, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the number is so large. Maybe I should try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 4*3 +1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 13*3 +1\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29,524, as I computed earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication once again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7. Write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n9 *3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, the 2 (from 29,524) is actually the ten-thousands place, which is 2*10,000. So, 2*3=6 + carryover 2=8. So, write down 8.\n\nPutting it all together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2=88,572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but when I multiplied 29524 \u00d7 3, I think I missed a digit. Let me count the digits: 29524 has 5 digits, so when multiplied by 3, it should have either 5 or 6 digits. The result I got is 87572, which is 5 digits. Let me verify: 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct multiplication is 88572, not 87572. Let me redo the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2\u00d73+2) 7 (from 9\u00d73) 7 (from 5\u00d73+1) 7 (from 2\u00d73+1) 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that would be 87772, which doesn't match. I'm confused now. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should do the multiplication digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Wait, but earlier when I did the addition method, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3 times each:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the correct result should be 88572, not 87572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit, I think I missed a digit or misplaced a number. Let me try again carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (2): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (5): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (2): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (9): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (2): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, but the number is 29524, so the digits from right to left are 4, 2, 5, 2, 9, 2. Wait, that's six digits? No, 29524 is five digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply, I should go through each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Wait, no, carry is from the previous step, which was 15, so carry over 1. So 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28? Wait, no, that's not right. The carry is added to the next digit's multiplication. So, after 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, we write 5 and carry over 1. Then, moving to the thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 makes 28. So we write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\nNext, ten thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would make the number 88572, right? Because the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten thousands: 8\n\nSo the number is 88572. That matches the earlier addition method. So I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit calculation by not correctly handling the thousands place. So, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using a different approach. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me go back and check if I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the earlier layers, which would throw off the final result. Let's go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

    "text": " 3 * 2 (since the next digit is 3 in 29524? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 8, 7, 8, 7, 2. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 8 (from the first digit), then 7, 8, 7, 2? Wait, no, that would be 87872, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 +1 = 8.\n\n2 + 0 = 2.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so that contradicts my earlier step-by-step multiplication. Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me check my initial multiplication again.\n\nStarting with 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, but that would be 27588, which is incorrect because 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nAh, I see my mistake now. When writing the digits, I was writing them from left to right, but in multiplication, you start from the right. So, the first digit written is the units place, then tens, etc. So, the correct way is:\n\nAfter computing each digit:\n\n- Units: 2\n\n- Tens: 7\n\n- Hundreds: 5\n\n- Thousands: 8\n\n- Ten-thousands: 8\n\nBut since we have a carryover in the ten-thousands place, we need to add it. Wait, no, 2*3=6, plus carryover 2 is 8, so that's the ten-thousands place. So, the number is 88,572. So, it's 88,572. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, so my initial step-by-step was correct, but when I wrote the digits down, I misaligned them. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I don't want to make a mistake here. Let me add 29,524 three times:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\n59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048\n\n79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, going back, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29,524. So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I correctly computed Layer 9. Because if I messed up any of the layers before, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go back through each layer step by step to confirm.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Therefore, 3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression, which might help confirm my result. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + r*(...))) with n layers. In this case, a = 1, r = 3, and n = 9. The value of such an expression can be calculated recursively, which is exactly what I did earlier. Alternatively, it can be expressed as (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but this isn't exactly a geometric series; it's a nested multiplication. Let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, we can solve it iteratively. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_k. The recurrence relation can be written as L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_k^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k layers, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's see, 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So putting it all together: 87, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just do the multiplication step by step. Let me write it down as if I'm multiplying:\n\n    29524\n  x     3\n  --------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2, but wait, that seems off. Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, 29524 has 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 (thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 (hundred thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when we multiply, we should only have 5 digits. Let me write it correctly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 9 + nothing=9. So 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems right, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches my earlier result. So, that's reassuring.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when doing this step by step. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 87572. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using a different method or see if there's a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9, then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is a1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 87572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 87572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation confirms the result obtained through step-by-step computation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Hmm, same result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But wait, when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me check that again because 9841 * 3 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, that's correct. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Calculating each layer step by step leads us to the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to yield the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, so that's 88,572. Wait, earlier I thought it was 87,572. I must have made a mistake in the digit places. Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572. But when I did the other method, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct. Let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's 88,572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. That suggests I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me check again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but according to the other method, it's 88,572. There's a conflict here. Let me add 29524 three times to see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. Probably, I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7    3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the expression step by step again, maybe using another approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds a term where it's 1 + 3 times the previous total. So, if I think of this as a recursive sequence, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the answer. As I computed earlier, a_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the computations. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. The ninth layer computes to 29,524.\n5. Multiply this result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so that's 87572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572, but let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a bit. When I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but considering the layers, it's plausible. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count them: Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 (layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, each time, it's 1+3*(...), so layers 2 through 9. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, yes, layer 9 is the outermost one before the initial 3. So, 3*(layer 9). So, if layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L(1) = 4. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3L(n-1) = 0, which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L(5) = (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L(9)=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*L(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer can be seen as a term in a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on might have saved time, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, both methods lead to the same answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier. Let me see if each layer follows a certain sequence. Looking at the results for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each term is roughly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let's check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 * 3 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13 * 3 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 3 to Layer 4: 40 * 3 + 1 = 121. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 4 to Layer 5: 121 * 3 + 1 = 364. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 5 to Layer 6: 364 * 3 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 6 to Layer 7: 1093 * 3 + 1 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 7 to Layer 8: 3280 * 3 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 8 to Layer 9: 9841 * 3 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems to hold true. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, for n=1 to 9, a_9 would be the value at Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the total expression is a sum of 3^k terms. But perhaps that's overcomplicating it since I've already found the answer using the recurrence relation. But just to explore, let me try to expand the expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me try to see if expanding the expression would help. Let's denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on up to E9. Then, the total expression is 3*E9. But this is essentially the same approach as before, just using different notation. So, perhaps the recurrence approach is the most straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a form of a number in base 3 or something, but that might not be necessary here. Given that I've already computed the answer step by step and confirmed it with the recurrence relation, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Identified that the expression is a nested set with nine layers.\n2. Started computing each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n3. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n4. Confirmed each computation step by step, ensuring no arithmetic errors.\n5. Recognized the recurrence pattern and derived a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation.\n6. Verified the closed-form solution with known values from the layers.\n7. Applied the formula to find Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n8. Double-checked the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one. It's a bit tedious, but it works. Another way to think about it is that each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, but since the number of layers is small, it's quicker to compute each one. However, for practice, maybe I can try to find a general formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. It's interesting to see how the recurrence relation can be used to find a closed-form solution, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Either way, the answer is 88572.

Add the carryover 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Add the carryover 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carryover 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0*b^{n}, but actually, since L_1 = 4, let's find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is indeed following L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the pattern in the layers.\n\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations.\n\n4. Compute the final result by multiplying Layer 9 by 3.\n\n5. Verify the computations using alternative methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute Layer 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compute Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Compute Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Compute Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. But in this case, since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation seems appropriate.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer.\n\n4. Multiply the 9th layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7.

Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in calculation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let's try to find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry over 1, write 5. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carry over 2, write 7. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carry over 2, write 7. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought it was a nested expression with nine layers, but when I count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, it's actually nine times, meaning there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 88572 should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed before. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be sure. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be solved using a closed-form formula. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 11. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, let's write it as 29524. So, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo putting it together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 total so far 87000\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 total 88500\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 total 88560\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 total 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems to follow correctly. I multiplied each layer by 3 and added 1, then used that result in the next layer. Then, after computing Layer 9, I multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. I think that's correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.

Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, this is getting too long. Maybe I should just compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let me count the digits again:\n\n29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nBut let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). But let me see if that's the case. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution into this:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract B from both sides:\n\n0 = 1 + 2B \u21d2 2B = -1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nNow, plug B back into the initial condition equation:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2) \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.
