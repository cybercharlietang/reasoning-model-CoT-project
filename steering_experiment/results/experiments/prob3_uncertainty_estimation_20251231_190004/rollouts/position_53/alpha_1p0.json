    "text": " The next digit is 9: 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2. The next digit is 2: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so the carry over 2 is written down. So putting it all together: 2 8 9 7 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me write it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\nNow, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, after 9, we have 5, then 2, then 4. So, when we get to the 9, we have 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. Then, moving to the next digit, which is 5: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1. Then, the next digit is 2: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0. Then, the next digit is 9: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2. Finally, the next digit is 2: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, no carry. So putting it together, starting from the right, we have 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 7, then 9, then 8. Wait, that would be 8757572? Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the place values. Let me write it out more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover: 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, carryover: 0\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover: 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 thousands place: 7, carryover: 0\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 7, carryover: 2\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 hundred-thousands place: 8, carryover: 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8.\n\nWait, but that would be 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, isn't it? Wait, no, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it directly. 29524 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, 2\u00d73=6+1=7, 5\u00d73=15, 2\u00d73=6+1=7, 9\u00d73=27, 2\u00d73=6+2=8. So writing it out: 8 (from 2\u00d73 + carryover 2), then 7 (from 9\u00d73), then 7 (from 5\u00d73 + carryover 1), then 5 (from 2\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73 + carryover 1), then 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I should compute it as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext, 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext, 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, from right to left, we have 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8. So the number is 8757572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me do it another way.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (from 2\u00d73 + 2), 7 (from 9\u00d73), 7 (from 5\u00d73 + 1), 5 (from 2\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73 + 1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that seems to be 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572. But that can't be correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the number of digits. Let me compute it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n    29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572. But wait, 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572, right? Because 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me check:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So I must have made a mistake in the previous calculation. So, the correct result is 88572, not 877572. Where did I go wrong? Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (from 2\u00d73 + 2), 7 (from 9\u00d73), 7 (from 5\u00d73 +1), 5 (from 2\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that's 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572, but that's not correct because when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, I must have miscounted the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number. 88572 is a 5-digit number, but according to the multiplication steps, I ended up with 6 digits. That suggests I made an error in the multiplication.\n\nWait, let me try again, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nLet me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    \u00d7       3\n    -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (from 2\u00d73 + 2), 8 (from 9\u00d73 +1), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). So, writing it from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572, which is correct. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including an extra digit. So, the correct multiplication is 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter computing Layer 9 as 29524, then 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to compute it step by step, I got confused and thought it was 877572, which was wrong. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3\u00d713 =1 +39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3\u00d740=1 +120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1 +363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I got confused and thought it was 877572, but now I see it's actually 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm once more by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I thought the final step was 3 \u00d7 29524, which is 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check all the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of them.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carry over of 0, so we're done.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding them step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute L_5 again: L_4 is 121. So, L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to explore another approach, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, let's solve for A and B.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nNow, plug A back into the first equation:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThis method confirms the previous result. So, using the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrived at the same answer. That gives me even more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression with ratio 3, the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which we used above.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm certain that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)= (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L(4)= (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I can confidently say the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the innermost layers efficiently. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me double-check each layer computation because it's easy to make an error with so many layers. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, it's a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=40\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4=(243 -1)/2=121\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5=(729 -1)/2=364\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6=(2187 -1)/2=1093\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7=(6561 -1)/2=3280\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8=(19683 -1)/2=9841\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=29524\n\nYes, all these match the previous computations. So, it's clear that using the formula is more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer manually, especially when dealing with multiple layers. Therefore, the final answer is 3 multiplied by a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just verify once again to be sure. If I substitute n=9 into the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10}=59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

But just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers manually again to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + (3 * 4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + (3 * 13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + (3 * 40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + (3 * 121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + (3 * 364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + (3 * 1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + (3 * 3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + (3 * 9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer checks out. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524, which we've confirmed is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer step by step. After computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost layer is 29524.

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that again: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer again step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can represent this expression recursively. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, let's compute f(n) for n from 1 to 9. f(1) = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Then, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see, since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that f(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but in our case, since each f(n) is finite, we can proceed. Let's compute f(0) hypothetically. If n=0, f(0) would be 1 + 3*f(-1), but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, f(9) = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, after verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 *3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +60=88,560. 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me double-check each layer because the numbers are growing rapidly, and it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the calculations seem correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (nine layers), computing each step is manageable. However, just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, without using the formula, just computing each layer step by step is also feasible, as I did earlier. Either way, the answer is the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer and moving outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step manually might be the safest approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Lh = 3*L_{h,n-1}, which has the solution Lh = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively a term in a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can be modeled as a geometric series with a ratio of 3.\n\nIn general, for such expressions, the value after n layers can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so (3^{10} -1)/2 as above.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I end up with the same final answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem. Each method leads me to the same conclusion, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. So, I'm pretty sure that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+\"s. The innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous). So, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, my computation from Layer1 to Layer9 seems correct, with Layer9 being the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me compute 29524*3 again to make sure. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. But wait, let me check using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I did the initial layers, I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. But let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. Since the expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), I think I counted correctly up to Layer 9. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1+3(1+3)). Let's do that step by step.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1+3=4. Then, next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Then, outermost: 3*13=39.\n\nAlternatively, using my layer method:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\nFinal result: 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Then next layer: 1+3*4=13. Then next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then outermost: 3*40=120.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nFinal: 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, so it should be correct for the larger one as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, yes, that seems to be the right answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recurrence. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * something. Wait, let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer, leading to the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry 1, write 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry 1, write 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry 2, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, digit 2. 2*3=6+1=7, digit 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, digit 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carry 2, digit 8. 2*3=6+2=8, digit 8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers because when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. But let me double-check the layers because that seems like a big number. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, that's the final answer. Wait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula instead of computing each layer. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p =1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a bit different. But the recurrence approach worked well. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

So multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall the formula for solving a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. The solution is a_n = (c*r^{n} - c)/(r - 1). Wait, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r). Wait, in our case, c is 1, and r is 3. So let's plug in c=1, r=3. Then the particular solution is K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So the answer should be 88572. I think I've got it right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers instead of nine. Let's compute it step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = 81 -1=80/2=40, but wait, no, because in this smaller problem, we have three layers inside the 3*. Wait, actually, in the original problem, the number of layers is nine, but in this smaller problem, it's three layers. Let's see:\n\nWait, the formula gives a_n as the value after n layers, but in the original problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. But in the smaller problem, with three layers inside, it's 3*a_3, which would be 3*40 = 120. But when I computed manually, I got 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), where the innermost part is 1+3. So each layer adds one more 3*(...). Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3( Layer 1 )\nLayer 3: 1 + 3( Layer 2 )\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3( Layer 8 )\nThen the entire expression is 3*( Layer 9 )\n\nSo, in the smaller problem, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), that's three layers inside, so a_3 = 40, but when I computed manually, I got 39. Wait, that's inconsistent. Let me compute it again.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))):\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I got 39, but that must have been a mistake. Let me compute it step by step:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4\nThen 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nThen 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nThen 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula works because a_3 = 40, and 3*a_3 = 120.\n\nEarlier, when I thought I got 39, I must have misapplied the layers. So, in the original problem, the number of layers is nine, so a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nNow add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I messed up the positions. Let me try that again, carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. That matches the earlier result. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 29524: the digits are 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, 4*3=12, 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. But when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time you go out, you add another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524=88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. So, if I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, that would be helpful. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using methods for linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: Layer 2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: Layer 3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: Layer 4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)=59048, then 59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, then used a formula approach to confirm. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General Solution**: The closed-form solution for the recurrence is \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9**: \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, right?

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me just verify the computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem as a geometric series or find a pattern that could allow me to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is computed correctly, so the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Using the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which expands to a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nIf I expand this, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so maybe the expansion is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nIf I expand a_3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3*3*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9*4, which is 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nExpanding a_4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*13) = 1 + 3*(1 + 39) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nIf I expand it all the way, a_4 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2*4 + 3^3*12 + ... Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we found earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent every time I go through it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a function. Let me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) for n >= 2, with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is f(1) = 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(f(n-1)) +1.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the outermost layer is 3*(f(9)), since the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, no, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 3*f(9), where f(9) is 1 + 3*f(8), etc.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, f(9) = 29524, so 3*f(9) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThen, solving this recurrence relation, as I did earlier, gives f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute f(5) using both methods to check.\n\nUsing the step-by-step method:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nUsing the formula: f(5) = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, f(6) = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the formula works, so f(9) = 29524, and 3*f(9) = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, after going through each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and checking intermediate steps, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, perhaps I should do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing a few layers again. Let's check Layer 5:\n\nLayer 4: 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 364, so 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me try to model this. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up to a geometric progression, so using the closed-form formula saves time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nBut either way, the answer seems to be 88572.\n\nWait, just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's take Layer 8 again: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's do it digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Hmm, but let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, and each closing parenthesis at the end. So starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer1. Then each subsequent 1+3 wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1. Then moving out, each 1+3( is another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3( before the first closing parenthesis. Hmm, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Each 1+3( adds a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)) So the innermost is Layer1: 1+3. Then Layer2: 1+3(Layer1). Then Layer3: 1+3(Layer2), and so on. So how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, maybe it's easier to see that each time we have a 1+3(, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*(...))  \nLayer8: 1 + 3*(...Layer9...)  \nLayer7: 1 + 3*(...Layer8...)  \n...  \nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1+3(...), so starting from Layer1 as 1+3, then Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, which is the innermost. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So the outermost is Layer9, and the innermost is Layer1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3, that's Layer1. Then, moving out, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(Layer1), that's Layer2. Then, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer2) = Layer3, and so on, until Layer9, which is the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, I think I did it right earlier, computing up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because 3*(Layer9) is 3*29524=88572, which seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient and less error-prone, especially for a larger number of layers. But since the problem only had nine layers, even computing each step manually wasn't too bad, though it required careful attention to avoid arithmetic mistakes.\n\nSo, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I was able to compute the result efficiently. This approach avoids the tedium of calculating each layer individually and reduces the chance of errors.\n\nI also double-checked my work by computing each layer step by step, which helped confirm that the formula was correct and that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's always good to verify results using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with complex expressions.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested pattern and express each layer as a recurrence relation.\n2. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula.\n3.

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recursive formula: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That was a good exercise. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279.

Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So total 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation method, we derive a formula for each layer, confirming the result.

    "text": " Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 9 * 3, I got 27, added the carryover 1, making it 28. So, the thousands place becomes 8, and we carry over 2 to the ten thousands place. Then, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but when I did the earlier step-by-step layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that seems right. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But wait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I did the layers, each time I added 1 + 3*(previous layer), and I ended up with 29524 for Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. But let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I miscounted the layers. Let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the initial 3. So, yes, I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might make computing higher layers easier without having to compute each step manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is given by:\n\na_n = (c / (r - 1)) * (r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - (c / (r - 1))) * r^{n-1}\n\nWait, let me make sure. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c * (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence starts from n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices. Let me set n starting from 0.\n\nLet me redefine the problem:\n\nLet\u2019s let a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n\nAnd so on, up to a_8, which would be Layer 9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nThen, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = (1/(3 - 1)) * (3^{n+1} - 1) + (a_0 - (1/(3 - 1))) * 3^{n}\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (1/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) + (4 - 1/2)*3^{n}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = (1/2)*3^{n+1} - 1/2 + (7/2)*3^{n}\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (1/2)*3^{n+1} + (7/2)*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nFactor out 3^n:\n\n= 3^n * [ (3/2) + 7/2 ] - 1/2\n\n= 3^n * (10/2) - 1/2\n\n= 5*3^n - 1/2\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the steps again.\n\nThe standard solution for a recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c * (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nIn our case, r = 3, c = 1, and a_0 = 4.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\na_n = 3^{n} * 4 + 1 * (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2\n\n= (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=0: a_0 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (9*27 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(9*81 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(9*243 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(9*729 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(9*2187 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula a_n = (9*3^{n} -1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is n=8, a_8=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_0 to a_8, the outermost layer is a_8, so the expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, we can compute a_8 directly without computing each layer:\n\na_8 = (9*3^8 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, 9*6561=59049.\n\nThen, 59049 -1=59048.\n\nDivide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. The entire expression is 3*a_8, which is 3*(9*3^8 -1)/2 = (27*3^8 -3)/2.\n\nBut 3*9*3^8 = 27*3^8 = 3^3 *3^8=3^(11)=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_8 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_8 = (3^11 -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which builds up the series.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is the same: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result, after computing all layers and multiplying by 3, is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems like I'm adding digits beyond the original number. Let me check: 29524 is a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply by 3, I should have a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n- 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572? Wait, let me check with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Maybe it can be represented recursively. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n(1+3(...)) \u2192 Layer 2\n... up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So yes, nine layers.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I write them in order, it's 87727572. But that can't be correct because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Wait, I think I messed up the alignment. Let me try again, more carefully:\n\nLet me write 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4? Wait, no, 29524 is actually 29,524, which is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 29,524, which is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88,572. So the total would be 88,572. Let me check with another method: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recast the problem: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So that's 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the total is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me see how many layers there are. Counting the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections, I think there are nine layers. So n=9. So using the formula above, E=3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. I'll recompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. Then 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, just computing each layer step by step, I still get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me double-check the layers because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524 is correct for Layer 9, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...\n\nCounting the number of layers: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are 9 sets of parentheses in total.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct. So, 29524 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but actually, the standard formula for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*( (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) ). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nYes, the solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b * (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nBut in our case, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps L_0 would be 1, since L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, where L_0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, and L_1 = 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => 3*L_0 = 3 => L_0 = 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, L_0 = 1.\n\nThen, using the formula:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b * (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nHere, a = 3, b = 1, L_0 = 1.\n\nSo, L_n = 3^{n} * 1 + 1 * (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nL_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nTo combine terms, let's get a common denominator:\n\n= (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2\n\n= (3*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, and that something is the same structure. So, if I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and x is the next layer. But since the structure repeats, perhaps there's a way to express it as a sum.\n\nWait, but since it's finite with 9 layers, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value using the formula I derived: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nIn this case, n = 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I can be pretty sure that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each step. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)) with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*a_9, where a_9 is as computed. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in computing 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Correct.\n\nAnother way to compute 3*29524: 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me check: 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed sequentially. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1 + 3 occur? Let me count: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 3(...) until the outermost. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, my earlier computation was correct, with 9 layers leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, perhaps it's better to compute each layer as I did. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the solution to this recurrence can be found. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, which is 4. Then Layer 2: n=2, which is 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the recurrence relation.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back and recompute each layer step by step to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, we have:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3*B\n\nSo, we have:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSubtract 3*B from both sides:\nB - 3*B = 1\n-2*B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is correct. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. So, my calculation is correct because I computed up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using a recurrence relation approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Using this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but I just realized that when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, maybe? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach confirms the result.

So, the outermost operation is 3 times (Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count: 1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers? Wait, actually, when I wrote it out, I think there are nine layers. Let me count the number of '1+3's. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each '1+3' is a layer. Let me count the number of '1+3's:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Next is (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on, until we have nine '1+3's. Wait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that each time a new parenthesis starts, which would correspond to a new layer. Let me try to count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)) is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until the ninth layer. So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, my earlier computation of nine layers is correct, ending with Layer 9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the layers, I thought maybe it's a geometric series or something, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recurrence. Maybe there's a formula for that. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, in our case, we have 9 layers, right? So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that confirms that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula also confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should verify each step again. Let's go through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct).\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct).\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct).\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct).\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct).\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3s or the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first 3. It's 3(1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought before. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my computation seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series? Wait, let me see. If I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 * 3 = 6 (ten thousands place). 9 * 3 = 27 (thousands place), so write down 7 and carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 (hundreds place), write down 7 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 (tens place). 4 * 3 = 12 (units place), write down 2 and carry over 1. But wait, there are no more digits, so we add the final carry over. So, putting it all together: 6 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), with a carry over 1 at the end, making it 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1. It seems like a geometric progression or something similar. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, just to verify my result.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the layers go from 1 to 9, so for layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got for Layer 9 earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nI see, each layer adds another term of 3^k. So, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, it's a bit different because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which expands to 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let me check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 is sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 is sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which would be sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nBut wait, the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThis further confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did earlier, which also led me to the same result.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying through multiple methods, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I got Layer 9 as 29,524, and then 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think I confused myself earlier because I misaligned the digits when writing down the multiplication. So, to recap, each layer is computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense now. Each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric series kind of problem, but since it's nested, we have to compute each layer step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. If we have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), it's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find C and D. For n = 1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D.\n\nWe also need another equation to solve for C and D. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: a_2 = C*3^2 + D = 9C + D = 13.\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\n3C + D = 4\n\n9C + D = 13\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: 6C = 9 \u2192 C = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nNow, substitute C back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 \u2192 9/2 + D = 4 \u2192 D = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's correct. To make sure, I'll try computing a few layers using the formula to see if they match my earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and the step-by-step computation is validated. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.
