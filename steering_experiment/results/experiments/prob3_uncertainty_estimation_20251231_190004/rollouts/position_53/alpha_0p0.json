Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let's add these: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, carry over 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each computation again to make sure I didn't add incorrectly. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, Layer 3. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation led me to the same answer. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 1500+72=1572. Adding to 87000: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.

Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So, I think I did each step correctly.

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding them step by step seems manageable. However, just for thoroughness, let me consider if there's a formula that could be applied here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c). Let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n = k. Plugging into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*(3)^{n} + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4. So 4 = A*3 + (-1/2) => A*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive relation. Let me define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did before. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let's consider the expression: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, the recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3*B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3*B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the recurrence relation, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step or using the closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I think I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let me compute 3\u00d7364: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. Compute 3\u00d71093: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9 \u2192 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. Compute 3\u00d73280: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840 \u2192 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Compute 3\u00d79841: Let's break it down. 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's test that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left-hand side: A*3^n + B. Right-hand side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value. But in our case, all the a_n are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence without assuming a particular form. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, the first layer is 4. The second is 1 + 3*4 = 13. The third is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, 40 is 1 + 3*13, which is 1 + 39. Similarly, 13 is 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12. So, each time, it's like adding 1 and tripling the previous amount. This seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term as I did before. Alternatively, I could write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, with nine 1s and nine 3s inside. Wait, but actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the total number of terms is 9. But regardless, using the formula I derived earlier, which gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1s. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, using the formula, the innermost term is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, after 9 layers, it's 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, let me think about that. Each time you expand a layer, you get 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand all the layers, I might end up with a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting with the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine 1s. Let me denote S as the sum inside. So, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine 1s. Then, S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the sum with eight 1s. But this seems like it's leading back to the same recurrence relation. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression:\n\nS = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1s.\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nS = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, but that's the same as the original expression without the outermost 3. So, the original problem is 3*S, where S is the sum with nine layers. From earlier, we found that S = 29524, so 3*S = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each time I add a layer, I'm effectively adding another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nFrom the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. Then, each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1.\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. So, Layer n: 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n.\n\nSo, sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich matches our earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2*K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute the value without having to go through each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially if there are more layers. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which is what I did before. So, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved time, but since I was working it out step by step, the manual calculation helped me verify the pattern. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. The rest are zeros, so 8 followed by 8, 5, 7, 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So when I multiply by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524=88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's recompute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it directly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K -3*K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, let's set a_n = B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before! So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which effectively is building a sum where each term is 3^{n} times the initial 1. But since it's nested, the total sum ends up being (3^{n} - 1)/2, as we saw earlier. So, for n=9 layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, repeated nine times. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 0 = 0. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me try computing the expression step by step, without layers, just expanding each parenthesis one by one. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(...) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if there are more layers in the future. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9).\n\nCompute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that the value is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem has 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the recursive formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the recursive formula and solving the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in the computations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. This expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let me check: When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, and going out, there are 9 layers in total.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Wait, but let me check: The innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer increments n by 1. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a good check. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recursive formula, or applying the geometric series sum formula\u2014the result is the same: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods all converge to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572, which was incorrect. That was a mistake in the digit positions. I must have miscounted the digits. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carry.\nNext, 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext, 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carry.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to see if I made any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3 times the entire inner expression. Let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n10. 3(1+3)))))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Wait, no, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1). So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer9 would be the outermost, which is 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute each layer again to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with 9 layers.\n\nIf I denote S as the innermost sum, then each layer adds another 3*S. But since we're dealing with a finite number of layers, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step as I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you go out a layer, you're effectively adding another power of 3 multiplied by 1, but adjusted for the nesting.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's not a straightforward geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nBut as I found earlier, the closed-form solution for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked this enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinal multiplication:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88572.

Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 So each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I know that for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe it's better to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 a_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40 a_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121 a_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364 a_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093 a_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280 a_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841 a_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. To find a closed-form, let's consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then the entire original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula supports the step-by-step computation. So I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to the 9th layer, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carry 2, write 7. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was 1 + 3*Layer 8, which was 1 + 3*9841. Let me verify that 3*9841 is indeed 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Yes, that's correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we have a recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3=177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So yes, 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recursion here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nThen, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on, as we computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, Layer9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that n=9 in the formula corresponds to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one. Yes, because a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost, so yes, the formula applies.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3= (30000 - 476)*3=90000 - 1428=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I feel like this number is a bit large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, using this formula, we can compute each layer directly without having to compute each previous layer. That might save time, especially if there are many layers. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula confirms our step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I could recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me explore that approach.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this expression step by step, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a general formula for a_n, perhaps we can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nWait, another thought: since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways to be confident that it's correct. Just to recap:\n\n1. Computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, getting 29524 for the outermost layer.\n\n2. Multiplied that by 3 to get 88572.\n\n3. Derived a general formula for each layer using recurrence relations, confirmed that it gives the same result.\n\n4. Expressed the entire expression as a geometric series and computed it directly, also arriving at 88572.\n\nAll methods lead to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the outermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check Layer 7 again.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280 is 9,840. 1 + 9,840 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841 is 29,523. 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 7, I think I might have confused 3*1,093 as 3,279, which is correct. So, everything seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n= 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation of Layer 9.\n\nLet me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is a recursive sequence, perhaps? Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. Now, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or derive a formula.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let's see if these numbers correspond to any known sequence or if there's a pattern in their growth.\n\nLooking at L_n:\n\nEach term is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\n(3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\n(81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\n(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\n(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\n(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\n(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\n(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\n(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Just to make sure, I can try computing a few layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor example, let's compute L_4 using the formula:\n\nL_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula seems solid.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, after 9 layers, it's 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, which further confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles now: computing each layer step by step, using a recurrence relation with a closed-form solution, and then applying it directly. All methods led me to the same final answer of 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
