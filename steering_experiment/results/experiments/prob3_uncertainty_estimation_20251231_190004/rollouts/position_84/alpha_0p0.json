    "text": " Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think: Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. I wonder if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's consider the general form: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 +1. Then, 1 + 3*(3 +1) =1 + 9 +3 =13. Then, 1 + 3*(13) =1 + 39=40=3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. 27+9+3+1=40. Yes, so each layer seems to sum up to the next power of 3. Wait, let me see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4=3^1 +1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(3 +1)=1 + 9 +3=13=3^2 + 3^1 +1. Layer 3:1 +3*(13)=1 + 39=40=3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 +1. So, in general, Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=27+9+3+1=40, which is Layer 3. Similarly, Layer 4 would be 1 +3*40=1 +120=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121. So, yes, each Layer n is the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +...+3^{n}. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, m=9, sum= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572. I think I've confirmed this multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues until the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers (from layer 1 to layer 9), the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let's see. Each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^(p) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => Subtract L_p from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => 2*L_p = -1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, maybe we can express this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to model this. Let me consider the innermost term as 1 + 3. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, as I saw earlier, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc., up to L_9 = 29524. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can express this as a sum. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote each nested part as follows: Let\u2019s define E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form expression. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I had used the formula directly, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have nine layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 which I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, especially since it's only nine layers. But having the closed-form formula is nice because it can save time if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...\" sections. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears, excluding the outermost 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Then Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). Continuing until Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, that's 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3. So, that's correct. So, the computation seems accurate. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear equation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which is exactly what I got when I computed each layer manually. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine 3s. Let me see: If I expand it, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next step). So, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3)) and so on. But perhaps using the formula for a geometric series would be more efficient. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which we've already solved.

So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, we could have directly computed a_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step method.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me think if there's a recursive formula here. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to see the pattern. Let's list out the a_n values:\n\nn | a_n\n---|---\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\nA*3^n + B = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n=> -2B = 1\n=> B = -1/2\n\nNow, plug B back into the initial condition equation:\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n=> 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n=> A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.

Each layer adds a power of 3, so perhaps the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 threes.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C * 3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} Substitute the general solution into the recurrence: C * 3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C * 3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Now, set the left and right sides equal: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with a calculator to be sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). This results in \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n2. **Compute innermost layer**: Start with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n3. **Iterate outward**: Compute each subsequent layer using \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\):\n   - \\( L_2 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 29524 \\)\n4. **Multiply by outermost 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3... terms. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time you have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: From the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each time you have another 1 + 3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1). Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times 1 + 3 appears: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, the inner expression is another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) - outermost\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nI think there are 9 layers here because each time you have 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, layers 1 through 9. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me verify this with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let's see if there's a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, L(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=9 corresponds correctly. Since the innermost layer is n=1, and each layer outwards increases n by 1. So, the outermost layer is n=9, which is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be seen as a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, the closed-form formula we derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with each layer defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\n2. Find the closed-form formula for L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\n3. Compute L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute L(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nL(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4.\n\nL(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =13.\n\nL(3)=(81 -1)/2=40.\n\nL(4)=(243 -1)/2=121.\n\nL(5)=(729 -1)/2=364.\n\nL(6)=(2187 -1)/2=1093.\n\nL(7)=(6561 -1)/2=3280.\n\nL(8)=(19683 -1)/2=9841.\n\nL(9)=(59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nAll correct.\n\nMultiply L(9) by 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost layer. Using a closed-form formula for the nth layer, we find that the innermost layer (layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula \\(L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Computing up to layer 9 gives us 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series from the start. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which leads to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, expanding all the layers would give a sum that's a geometric series. Let me try that approach as a check. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let's expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote the innermost as S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. S_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. S_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. S_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. S_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. S_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. S_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The expression can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The innermost term is 1, then each layer adds 3 times the previous. So, the total expression without the outermost 3 would be S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, the number of terms is nine, but let's think about it. Each time we expand a layer, we're adding another term multiplied by 3. So, if we have n layers, the sum S_n would be S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is the same recurrence as before. So, solving it as a geometric series, we get S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, all methods lead to the same answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost, compute each layer step by step, which gives 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, recognizing it as a geometric series with ratio 3 and solving using the formula also gives the same result. So, I think I've covered all bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and multiple methods confirm the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": " Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but nested. Let me recall that for such expressions, each layer can be represented recursively. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula without computing each layer, saving time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable. Either way, the answer seems to be 88572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using both methods and see if they match. Let's say, for example, with two layers: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Using the formula: L_1 = 4, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Then, 3*L_2=39. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases too. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which isn't a constant ratio. Wait, maybe it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each layer follows a geometric progression or something. Let's see the values we got:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. That seems to fit. For example, Layer 2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes. Layer 3 = 3*13 +1 = 40, correct. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it. But since we only have 9 layers, maybe computing each step is faster. Alternatively, if I can model this as a geometric series, perhaps I can find a pattern. Let me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B +1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B +1. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I'm only dealing with 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see: The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L9 = (3^10)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which can be seen as a geometric progression. Each time, we're adding 1 and then scaling by 3. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). It's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers, we can compute it step by step or use the formula we derived. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we reach the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\).

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2). Continuing until Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's correct, 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, 9 layers, each computed as above. So, the calculation seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3 + B. When n=0, L_0 would be 1, since it's the base case before any layers. Wait, maybe n starts at 1, so perhaps we can set up the equation as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10: Let's compute it step by step. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to test the approach. Let's say the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Then, 3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula: The innermost is L_1=4, then L_2=13, L_3=40. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_3=3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula: The number of layers here is 3, so L_3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct. So, the approach works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition: Let's say n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute it step by step once more, perhaps using a different approach.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Now, I notice that each L_n is 3 times the previous L plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step or using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I found that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(next layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without expanding each layer, I could use this formula directly. Since there are 9 layers (from a_1 to a_9), so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So it's a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more by computing each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.

This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad either. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 Each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 4, then a2 = 3*a1 +1, a3 = 3*a2 +1, etc., up to a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general formula for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A +1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with a1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. a2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive formula, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find the value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... (1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9, with L_1 being the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on up to L_9. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for L_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, computing each layer step by step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and then confirm it using a general formula.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, the recursion here is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Wait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula for such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence like Ln = a*Ln-1 + b is Ln = a^(n) * C + b/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, so a = 3, and b = 1. So, the solution would be Ln = 3^(n) * C + 1/(1 - 3) = 3^(n)*C - 1/2. Let me check that. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L. So, substituting into the recurrence: L = 1 + 3*L. Solving for L: L - 3L = 1 => -2L = 1 => L = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9, which is the 9th layer, would be L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10 or something, but since I already have the answer, perhaps that's sufficient. Let me just double-check my multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake there. 29524 *3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 *3 =6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3 = 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12=60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572.

For example, suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Which matches. So my method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and still arrived at the correct answer. So, whether by recognizing the pattern and finding a formula or by brute-force computation, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using either step-by-step computation or recognizing the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841, correct. Then Layer 9: 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524, correct. Then 29524 *3: as above, 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since Layer 1 is 4). Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Start from the innermost layer and compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we confirm Layer 9 is 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
