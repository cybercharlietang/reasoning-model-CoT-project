Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if that's a pattern. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 ... up to a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} Substitute a_{n-1} = C*3^{n-1} + D into the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, set this equal to the general solution a_n = C*3^n + D: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, use the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Good. So, using this formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which is exactly what I got when I computed each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, after n layers, the term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I think I can safely conclude that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression.

Let me check one more time, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I did before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug back A into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses starting from the innermost. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... )))). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Since the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is the outermost layer. Therefore, using the formula, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match. For example, layer 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or have a recursive formula. Let me think. Suppose we have a term defined recursively as x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, starting with x_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is x_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution x_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, what is x_1? From the innermost layer, x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, x_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier calculations. For n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: x_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate the left and right sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think about expanding the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's denote the entire expression as E. But wait, E is equal to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), but the inner part is similar to E itself, except it's one layer less. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as I did before, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Since I already have a closed-form solution, maybe I can use that to compute the final answer without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write out the entire expansion. Let me denote the expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So, expanding this, we can see that each time we add a layer, we're adding another term that's 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Wait, let me think. If I have 9 layers, then the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 3*(previous). So, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, but I'm not sure. Let me check: If I have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3, then perhaps the total sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2, but that was for the a_n term, which is the inner part before multiplying by the outer 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up each part multiplied by 3: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it iteratively since there are only 9 layers. Alternatively, I can recognize that each step is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, we can write a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 1 + 3*1, where a_0 would be 1? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If I have a recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the general formula for a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let me test for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But in our case, a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} + 1)/2. Let's check: For n=1: (3 +1)/2 = 2, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my initial condition is different. Wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, if I consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. So, perhaps the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test for n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. For example, a_4 should be 121. Using the formula, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. So, the formula works, and therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough.

The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the formula works. Therefore, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we can compute it as: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

Wait, let me see: n1 = 4 n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 n4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 n5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 n6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 n7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 n8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 n9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is generated by n_k = 1 + 3*n_{k-1}, starting from n1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for n_k. The recurrence is n_k = 3*n_{k-1} + 1, with n1=4. The homogeneous solution is n_h = C*3^{k}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution n_p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is n_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition n1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, n_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: n1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: n2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, n9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, n9=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*n9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since each layer is n_k=(3^{k+1}-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*n9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9, which is the outermost layer, is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the step-by-step computation.

That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n-1} * a_1 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = a_{n-1} * r + c, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1} - c/(r - 1). Wait, maybe I should rederive it. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's compute layer 4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is exactly what I got before. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is correct. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4. 3. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous layer). 4. After computing up to layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 5. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and solve it using the formula for linear recurrences to find that layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. 6. Multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This kind of nested multiplication looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, the recursion can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the final answer using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's consistent.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this recurrence can be solved using a formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So starting with n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a geometric progression, but let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Suppose I have a function f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. Then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from f(n) - 3f(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, it's f(n) = 3f(n-1) + 1. So the homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3f(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the final answer. Just to recap, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result as computing each layer step by step. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because the innermost layer is 1 + 3, but if I think of it as a recurrence relation, maybe I can model it as such. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L(9). Then, the total expression is 3*L(9). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check this by looking for a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series. Maybe I can express it that way. Let me think. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula. Let me try that. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern immediately, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did before, which also led me to the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 3 multiplied by the next term, so perhaps the total is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But since it's nested nine times, maybe it's equivalent to a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another multiplication, so perhaps the total is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which would be similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and so on, nine times. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, since I have the closed-form expression, I can use that to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. But since I already did the step-by-step computation and verified it with the closed-form, I'm confident that the result is correct.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I have a term like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is a layer. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, n = 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049, 3^11 = 177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute the layers again using the formula. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is Layer 2. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, Layer 3. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, Layer 4. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, Layer 5. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, Layer 6. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, Layer 7. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, Layer 8. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, Layer 9. Then, 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric sequence or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's define L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. For n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(L_9). But since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's a more efficient way if I recognize the pattern. But since I was able to compute it step by step, that also works.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or check for any possible miscalculations. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again to confirm. Let's do that.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, I can see that each term is following a pattern where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. Using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer again.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1), then each a_n is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without manually calculating each layer. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine, both methods work.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then layer 2 is a_2 = 13, layer 3 is 40, and so on up to layer 9, which is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms my previous calculation. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9, so the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check that. 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. But 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression inside the outermost 3 is a_9, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, in terms of the geometric series, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the sum after 9 layers. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series with ratio 3, but since each term is nested, it's a bit more involved. But since I already have the formula, maybe that's the easiest way. So, to recap, the problem was to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. By recognizing the recursive pattern, I found that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the manual computations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (next layer). By recognizing this as a recursive sequence, we can derive a formula for each layer. The nth layer can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the given problem with 9 layers, the innermost value is computed step by step, leading to the outermost layer. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Wait, but the expression is finite, with 9 layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth layer. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, L1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=0, we can assume L0=1 (since L1 = 1 + 3*L0, so 4 = 1 + 3*L0 => L0=1). So, for n=0, L0=1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense.

That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps this can be modeled as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check the multiplication just to be safe. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this problem in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could generalize this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check using a different approach. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each layer step by step, then I derived a closed-form formula to verify my result. Both approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to see if there's a quicker way. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a geometric series kind of situation, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, so L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 40, etc. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer step by step.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's compute a4 using the formula: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized without computing each layer, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check with a different approach. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the correct breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, both methods give me the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, yes, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. That seems consistent. So, if I can find a general formula for L_n, maybe it's a geometric series or something. Let's see. The recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => Subtract 3*L_p from both sides: -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a linear function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model L_n as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could express the entire computation using the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Since 3^{11} is 177147, then (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. That's probably a more efficient method if you recognize the pattern early on. But since I was initially computing each layer step by step, it worked out too. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula. Each layer follows a recurrence relation, leading to the final computation.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the recurrence relation, the nth layer can be expressed as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Computation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
