Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The formula I used earlier is indeed the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and an additional 1 is added each time. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplier and an addition. So, the closed-form solution we derived earlier is more appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation, and the closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which we used earlier. So, for n=9, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStart from the units digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.
