    "text": " Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more with a different approach. Let's compute the expression step by step, but using the closed-form formula. For each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 1: n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, using the formula, each layer is correct. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems solid. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have thought that each layer is just tripling and adding 1 each time, but the formula helps to generalize it.

Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the RHS is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " So, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Hmm, that's a fractional term, but our terms are integers. Maybe the particular solution is different, or perhaps I should consider homogeneous and particular solutions. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try solving the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as computed earlier. Now, to find a closed-form formula, let's consider the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. So, I think that's solid. Just to recap, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. After computing each layer up to the ninth, I get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are positive integers, so maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me try a particular solution as a constant, say a_n = C. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step, which is what I did initially. It's good that both methods lead to the same answer.

    "text": " The A*3^n terms cancel out on both sides, so we have: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. Layer 3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed the pattern in the layers and realized that each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, leading to rapid growth. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each one step by step is feasible. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my multiplication for 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using two different methods: computing each layer step by step and deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations.

So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the count of layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)) So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write the expression as: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Now, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer.

Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer, a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " Maybe subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as building up a number, and each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. To be thorough, let me check my calculations once more. Computing each layer: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, same result as before.

    "text": " Maybe subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value. But in our case, all the a_n are integers, so perhaps this suggests that the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution would give us the right form. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method is to solve the homogeneous equation and find a particular solution. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0 => r=3. So homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plug into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572.

    "text": " So, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because all our layers have positive integers. Maybe the homogeneous solution is sufficient? Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

    "text": " The A*3^n terms cancel out, leaving B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check the arithmetic one more time to be sure. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, where n starts at 1, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since a_9 =29524, then 3*a_9=88572.
