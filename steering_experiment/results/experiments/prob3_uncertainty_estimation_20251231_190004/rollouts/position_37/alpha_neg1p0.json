That matches, so I'm confident.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing it another way, maybe using a different approach to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula here.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to find a general formula for such a recursive expression.\n\nSuppose I define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which would be the value at Layer 9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a recursive sequence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the value I computed earlier.

Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. That seems correct. Hmm, but I feel like this might be a pattern that could be represented as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, maybe computing each step is the easiest way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to see if it's consistent. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is what I got earlier. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, computing each layer using the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because 29,524 * 3. Maybe I should compute it as 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, minus (476 * 3) because 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That matches my previous calculation. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula I can use here to compute it without expanding each layer step by step. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. If I let S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to n terms, then S can be expressed recursively as S = 1 + 3*S_prev, where S_prev is the previous term. But in this case, since each layer is added one by one, maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers. Let me compute each a_n step by step: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each term is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see. If I consider each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: For 3^{n}: A = A, which is always true. For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

Let me do that quickly: Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about the general formula for such nested expressions. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's a recursive expression where each term is a function of the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, gives us L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the outermost operation is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). Applying this formula up to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Use the recurrence relation**: \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n3. **Find the general formula**: \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n4. **Compute the 9th layer**: \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n5. **Multiply by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, reading it from the top: 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, which would be the innermost part. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, we can trust it. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, I think I did it right. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, for each layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince our original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, we could express the entire original expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think I've got this. The key was to recognize the pattern and then either compute each layer step by step or find a formula to compute the nth layer directly. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me do a quick recap:\n\n- The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))) \n- Each layer inside is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n- There are 9 layers, so the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9\n- Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n- Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524\n- Total expression =3*29524=88,572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly.

It was a bit of work, but breaking it down step by step and then finding a formula to verify made it manageable.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let's see: After the initial 3, there are 9 layers. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my earlier computation was correct, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+\" before each closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time we have \"1+3(\", which is the start of a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(\".\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\":\n\n2. 1+3(...\n\n3. 1+3(...\n\nAnd so on. Let me see how many \"1+3(\" are there. The expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, Layer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each time we have \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another \"1+3(\":\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(...\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3(...), there are eight \"1+3(\" inside. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3 (Layer 1)\n\n2. Then, moving out, 1+3( (Layer 2)\n\n3. Next, 1+3( (Layer 3)\n\n4. Then, 1+3( (Layer 4)\n\n5. Then, 1+3( (Layer 5)\n\n6. Then, 1+3( (Layer 6)\n\n7. Then, 1+3( (Layer 7)\n\n8. Then, 1+3( (Layer 8)\n\n9. Then, 1+3( (Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3(...), there are eight \"1+3(\" because the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), and inside that, there are eight more \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each time we have a new layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Since the expression has nine layers, as I initially thought, each layer from 1 to 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost. So, in my initial calculation, I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check by computing each layer again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the computed layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is roughly multiplying by 3 each time, but not exactly because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the growth is exponential, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. We can solve it to find a closed-form expression, but since n is only 9, it's easier to compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, the solution to the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be found using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 6 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 68,572? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 29524*3: Let me compute it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 6, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 68,572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Finally, the leading 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 6 (from the first 2*3), 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3 + carryover), 2 (from 4*3). So, the number is 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 2*3 is 6, then 9*3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, so that's 8 with a carryover of 2. Then 5*3=15 plus 1 is 16, so that's 6 with a carryover of 1. Then 2*3=6 plus 1 is 7. Then the leading 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 (from the first digit), then 7, then 6, then 8, then 2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the digits.

Wait, but earlier when I broke it down as 3*(29524), I thought 3*29524 is 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. But let me confirm with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach. 29524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.

It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nLooking at the pattern, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a linear recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me see if I can compute 3^10 another way to confirm. 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2: 243*243. Let's do this multiplication step by step:\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n243 * 3 = 729\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Thus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplying 29,524 by 3, let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 0 * 3 = 0 (since there are no more digits, but it's just 0).\nWait, actually, 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, let me write it as 29,524:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way, but it works.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI wonder if there's a quicker way to compute this without expanding each layer. Since I found a general formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and since n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me see:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 is 59,049 * 3 = 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's another way to look at it, using exponents. So, that's a neat formula. It's always good to see if a pattern can be generalized, especially for such repetitive nested expressions.\n\nBut since the problem only had nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually, even if it's a bit time-consuming. But knowing the general formula could save time if the number of layers increases.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer being 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n4. Verify the result using a different method or formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be generalized using recurrence relations or exponentials. It also emphasized the importance of careful arithmetic to avoid errors, especially with large numbers.\n\nI think I've got a solid understanding of how to approach similar problems now. It's all about breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts and looking for patterns that can simplify the computation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost nine layers, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check by another method. 29,524 * 3 can be calculated as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make an arithmetic error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on. Earlier, I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is correct, but when I continued, I had Layer 7 as 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Wait, 3*1093 is 3,279, right? Yes, because 1000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3,000+270+9=3,279. Then adding 1 gives 3,280. Correct. Layer 7: 3,280. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then add 1: 9,841. Correct. Layer 8: 9,841. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then add 1: 29,524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this using a different approach or check for a pattern. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, maybe this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for Ln. Let's see:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each layer is growing exponentially. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's try to model this recursion. Each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, matches L1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to 3^(9+1)=3^10. Let me compute 3^10 to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, so 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 once again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another multiplication method:\n\n29,524\n*         3\n----------\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, again, 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000 + 279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, final step: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, if I let L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see, let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLet me list out the layers again with their values:\n\nn: 1, L1=4\n\nn:2, L2=13\n\nn:3, L3=40\n\nn:4, L4=121\n\nn:5, L5=364\n\nn:6, L6=1093\n\nn:7, L7=3280\n\nn:8, L8=9841\n\nn:9, L9=29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation here. Let me see the differences between successive terms:\n\nFrom L1 to L2: 13 - 4 = 9\n\nFrom L2 to L3: 40 -13=27\n\nFrom L3 to L4:121 -40=81\n\nFrom L4 to L5:364 -121=243\n\nFrom L5 to L6:1093 -364=729\n\nFrom L6 to L7:3280 -1093=2187\n\nFrom L7 to L8:9841 -3280=6561\n\nFrom L8 to L9:29524 -9841=19683\n\nWait a minute, these differences are 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683. These look like powers of 3: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So the difference between Ln and L(n-1) is 3^n. Interesting. So, the recurrence relation is Ln = L(n-1) + 3^n. Hmm, but L1 is 4. Let me check if that holds.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = L1 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = L2 + 3^3 =13 +27=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=40 +81=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula seems to be Ln = L(n-1) + 3^n, with L1=4.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for Ln. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = L(n-1) + 3^n, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's write it as:\n\nLn - L(n-1) = 3^n.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the method of solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is Ln - L(n-1) = 0, which has the solution Ln = C, a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 3^n, we can try a particular solution of the form Pn = A*3^n.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nPn - P(n-1) = 3^n\n\nA*3^n - A*3^(n-1) = 3^n\n\nFactor out A*3^(n-1):\n\nA*3^(n-1)*(3 - 1) = 3^n\n\nA*3^(n-1)*2 = 3^n\n\nDivide both sides by 3^(n-1):\n\n2A = 3\n\nSo A = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = homogeneous + particular = C + (3/2)*3^n = C + (3^(n+1))/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C + (3^(1+1))/2 = C + 9/2.\n\nTherefore, C = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (-1/2) + (3^(n+1))/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since it's nested, it's a bit more involved. The key was to identify the pattern and then derive a formula for the nth layer, which allowed me to compute the value without manually calculating each step. That saved a lot of time, especially if the expression had more layers.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the derived formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the innermost layer and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n2. **Compute innermost layer**: Start with Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n3. **Proceed outward**: Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n4. **Recognize the pattern**: The layers follow a recurrence relation, leading to a closed-form formula: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n5. **Apply the formula**: For Layer 9, compute (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n6. **Final multiplication**: Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them: Starting from the first 3, then each (1+3( is a new layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me write it out: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each time you go out, you add another layer. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 1+3(layer1). Then layer3: 1+3(layer2). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3( is a new layer. So, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3( parts. Starting from the first 3, then each (1+3( is a new layer. So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), which is layer1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...), which is layer2, and so on. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3( 2. 1+3( 3. 1+3( 4. 1+3( 5. 1+3( 6. 1+3( 7. 1+3( 8. 1+3( 9. 1+3( 10. 1+3))))) So, wait, that seems like 9 layers of (1+3(...). Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), which is the innermost part. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine closing parentheses after the innermost 1+3. So, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, the innermost is layer1: (1+3). Then each layer out adds another. So, layer1: (1+3) layer2: 1+3(layer1) layer3: 1+3(layer2) ... up to layer9: 1+3(layer8). Then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, that makes sense. So, I computed up to layer9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me compute that again more carefully. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here because each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. I think that makes sense. Each time, I was just computing the next layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric series, but each term is built upon the previous one. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might make the calculation easier, especially if there are many layers. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. Let's try solving it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. To find C, we can set a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then Layer 2 is a_2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think this confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process for each of the nine layers, we arrive at the ninth layer's value, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is a layer. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is just 1+3, and then each time you go out, you add another layer. So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step using my method. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Wait, but if I compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. That's correct. So, using my method, I get 120, which is correct. So, that gives me more confidence that my method is correct for the larger problem.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, which might form a geometric progression. Let me explore that approach to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A\u00d73^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to write a general formula for the entire expression, which is 3\u00d7a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d7(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, that's another way to look at it. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked it, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe that's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. As I found earlier, this gives a geometric progression. So, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the total number of layers is 9, and the outermost term is 3*(a_9). Therefore, using the formula I derived, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I had before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => Subtract 3C from both sides: -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression before multiplying by the initial 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing each step by step is manageable, but having a formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively adding another multiplication by 3 and then adding 1. So, the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But since each term is nested within the previous one, it's a bit more involved. However, by breaking it down into layers, it becomes clear how each part contributes to the total.\n\nI could also represent this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. If I consider the expression starting from the innermost layer, each step adds another term multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Expanding this would give a sum where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, multiplied by 1, but I have to account for the multiplications correctly.\n\nLet me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, the innermost 1 + 3 is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, which is exactly what I did before. So, expanding step by step is the straightforward approach here.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might be a way, but I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here because each term depends on the previous one in a linear way.\n\nWait, let me try to express the entire expression as a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let's denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I let the inner part be T, then S = 3*T, where T = 1 + 3*(another inner expression). But this seems recursive, which brings me back to the original problem. So, perhaps the geometric series approach isn't directly applicable here because each term is not a simple multiple of the previous term; instead, each term is a function of the previous term multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, it's more of a linear recurrence than a geometric series.\n\nIn any case, since I already have the answer through two different methods\u2014step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation\u2014I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result. It's always good to verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, and I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me just confirm the multiplication again because sometimes even simple steps can have errors.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreaking it down digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using another method of multiplication.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 can be thought of as (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Let me check that:\n\n30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000\n476 \u00d7 3 = 1,428\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, that confirms the multiplication is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 by adding 29,524 three times:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. That also works. So, yes, 88,572 is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me check if the layers were computed correctly. Maybe I can compute a few layers again to see if I made any mistake in the progression.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Let's see, the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, it's easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before. But maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me check for n=5: a_5 should be (3^6 -1)/2 =729 -1=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

But wait, let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer one by one again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives us 88,572. Wait, but I just noticed something. The original expression is 3*(...), but when I started labeling the layers, I started at Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3. But let's count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, after the initial 3, there are nine layers: each time, 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(...) which is the innermost. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 88,572. But let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears after the initial 3. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) 4. 1+3(...) 5. 1+3(...) 6. 1+3(...) 7. 1+3(...) 8. 1+3(...) 9. 1+3(...) So, yes, nine layers. So, my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can solve it iteratively. Alternatively, we can compute a few terms and see if a pattern emerges. Let's compute the first few a_n terms: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.
