    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x    3\n  --------\n    88572\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression to make sure how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+\" has a corresponding opening parenthesis. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my initial computation of Layer 9 as 29524 seems correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But wait, let me check the layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me write down each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it mentally, I might make an error.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because 29524 seems large, but considering that each layer is tripling and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so it's plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's a geometric series or can be expressed recursively. But in this case, a=1 and b=3, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13 L3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, the nth layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b-1). Wait, let me check that. For a linear recurrence like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b-1) + C, but I think in this case, since it's a homogeneous recurrence, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b-1). Let me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nGiven a=1 and b=3, so L_n = (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n} -1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this for n=1: L1= (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1, but earlier I had L1=4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different because the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. Let me compute the first few terms using the formula to see if it matches.\n\nUsing the formula L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2:\n\nn=1: (3 -1)/2=1, but L1=4. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1}=0, whose solution is L_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches L1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, and it gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify the calculations once more.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nThen, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step triples the previous result and adds 1. So, the growth is exponential, which is why the numbers get large quickly.\n\nLet me also try to compute the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), the expression can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers.\n\nBut using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series, which is a*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, the first term when n=1 is 4, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, the nth term would be 4*(3^{n-1}).\n\nWait, but actually, the layers are L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, so it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach.\n\nIn any case, I've verified the result multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Using this pattern, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nWait, because n starts at 1 for the innermost layer, so the outermost layer is layer 9, so n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * [(3^{10} - 1)/2] = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. It's always good to verify using two different methods to be sure. So, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, which increases my confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. As I computed earlier, that's 88,572. Wait, but I feel like such a large number might be correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication. Let me verify 29524 * 3 once again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me try that again more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carry-over 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carry-over 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carry-over 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 (the next digit to the left, which is the ten-thousands place) * 3 = 27. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, after the 2 in the thousands place, we have 9 in the ten-thousands place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, the digits are:\n\n- 4 (units): 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 (tens): 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 5 (hundreds): 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9 (thousands): 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2 (ten thousands): 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), which is 88,572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was computing each layer, I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. From the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), which is the outermost.\n\n- Inside that, the next layer is (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs, which is 9 times. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric progression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\). Each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - The entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 \\)\n   - Compute \\( 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.

But let me verify using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then multiply each by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears before the last \"1+3\". Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first \"1+\" is Layer 1: 1+3\n- Then, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+\" is the start of a new layer, so how many \"1+\" are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1+\"s, but each is nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I think that's correct because each \"1+\" is a new layer. So, I think my initial calculation was right, and the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the layers again step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). According to my method, this would be:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yep, that's correct. So, my method works for a smaller version, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem as well.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost layer). Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4; n=2: a2=1 + 3*4=13; n=3: a3=1 + 3*13=40; and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a9=88572. This approach also seems valid, and it's consistent with my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each term is a linear function of the previous term, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible and perhaps more straightforward.\n\nWait, but just for fun, let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I considered both step-by-step computation and a more advanced method using recurrence relations, and both led me to the same result. I also tested my method on a smaller version of the problem to ensure it works, which it did. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's check what n is. Wait, in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 9 would correspond to n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so n=9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just check the multiplication again, just to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) * 3 = 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out.\n\nAlright, so after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer computation step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's a power of 3. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, you're adding another 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, if I expand it all out, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)). But that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, using the formula I found, since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:  \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous layer).

Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations because that might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nHow many layers are there? Let's see, each time we go out, we add another layer. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, but I'm not sure if the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Wait, no, the initial 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, the layers are the nested 1 + 3*(...) parts. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, Layer1 is 1 + 3, then Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting so large so quickly. Let me check if I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me try computing each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, and the innermost is the first layer.\n\nThus, with n=9, a9=29524, and 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to think about this problem. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each term is 1 + 3*(next term), so starting from the innermost term, each step is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our case, it's a finite nested expression, so it's a finite number of terms, not an infinite series.\n\nBut perhaps we can model it as a sum. Let me think.\n\nWait, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with 9 threes.\n\nWait, maybe another way to represent this is to consider that each layer adds a power of 3.\n\nWait, from the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a9= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps each layer contributes a term that is 3^k, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps if I expand the entire expression, I can see a pattern.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step, writing each layer as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 =1 + 12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1 and then multiplies by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with n=9.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=9 layers, so the formula we derived earlier applies.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that each layer is adding 1 and then scaling by 3, so the entire expression can be seen as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, let's consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a_1=4.\n\nSo, the solution is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is finite, so it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but from the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked each layer step by step, and the formula seems to hold. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term), starting from the innermost term 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29,524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. 3(1+3(...) 3. 3(1+3(...) 4. 3(1+3(...) 5. 3(1+3(...) 6. 3(1+3(...) 7. 3(1+3(...) 8. 3(1+3(...) 9. 3(1+3(...))))) So, there are 9 layers inside the first 3. So, I think my earlier computation is correct, with 9 layers, each computed as above, leading to Layer 9 being 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few layers again. Let me compute Layers 1 through 3 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems consistent. Hmm, but I just have a feeling that maybe I'm missing something because the numbers get large quickly, but I don't see a mistake in my calculations. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which makes me more confident that this is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. Expanding this, L_n = 3*(3*L_{n-2} +1) +1 =3^2*L_{n-2} +3 +1. Continuing this, L_n =3^{n-1}*L_1 +3^{n-2} +3^{n-3}+...+3^1 +1. Since L_1=4, L_n=4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} -1)/(3-1). Wait, because the sum of a geometric series from k=1 to m is (3^{m} -1)/(3-1). So, in this case, the sum would be from k=1 to n-1, so (3^{n-1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n=4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} -1)/2. Let me combine these terms: L_n = (8*3^{n-1} +3^{n-1} -1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. But 9*3^{n-1}=3^{2}*3^{n-1}=3^{n+1}, so L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the same formula I derived earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm that it's 59,049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 -1=59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern in the recursive formula, we determine that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find the value of the innermost expression and then compute each subsequent layer. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   Starting with \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General Solution**: Recognize that this is a linear recurrence relation.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was computing each layer manually, I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 9 layers, which matches my previous computation. So, the closed-form formula gives a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a linear recurrence, so using the closed-form is more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the value using a loop or iteration, but since I'm doing it manually, the step-by-step approach works.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. If each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution, as I found earlier, is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that this is correct. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and even a bit of formula derivation. All point to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\). The layers are computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4.

So, putting it together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer. So, I feel confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula and confirm the result through step-by-step computation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 88,572. So, is the answer 88,572? Wait, that seems quite large. Let me check my computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)) nine times. So, does that mean that the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88,572. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, in the original expression, each \"1+\" is followed by 3*(...), and each of those has another \"1+\" and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, the inner expression is another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the string: \"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the expression ends with nine closing parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time after a closing parenthesis, there's another 1+3(...\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse it as follows:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). The number of times this occurs is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. But each \"1+3(\" is part of a layer. So, actually, each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*Layer8, and then multiplied that by 3. But if there are nine layers, maybe I need to go one more step? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer3), and so on until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(...). But actually, how many layers are there? Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is Layer1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1).\n\nLayer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2).\n\nThis continues until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8).\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers inside the outermost 3 are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the 3. So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that was the value of Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a similar expression but with fewer layers, say 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3). That would be 3*(4) = 12.\n\nIf we have 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute that: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, according to my earlier method, Layer1: 4, Layer2: 13, then 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Compute innermost: 4. Then Layer2: 1 + 3*4 =13. Then Layer3: 1 + 3*13=40. Then 3*40=120. So, the result is 120.\n\nWait, let me compute it directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to hold for smaller numbers. Therefore, it's likely correct for the larger expression.\n\nSo, going back, Layer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? It seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nSuppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 + 3*13=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na_5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nNow, the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n?\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume the particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88,572. So, the final result should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let me verify each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 24*3=72, write down 2, carry over 7. 24 is the units place, so moving to the tens place: 2*3=6 +7=13, write down 3, carry over 1. Next, hundreds place: 5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carry over 1. Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. 29,524 * 3 can be broken down as (30,000 - 476) * 3. 30,000 *3=90,000. 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that this expression is a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. This seems to follow a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59,049. So, a9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29,524=88,572. So, yes, that confirms the result again. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is building a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Since we have 9 layers, the expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 ones. But using the closed-form formula seems more efficient. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form solution, and double-checking the arithmetic, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it more efficiently, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step manually might be feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a recursive formula I can use. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads me to the same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given the recurrence: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the general formula also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponentiation directly. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to 3^n, but adjusted by the constants. But in this case, using the formula seems more straightforward. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can compute each a_n based on the previous term. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 is the term we need before multiplying by 3. So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, if I were to compute it using the closed-form formula, I could write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, this gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked enough to be sure. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

So Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Wait, but I feel like there's a pattern here that might be an arithmetic or geometric sequence. Maybe I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Wait, no, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Hmm, so the recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series. Let me see if that's the case. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Now, since there are 9 layers, that would mean we compute up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try that. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer using the closed-form expression. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative method and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a recursive relationship. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've got it right. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step and then finding a general formula helped a lot. I don't think I made any calculation errors since both methods gave me the same result. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent, let me confirm 3^10.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is29524.\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series where each term is 3^n, but with a twist because each step adds 1 before multiplying by 3.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach is solid here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n- By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we can find the value of each layer up to the ninth.\n\n- Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to find a closed-form solution, which confirms the step-by-step result.\n\n- Finally, multiplying the ninth layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=3, each time we do 1 + 3n. But in our case, it's starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. So, each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it another way to confirm: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 3*3=9 +1=10. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer 9 again and then multiply by 3. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8. Layer8 is 9841. So 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, Layer9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 3*3=9, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after 2, there's another digit? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 ones. So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, digit 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, digit 7. Next: 5*3=15, digit 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, digit 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, digit 8. Next: 3*3=9, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so after the 2 in the ten thousands place, we have 9 in thousands, 5 in hundreds, 2 in tens, 4 in ones. So when multiplying 29524 by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 2 (ten thousands place) *3=6, write 6. So the number is 6 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by substituting the previous layer's result, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives the result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me retrace the layers to make sure each step was correct.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 +39 =40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 =1 +120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when I do repeated multiplications, I might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this more efficiently instead of calculating each layer manually.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. It looks like a linear recurrence, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me see if I can find a pattern or solve the recurrence.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + d, where d is a particular solution. Let's find d.\n\nAssume the steady-state solution L = a*L + b => L - a*L = b => L(1 - a) = b => L = b/(1 - a).\n\nHere, a=3, so L = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * C - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = 3^{n}*(3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm once more. I think I might have made a miscalculation in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 +3=4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 +3*(4)=13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next:1 +3*13=40 (Layer3)\n4. Next:1 +3*40=121 (Layer4)\n5. Next:1 +3*121=364 (Layer5)\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1093 (Layer6)\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280 (Layer7)\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841 (Layer8)\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524 (Layer9)\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so Layer9 is correct. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it, and it matches.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again to be absolutely certain. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Correct.\n\nThus, (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recursive computation. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be computed using \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For Layer 9, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me double-check my computations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in such a long chain. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting with Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, the problem is to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3, since the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we saw earlier. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which is faster and less error-prone. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula. Let me rederive it quickly. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C=1 +3*C => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Using a_1=4: 4= A*3^1 -1/2 =>4=3A -1/2 =>3A=4 +1/2=9/2 =>A= (9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Correct. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula for the entire expression, which is 3*(3^{n} -1)/2 where n=9, but wait, no, because the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014give the same result.

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check each step again because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, same result. So the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I correctly computed each layer. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again because one mistake in an earlier layer would propagate through all the subsequent layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. So 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Let me think if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D. To find the steady-state solution, set a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Then D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88,572. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me just verify each layer's computation again to ensure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. Great, the formula works. So, since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. But since each layer is nested, it's actually a finite geometric series with 9 terms, but the way it's structured, it's more like a geometric progression with each term being 3 times the previous. Wait, but in our case, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a bit different. But since we've already found a closed-form solution, perhaps that's the most efficient way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: If I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) but wait, that's similar to S = 3*(1 + S/3). Wait, is that correct? Let me see: If I let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) then the inner part is similar to S, but not exactly. Wait, actually, the inner expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to S/3. Let me try that. Let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Then, if I remove the outermost 3, the inner part is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to S/3, but only with 8 layers. Hmm, maybe that approach complicates things. Alternatively, since we already have the closed-form solution, maybe it's better to stick with that. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually using the formula and see if they match. For example, n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121, which matches my earlier calculation. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous layer).

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me set L_n = C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm the answer. Therefore, I think the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach seems to back it up. So, I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake in carrying over. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can add 29,524 three times to verify:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make it easier. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, these numbers seem familiar. Wait, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me check if each term is following a certain recurrence relation. Each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, yes, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That makes sense because each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(the next layer).\n\nWait, but in my calculation, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, which is 1 + 3*4. So, yes, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me think about that. Since each term is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say Layer n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems to work. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another set. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time I add another 1 + 3(...). Wait, no, the original expression starts with 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Wait, no, let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n3. Then, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8).\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, and 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to model this. Let me think again. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, starting from Layer 1=4, Layer 2=13, etc., up to Layer 9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, each Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Layer9=3*(3^10 -1)/2=(3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step manually again, layer by layer, just to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, if I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This would expand into 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, because each layer adds another power of 3. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, so Layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, so Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nBut the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k is (3^{m+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(sum of 3^k from k=0 to 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2=88,572.\n\nSo, all these methods point to the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the geometric series approach give the same result. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). This results in each layer being the sum of powers of 3 up to that point. The final computation after expanding all layers and multiplying by 3 yields the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous result. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems to follow a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is given by a_n = r^n * (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) + c/(1 - r). Let me check that. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, a_n = 3^n * (a_0 + 1/2) - 1/2. Now, what is a_0? Since a_1 = 4, which is the first term after the innermost parentheses. So, a_1 = 4. Let's see if this formula works for n=1. a_1 = 3^1 * (a_0 + 1/2) - 1/2. We have a_1 = 4, so 4 = 3*(a_0 + 1/2) - 1/2. Let's solve for a_0: 4 + 1/2 = 3*(a_0 + 1/2) => 4.5 = 3*(a_0 + 0.5) => Divide both sides by 3: 1.5 = a_0 + 0.5 => a_0 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. That makes sense because the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, so before that, it's just 1. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 3^n * (1 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^n * (3/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, then each subsequent layer goes up to a_9. Because the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I reached the outermost layer, which was 29,524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result, 88,572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to use a formula to compute the nth term directly, which also gave me 29,524 for the ninth layer, leading to the same final result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but given the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I saw the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: Starting after the first 3, the first ( is 1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer is added by another \"1+3(\", so starting from the innermost as Layer 1, and moving outward, there are 9 layers. So, I think my initial count was correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost. So, 3*(Layer 9)=88572. So, maybe that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step, writing down each value to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it from top to bottom: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, after computing each layer correctly and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\nSimplify 3*A*3^{n-1} to A*3^n:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let's think about it.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(something). If we expand this, each layer can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let's try to expand the innermost layers and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait a minute, this looks like a geometric series where each layer adds another term of 3^n.\n\nSo, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's the same as our closed-form solution earlier. So, indeed, each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nHence, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it iteratively, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be certain that the solution is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, I was able to compute each layer step by step. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed my iterative result. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gave me the final answer of 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841.

Let me compute that again. 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, another way to compute 29524*3 is to add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: Let's add 29,524 + 29,524. 20,000 + 20,000 = 40,000. 9,000 + 9,000 = 18,000. 500 + 500 = 1,000. 20 + 20 = 40. 4 + 4 = 8. So adding those together: 40,000 + 18,000 = 58,000 + 1,000 = 59,000 + 40 = 59,040 + 8 = 59,048. Then add the third 29,524: 59,048 + 29,524. Let's break it down: 50,000 + 20,000 = 70,000. 9,000 + 9,000 = 18,000. 500 + 500 = 1,000. 40 + 20 = 60. 8 + 4 = 12. So adding those: 70,000 + 18,000 = 88,000 + 1,000 = 89,000 + 60 = 89,060 + 12 = 89,072. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, that can't be right because 29524*3 should be the same regardless of the method. I must have made a mistake in one of the addition steps. Let me try adding 29,524 + 29,524 again. 29,524 + 29,524:\n\n29,524\n+29,524\n--------\nLet's add units place: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nTens place: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nHundreds place: 5 + 5 = 10. Write down 0, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18, plus the carried 1 makes 19. Write down 9, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands place: 2 + 2 = 4, plus the carried 1 makes 5.\n\nSo, 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Correct.\n\nNow, adding another 29,524:\n\n59,048 + 29,524.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3*(Layer9), but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is exactly what I computed. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). With f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, so f(9) = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. Using the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, set equal to left side:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then 3*f(n) = 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2 = (3^(n+2) -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*f(9) = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. Therefore, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtracting 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's apply the initial condition. The first layer, L_1, is 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f That's the same result as before. So, the final computation is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for L_n, I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same answer. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Reaching the outermost layer (Layer 9) gives us 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should compute Layer 9 again just to confirm. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 That seems correct.

Hmm, but wait a minute, I feel like this might be too large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So starting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first, then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Layer3:1+3(Layer2). Layer4:1+3(Layer3). Layer5:1+3(Layer4). Layer6:1+3(Layer5). Layer7:1+3(Layer6). Layer8:1+3(Layer7). Layer9:1+3(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's 9 layers. So, my calculation seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer step by step again, just in case I made an error in one of the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Wait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D. Then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9. So, Layer9 is 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then 29,524*3=88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it without using the formula, just to see if I get the same result. Let's compute each layer again, but this time, compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost. Starting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost is (1+3) = 4. Then moving one layer out: (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same answer. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the final value after all layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then inside, we have 1 + 3(...). Each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set is 1 + 3(...), and each time, we have another layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)) inside the main 3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers inside, right? So, starting from layer 1 as 1 + 3, up to layer 9, which is the outermost one before the main 3. So, when I computed up to layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that should be correct.

Let's compute this manually.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nThe recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved as follows:\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a smaller example to verify the method, and even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value before the outermost multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, recognizing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, which could lead to a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a moment. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since we're only going up to a_9, maybe computing each term step by step is simpler. However, for future reference, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 29,524*3=88,572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might make it easier. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that this is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence, and the closed-form formula helps avoid computing each layer manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
