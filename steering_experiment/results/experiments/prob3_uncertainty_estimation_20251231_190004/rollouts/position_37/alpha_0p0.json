Let me check with another method. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).

Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it works for the larger problem. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer step by step.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, that's accurate. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, that's right. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer is built by adding another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we calculated before. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. So, the value of the expression is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation part, since 3^11 is a large number. Let me confirm 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. All right, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify one more time, perhaps using a different approach, to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a form of a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step as I did before is manageable. However, for thoroughness, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524*3. Let's compute this carefully. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So reading it backwards: 2,7,7,5,7,6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me try again. Actually, it's easier to compute 29524*3 by breaking it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me check that. Yes, because starting from the innermost, a_1=1+3=4. Then a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1+12=13, which is correct. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug this into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the proposed solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as a function of the number of layers. Let me see: If there are k layers, then the value would be 3*a_k, where a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(3^{k+1} -1)/2. In our case, k=9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if there are many layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and found that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. Alternatively, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found that each layer n evaluates to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches confirm the same result. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Let me try another way to compute 3 * 29524 to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think I did that correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then proceeding to the next layer. Starting from the innermost, which was just 4, and working my way out, each time the numbers got significantly larger because of the multiplication by 3. It's a geometric progression kind of situation, but with each term being 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, each term is 3n +1, where n is the previous term. It's a bit like a recursive sequence. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have a general case where it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))), with n layers, is there a closed-form formula? Well, in this problem, n is 9, but maybe for understanding, let's consider the pattern. Let's denote a_k as the value of the expression with k layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I can see that each a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, I think. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for the first few terms. For k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe that's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm just computing up to L_9, maybe it's faster to compute each term as I did before. But perhaps I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the values I obtained:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 13\n\nL3: 40\n\nL4: 121\n\nL5: 364\n\nL6: 1093\n\nL7: 3280\n\nL8: 9841\n\nL9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Which makes sense because L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each term is 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express this as a geometric series. Let me see. Let's try to unroll the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2})\n\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, after k steps:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{k}*L_{n - k}\n\nIf we go all the way down to L1, then L_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*L1\n\nBut L1 is 4, so:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * L1\n\nWait, actually, that might not be exactly accurate. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from L_n:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-2}\n\nSubstituting back:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, L_{n-2} = 1 + 3*L_{n-3}\n\nSo, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this process, after expanding all the way to L1:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * L1\n\nSince L1 = 4, then:\n\nL_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^{n} * 4\n\nWait, let me verify that. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with ratio 3, so the sum is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^{n} * 4\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nL_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n\n\n= (3^n - 1 + 8*3^n)/2\n\n= (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nWait, 4*3^n is equal to (8*3^n)/2, so:\n\n(3^n - 1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2 = (3^n - 1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nHmm, that seems a bit off because when I plug n=1 into this formula, I should get L1=4.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFor n=1: (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Wait, that's not 4. So, something's wrong with my derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nIf I unroll it completely, it would be:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*L1)...))\n\nWhich would expand to:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1 + 3^n * L1\n\nWait, but L1 is 4, so:\n\nL_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n * 4\n\nWait, but when n=1, L1 = 4. Plugging into the formula:\n\n(3^1 -1)/2 + 3^1 *4 = (3 -1)/2 + 3*4 = 2/2 + 12 = 1 + 12 =13, which is not equal to L1=4. So, clearly, my formula is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try to write the recurrence correctly.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 =4.\n\nSo, for n=1: L1=4\n\nn=2: L2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nn=3: L3=1 +3*13=40\n\nn=4: L4=1 +3*40=121\n\nn=5: L5=1 +3*121=364\n\nn=6: L6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nn=7: L7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nn=8: L8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nn=9: L9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each term is indeed 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nNow, to find a closed-form formula for L_n, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P =3*P +1\n\nSolving for P: P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after verifying with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression, but it's actually a linear recurrence.\n\nBut regardless, by computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a formula, I arrived at the same answer both ways, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, perhaps, to find a formula for a_n. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each layer was calculated correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. I guess that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the answer again. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. That might have been faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Anyway, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach confirmed it. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, right. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, yes. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer. That's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: The solution to the recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For n=9 (the innermost layer), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, as before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting n = 1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's plug in the general form into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, substitute B back into the equation from n=1:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with our earlier results to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, using this, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(L_9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think about it. The entire expression is 3*(L_9). From the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches our previous result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 88,572.

So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches my earlier computations. So, this seems consistent.

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, we get 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*a_1 + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + m*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, m=1. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1=4, which is after the first layer. So maybe the number of layers is 9, so n=9. Let me try to model it with this formula. So, a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 +3*a_1 =1 +3*4=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can derive it. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 =1 +3*4=13. a_3=1 +3*13=40. a_4=1 +3*40=121. a_5=1 +3*121=364. a_6=1 +3*364=1093. a_7=1 +3*1093=3280. a_8=1 +3*3280=9841. a_9=1 +3*9841=29524. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n =3*a_{n-1}, which is A*3^n. The particular solution would be a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the innermost expression, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^10 is 59049, correct. 59049-1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 29,524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the expression has nine layers, each multiplying by 3, it might add up.

Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of the operation: 1 + 3*(previous result). This is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this can be seen as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. That's correct, a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Perfect, that's the same as we calculated earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we compute up to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a pattern where each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9 first using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of '(', after the first 3, there are nine '('. So, each '(' corresponds to a layer. So, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1+3, then a_2, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to expand the expression step by step, but that might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The solution we found was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check with n=4 just to be sure.\n\nFrom earlier, a_4 was 121. Using the formula: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364.

Adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in the calculations, especially with the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute this carefully. 29,524 * 3: Break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) *3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but I just realized that the original problem has nine layers, each with 1 + 3(...). Wait, let me count the number of times the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times the innermost expression is 1+3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count them: 1. (1+3\n2. (1+3\n3. (1+3\n4. (1+3\n5. (1+3\n6. (1+3\n7. (1+3\n8. (1+3\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, there are nine (1+3(...) terms. Wait, but each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I actually have nine layers, each adding one more layer. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Each layer is f applied to the previous result. So, starting from x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = f(x\u2080) = 1 + 3*1 = 4; x\u2082 = f(x\u2081) = 1 + 3*4 = 13; x\u2083 = f(x\u2082) = 1 + 3*13 = 40; and so on, up to x\u2089, then the final result is 3*x\u2089. So, in general, each x_{n} = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x\u2080 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for x_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}. Plugging in the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is x_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition x\u2080 = 1. When n=0: x\u2080 = A*3^0 - 1/2 = A*1 - 1/2 = A - 1/2 = 1. So, A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, x\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29,524. Then, the final result is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, using the closed-form formula, we get the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 3x + 1. After n steps, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, n=9, so x\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.

Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Wait, hold on, earlier I had Layer 9 as 29,524, but now it's coming out to 29,523. Did I make a mistake here? Let me check the computation again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27,000. 800*3=2,400. 40*3=120. 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Wait, no. Wait, no, the expression is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9,841. So, 3*9,841 is 29,523, and then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, that's correct. Then, the final step is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. But to be thorough, let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each term step by step. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it's usually of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation where Layer 9 was 29,524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 29524 * 3 = 88,572, as I computed earlier. Hmm, seems consistent. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to approach it, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's consider the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let me compute A. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as 88,572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which again gives the same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, the sum after n layers would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found. Therefore, after 9 layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88,572. So, that's another way to see it without computing each layer manually. I think that's solid. So, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again because 3*3280 is 9840, right? 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Yes, that's correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 9840*3. Wait, no, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAssume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n might dominate, but since our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let's find B.\n\nAssume particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is useful.\n\nBut since the problem is given with nine layers, using the formula might be more efficient, but in any case, both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or reasoning. Each step follows logically, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula method give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer from the inside out:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me write down each step again concisely: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression, which might help confirm my result without computing each layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Now, let's compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the closed-form approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k=3, c=1. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can find A. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me think about expanding the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). If I expand this, each layer adds another term with 3^k. Let me try to write it out. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, expanding all the way, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to check. Wait, actually, when you have such nested expressions, each multiplication by 3 corresponds to a power. Let me see: If I have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), then each layer adds a 3^k term. For example, after expanding, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n. But in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each layer adds another term. Wait, actually, when I computed a_n, I found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, as before. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Instead of computing each layer step by step, I can recognize the pattern and use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, the sum up to n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I found earlier. Therefore, after computing up to 9 layers, we get (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192; 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279; 3000+279=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check another way: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, when you have a nested expression like this, it might form a geometric series or follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method also leads us to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure that there are no calculation errors. I think I've spent enough time thinking through this problem, breaking it down, and checking my work. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression without computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, if there were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a closed-form formula. But in this case, nine steps are manageable.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check a couple of the layers again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

I think I did each step correctly, so I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term and working through each layer, we compute each step carefully. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:** Substitute Layer 1 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:** Substitute Layer 2 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:** Substitute Layer 3 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:** Substitute Layer 4 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:** Substitute Layer 5 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:** Substitute Layer 6 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:** Substitute Layer 7 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:** Substitute Layer 8 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
