    "text": " Each subsequent term is a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The formula for a_n in such a case is a_n = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case. Wait, but let me check that. The standard formula for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see. Let me define a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations or the reasoning. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.

Let me see, for n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. According to the formula, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to model the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if we can find a pattern. a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, as before, the total expression is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this recurrence relation as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, that's a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations. a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

To solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.

The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is straightforward. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to 3^n, but let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " So, in general, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The general formula for a_n when a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = k^n*a_0 + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1). In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3, c = 1. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but if we consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which is correct. So, using the formula: a_n = 3^n*a_0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). Since a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. So, general solution for a_n where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1: The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, that's the formula for a_n. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a sum, it's similar to expanding a geometric series multiple times. But in this case, since each layer is dependent on the previous one, it's more efficient to use the recurrence relation or compute step by step. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nBy recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the form $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, and each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The standard solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^(p) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So the general solution for a_n where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

    "text": " Each step, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r = 3, c = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4, etc. So, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/ (3 - 1). Wait, but a_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form solution.

    "text": " So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute a few terms to see if that formula holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But wait, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Let's think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Which matches our earlier calculation of Layer 2=13. Similarly, for n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Which is Layer 3=40. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute this using the formula directly: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n-1} + (a_1 - c)/(1 - r) * r^{n-1} Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, r = 3, c = 1. The general solution is a_n = (a_1) * r^{n-1} + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me verify that formula. Let me compute a few terms using this formula.

Compute each term: 4*6561: 4*6000=24000, 4*500=2000, 4*61=244. So, 24000 + 2000=26000, +244=26244. Next, (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. So, a_9=26244 + 3280=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u21d2 K - 3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: n=1, a1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

    "text": " Each subsequent term is a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1) when starting from a_0 = 1, but in this case, the starting point is a_1 = 4, and each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait, let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Each layer is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier computation. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, for such a linear recurrence, the solution is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but here a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be undefined? Or perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think. If I consider n starting from 1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I need to find a_0 such that when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let me set up the equation: a_1 = 3*a_0 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But a_1 is given as 4, so 3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me combine these terms: 3^{n} can be written as (2*3^{n})/2, so adding (3^{n} -1)/2 gives (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to compute each layer step by step without using the formula, I would have gotten the same result, as I did earlier. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. By recognizing this pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), we find a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
