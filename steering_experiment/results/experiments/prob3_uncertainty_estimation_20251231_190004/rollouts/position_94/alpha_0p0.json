    "text": " This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

Then A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.

Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. Good. So, using this formula, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result. So, this method also gives the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct.

So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we computed. Then each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find B by considering the steady-state solution when a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9. So, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation of Layer 9 being 29524. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using both methods, I get the same answer, which is good. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which equals 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Then, a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Rearranging, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + (1 + 2c). To make this a homogeneous equation, we set 1 + 2c = 0, so c = -1/2. Therefore, the substitution is b_n = a_n - 1/2. Then, b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. So, the solution is b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n + 1/2 = b_1 * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Now, find b_1: a_1 = 4 = b_1 + 1/2, so b_1 = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2. Therefore, a_n = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (7 * 3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (7 * 3^{8} + 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, a_9 = (7*6561 + 1)/2 = (45927 + 1)/2 = 45928/2 = 22964. Wait, but earlier I computed a_9 as 29524. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in either the recurrence approach or in the step-by-step computation. Let me check both. First, the step-by-step computation: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 So, a_9 = 29524. But according to the formula, a_9 = (7*3^8 + 1)/2 = (7*6561 + 1)/2 = (45927 + 1)/2 = 45928/2 = 22964. That's different. So, one of them must be wrong. Let me check the recurrence relation again. The original recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a_2 using the formula: a_2 = (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11. But in my step-by-step, a_2 is 13. So, the formula is giving a different result, which means I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Wait, perhaps the substitution was incorrect. Let me try again. Let me define b_n = a_n + c, and try to find c such that the recurrence becomes homogeneous. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, b_n = a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c. But we want b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, so 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Expanding the right side: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. So, 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Subtracting 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + c = 3c. So, 1 = 2c, hence c = 1/2. Therefore, b_n = a_n + 1/2. Then, the recurrence becomes b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. So, b_n is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. Therefore, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Now, b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Now, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2. 3^8 is 6561, so 9*6561 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the step-by-step computation. So, earlier, I made a mistake in the substitution; the correct substitution is b_n = a_n + 1/2, not -1/2. Therefore, the formula is a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = 29524, which is consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(9*3^{8} - 1)/2 = (27*3^{8} - 3)/2. But 3^{9} is 19683, so 27*3^8 = 3^{3}*3^{8} = 3^{11} = 177147. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 27*3^8 = 3^{3}*3^{8} = 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's consistent as well. So, both methods lead to the same result, confirming that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid now. I just need to make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me recompute the layers quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.
