    "text": " So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me cross-verify my steps because the numbers are getting large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps L_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_0 is 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, using the formula for linear recurrences: L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Plugging in a=3, b=1, L_0=1: L_n = 3^n * 1 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying: L_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern, derived a formula for the nth term, verified it with known values, and then used it to compute the 9th term. Then, multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Cross-checked using two different methods to ensure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check each layer computation because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.

Wait, earlier I had 1 + 3*121 = 364? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 3*121 is 363, right? 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. So Layer 5 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1=1+12=13, L3=1+3*L2=1+39=40, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see: Let's consider that each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L1=(3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L9=(3^(10) -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we get the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same answer. Either way, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my computations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step calculation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result.

Let me recount the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me some computation. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for this. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, this formula works.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 4, so maybe we need to adjust the indices. Let me think. Let me define L_0 = 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=1, with L_0 =1. So, the general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + d, where C is a constant and d is the particular solution. To find d, we set L_n = d, then d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d =1 => d= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_0 =1: L_0 = C*3^0 -1/2 = C -1/2 =1 => C = 1 +1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, let's compute that. First, compute L_9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula was a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, though it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. So, just to recap: The problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can model it as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution, which allows us to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also works, as I did initially, but it's more prone to errors, especially with more layers. Either way, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by recognizing a repeating pattern in the nested parentheses. \n\nEach layer of the expression follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we can find the value of the entire expression.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9 because when I started, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), but perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are. Let me go back and check. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is layer 1. Then each 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), but each layer is nested inside the previous one. So when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if that's correct by computing each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So my computation up to Layer 9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. For example, let's say I have a similar expression with fewer layers and check if my approach works.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute the expression directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So my method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAnother check: Let's take a 2-layer version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nDirect computation: 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me set it up properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's 3^n, but let me think about it. Wait, the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is actually the sum of a geometric series. Since each a_n is built by adding 1 and 3 times the previous term, which is a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nIndeed, the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series starting with 1 and ratio 3 is (3^n -1)/2. But in our case, the formula is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is similar but shifted by one power because the recurrence starts at a_1 =4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2.\n\nSo, to confirm, the expression is a geometric series sum, which makes sense given the structure of the problem.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked it multiple ways, and each method confirms the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we'll compute it step by step by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, just to cross-verify. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1=4, L2=1 + 3*L1, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. Let me check: When n=1, L1= A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents. That's a much faster method. So, in the future, if I see such nested expressions, I can recognize them as geometric series or use recurrence relations to find a closed-form solution, which would save a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was able to compute each layer manually without making a mistake, that also worked. So, in conclusion, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\), which can be solved using a formula.

Using the formula for the nth layer, \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we find the value of the innermost layer and work outward. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested pattern: Each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).\n2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nNow, the original problem is to compute 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo that's another way to compute it, which confirms the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods led me to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive structure, so perhaps I can model it as a geometric series or find a formula for it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can see the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, the coefficient of 3 increases exponentially. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let's denote the entire expression as E. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) and see if I can find a pattern. Wait, but that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, since I've already found a closed-form expression for a_n, where a_n is the value after n layers, and E = 3*a_9, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also using a formula approach, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that this expression is a geometric series, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for thoroughness, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a solution of the form A*3^n + B, substitute into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster. Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because our initial terms are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nHmm, so the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that's (3^{11}-3)/2. Compute 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the iterative approach and the formula approach, verified each step, and arrived at the same conclusion. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Formula**: Solving the recurrence gives \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For \\(n=9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let\u2019s assume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1=4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Then, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147.

I don't see any mistakes in my computations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about it another way. Each time, you have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined recursively. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it matches. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, since each layer n contributes to the next, and we have 9 layers, the final result is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). But let's compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that the result is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the multiplication for 3*29524. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, this can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3 + B. For n=0, perhaps a_0 would be 1? Wait, no, because the innermost term is a_1=1+3=4. Wait, maybe a_0=1, then a_1=1+3*a_0=1+3*1=4, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+3*4=13, etc. So, if we consider a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1. Then, the solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For k=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For k=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general term is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the step-by-step computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute the result without having to go through each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, both methods work fine. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach yield the same result. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value at each step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to make sure. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers. But since I only had 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation, I cross-verified using the formula, and both gave me the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc., up to L9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I can see if there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Since each L_n is a linear recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me write that down: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)}=C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. When n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2= (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L9= (3^{10})/2 -1/2= (59049)/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, L9=29524, and the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a recurrence relation, solved it, and confirmed the result with the closed-form formula. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.

    "text": " So the final result is 88,572. Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 +3*13=40, Layer 4:1 +3*40=121, Layer5:1 +3*121=364, Layer6:1 +3*364=1093, Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280, Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841, Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. This confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, expanding the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be represented as a sum of 3^n terms. But in this case, since the expression is finite with 9 layers, using the recurrence relation was more straightforward. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, or by using the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It looks like each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result.

Then, 3 * 29524: As computed earlier, it's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that would be helpful. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 + (b)/(1 - a)) - (b)/(1 - a). Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*( (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) ). In this case, a=3, b=1, and L_0 would be the initial term. But in our case, L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me set n=1: L_1 = 4. Using the formula: L_1 = 3^{1} * L_0 + 1*( (3^{1} - 1)/(3 - 1) ) => 4 = 3*L_0 + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3L_0 + 1. So, 3L_0 = 3 => L_0 = 1. So, the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * 1 + 1*( (3^{n} - 1)/2 ). Simplifying: L_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula without computing each layer. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9). And L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, maybe? Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me think about how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Since there are nine layers, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive expression where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, starting from 4. If I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this can be represented as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, which could be easier for computation. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I end up with the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is constant, so a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in this case, since we have a fixed number of layers, it's easier to compute each layer step by step or use the formula. Either way, the result is the same.

So, I think I did each step correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The formula for a_n is a_n = (1/ (1 - r)) * (r^n - 1), but let me think. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by expanding each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L_1=4, each subsequent layer is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. This seems like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. The general formula for such a recurrence is indeed L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, using that, I can compute L_9 directly. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. Just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can add 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B must equal 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did before, which also gave me 88572. So, either way, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, but in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a geometric series. Let me see: The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. If a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with more layers. Let's see if there's a pattern or a recursive formula here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which is the same result. So, using the formula, I can compute the result directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. However, it's good to know the formula in case the problem scales up. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I can compute the result more efficiently. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same answer, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence gives a closed-form formula, and computing the 9th layer yields 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Each step seems straightforward, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
