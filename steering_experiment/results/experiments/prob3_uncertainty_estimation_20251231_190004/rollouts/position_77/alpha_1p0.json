    "text": " Wait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. So that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check my layers again because 88572 seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But let me check another way. Alternatively, this expression is a geometric series in disguise. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*next_layer. So, it's a recursive structure where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me substitute into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes with these nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 1 + 3(...\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each with \"1 + 3(...)\", and then the outermost 3 multiplies the 9th layer. So, a_9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*a_9, which is correct. Therefore, my calculation of a_9 as 29524 and then 3*a_9 = 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach to confirm. Each layer adds another term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me expand the expression step by step. The innermost layer is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression would give me a sum that can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with 9 layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with 9 layers. But actually, since each layer is similar, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but since it's finite, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using the closed-form formula I found earlier is more straightforward. Since I've already computed it using two methods (step-by-step layer computation and the closed-form formula), and both gave me the same result, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate through all the subsequent layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Wait, is there a pattern here? Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear, so we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3}-1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me the same result.

Alternatively, I could see if there's a pattern or formula for such expressions, maybe a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of this formula, the original expression is 3*(L_9), so that's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems to be correct. Wait, but let me check if I've accounted for all the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each opening parenthesis is closed after a certain number of layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the inside, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3 (Layer1) 2. 1+3(1+3) (Layer2) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (Layer3) And so on until Layer9. So I think I correctly computed up to Layer9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. The particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Which matches Layer2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct, as Layer3=40. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting with the innermost layer as \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). By iteratively computing each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, we find each layer's value. Finally, multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me retrace each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate somewhere. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using standard techniques. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier calculations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, we arrive at the same result.

Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. So starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems to be correct. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So the layers are each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, this formula works. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Yes, that's correct. So, the total would be 88,572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13.

That seems consistent. Let me double-check one or two layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - k)) * k^n - c/(1 - k). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Wait, but according to the general solution, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2. But a_1 is 4, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication one more time. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using another multiplication method: 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87,000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each layer can be expressed as a recurrence relation: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. Let me try to find a pattern in the layers. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L1 = 4 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

So, 30000*3 = 90000, and 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, this is a geometric series? Wait, let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was working step by step, it was good to verify. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine terms, it's not necessary. However, it's worth noting that each term is growing exponentially because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see if that formula holds for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. But L1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my formula is off. Let me think again. The standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + b/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. In this case, a=3 and b=1. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * C + 1/(1 - 3) = 3^{n} * C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4. So, 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula would be L_n = (3^{n})*(3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. So, that's the answer. I think I did it correctly, both by step-by-step computation and by using the formula.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can use to confirm this result. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar, which might give me a quicker way to compute the result without expanding each layer.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we have a recurrence relation here. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - c/(1 - r). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nActually, for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1 - d) + d, where d = c/(1 - r), provided that r \u2260 1. In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, here, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*(a_1 - d) + d, where d = c/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = 3^{n-1}*(4 - (-1/2)) + (-1/2) = 3^{n-1}*(4 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^{n-1}*(9/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I've already computed.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging into (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. That's not correct. Hmm, so maybe my general formula is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence by unfolding it:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\n= 3*(3*a_{n-2} + 1) + 1\n\n= 3^2*a_{n-2} + 3 + 1\n\nContinuing this process, after k steps, we get:\n\na_n = 3^{k}*a_{n - k} + (3^{k - 1} + 3^{k - 2} + ... + 3^0)\n\nWhen k = n - 1, we get:\n\na_n = 3^{n - 1}*a_1 + (3^{n - 2} + 3^{n - 3} + ... + 3^0)\n\nWe know that a_1 = 4, and the sum in the parentheses is a geometric series with sum S = (3^{n - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n - 1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\na_n = 3^{n - 1}*4 + (3^{n - 1} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n - 1} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\nLet's factor out 3^{n - 1}:\n\na_n = (8*3^{n - 1} + 3^{n - 1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\n(3^{n + 1} - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut let's test this formula with n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, since a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29000 + 524.\n\n3*29000 = 87000.\n\n3*524 = 1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after all that step-by-step computation and verification using both iterative layer-by-layer calculation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but given that each layer is only one step, perhaps it's faster to compute each layer as I did. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Suppose I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). This is a recursive structure where each term depends on the previous one. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). If I let L_n be the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, with each layer, the value is growing exponentially. Since there are 9 layers, the value increases quite a bit. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, to check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this using the same method. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, same result. So, the method works for a smaller version, so likely correct for the larger one.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but I feel like 88572 is a bit large. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works, and thus, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I used the formula, I calculated a_9 as Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, that should be correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 + 3*something, it's a linear recurrence, which I already solved. So, I think the approach is solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n- Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n- The sequence follows a recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a general formula.\n\n- Using the formula, compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n- All steps checked out, so the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

    "text": " Let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So is that the final answer? Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nWhen n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, as before.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result. So that confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this pattern, we derive a formula for the nth layer and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, with the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Formula**: The nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me see if that works. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the expression, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me try to express it as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...). So, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But S itself is equal to 1 + 3*T, where T is the next layer. But since all layers are similar, T = S as well. Wait, no, because each layer is the same operation. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, maybe the entire expression is a geometric series with 9 terms. Let me see. Let me consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, in total, there are 9 layers. So, perhaps the expression can be written as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in the recurrence relation. As we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let me expand the expression step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me define the innermost as term1: term1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then term2 = 1 + 3*term1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. term3 = 1 + 3*term2 = 40. term4 = 1 + 3*term3 = 121. term5 = 1 + 3*term4 = 364. term6 = 1 + 3*term5 = 1093. term7 = 1 + 3*term6 = 3280. term8 = 1 + 3*term7 = 9841. term9 = 1 + 3*term8 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*term9 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. I think the step-by-step approach is solid. So, just to recap, I computed each layer starting from the innermost, each time plugging the result into the next layer. After computing up to the 9th layer, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the final result seems reasonable given the size of the numbers involved.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.

So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.

So perhaps the layers are 9? Let me see: Starting from the innermost, 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's parse it:\n\n- The outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...)\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the next layer\n- This continues until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?

Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that this expression is a geometric series.

Let me try to count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 8 times \"1+3(\" inside the initial 3(...).

Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since there are only 9 terms, computing each step is manageable. But just for knowledge, the closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial condition is different. Wait, perhaps the formula is different because the recursion starts at a different point. Let me think. The recursion is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed in the calculations, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, I think I'm good here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression.

    "text": " Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 is equal to (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428. Let me compute 90000 - 1428: 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: 1.

Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's take Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+123=29523. 29523 +1=29524.

So, yes, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the entire expression is a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but I think the recurrence approach is clearer here.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using both step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, we find the final result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula seems reliable.

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer can be expressed as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe recognizing that each step is a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

    "text": " Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again: sometimes when I'm dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiplication, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me confirm that each layer is correctly computed. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression, which might save time and reduce errors. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, yes, that's consistent. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D for all n. Then substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication once more: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524\n*      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That confirms it again. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 is the same as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps, using the formula for a geometric series. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try to write this as a sum. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps each layer adds another term in a geometric progression. Let me see: Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers. Wait, but actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of it as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, E2 =1 + 3*E1=1 +12=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1+39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1+120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1+363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1+1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1+3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1+9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for E_n, the nth layer, which is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. As I did before, solving the recurrence relation gives E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Each time you have a 1 plus 3 times something, which can be thought of as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try expanding the entire expression:\n\nLet me write the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me think: Each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1 being multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nSo, each 1 is inside k layers of multiplication by 3, where k ranges from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be expressed as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nEach 1 contributes 3^{k}, where k is the number of times it's been multiplied by 3. Since there are nine layers, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1 being multiplied by 3^0.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the outermost 3 is:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))) = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k.\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1). So, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that's just the sum inside the outermost 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(sum) =3*9841=29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had 88572 as the final answer. So, perhaps my approach here is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms or the exponents. Let me think again.\n\nEach time you have a layer, the 1 is multiplied by 3^{n-1}, where n is the number of layers from that 1 to the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps each 1 is at a different depth. Let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum of 1's each multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above them.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1, which is at depth 8 (since there are 9 layers), so it's multiplied by 3^8.\n\nThen, the next 1 is at depth 7, multiplied by 3^7.\n\nContinuing this way, the outermost 1 is at depth 0, multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the sum inside the outermost 3 is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3.\n\nSum = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9841) =29523.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier result where I computed 88572. So, where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers or the exponents. Let me check the initial expansion again.\n\nWait, when I computed each layer step by step, I found that the innermost 1 +3=4, then each subsequent layer was:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nThen, 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nBut in the geometric series approach, I considered the sum inside the outermost 3 as sum_{k=0}^{8}3^k=9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But that's different. So, where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in how I'm interpreting the layers. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3))))) with nine 1s.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have a 1, it's followed by a 3*(...), so the number of 1s is nine. So, the expression can be written as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 +3=4, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(previous). So, when I expand it step by step, I get Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, etc., up to Layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nBut when I tried the geometric series approach, I thought of the sum inside the outermost 3 as sum_{k=0}^8 3^k=9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which is different. So, that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the sum inside the outermost 3 isn't sum_{k=0}^8 3^k, because each term isn't just 3^k; rather, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, perhaps it's not a simple geometric series, but a more complex structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent each layer as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, as I did before. So, the sum approach might not work directly because each term isn't just a multiple of 3, but each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the expression is a base-3 number or something like that, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider that each layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Then, a2=1 +3*4=13, a3=1 +3*13=40, etc., as before. So, the solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by computing each layer again, step by step:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression using a different method, such as repeatedly expanding the expression.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out:1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*(40)=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*(121)=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*(364)=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*(1093)=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*(3280)=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*(9841)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine 1s. Let me see if there's a pattern in the results:\n\nAfter Layer1:4= (3^2 +1)/1? Wait, 4= (9+1)/2? No, 10/2=5, which is not 4. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, Layer1=4=3+1.\n\nLayer2=13=3*(4)+1=12+1=13.\n\nLayer3=40=3*(13)+1=39+1=40.\n\nLayer4=121=3*(40)+1=120+1=121.\n\nLayer5=364=3*(121)+1=363+1=364.\n\nLayer6=1093=3*(364)+1=1092+1=1093.\n\nLayer7=3280=3*(1093)+1=3279+1=3280.\n\nLayer8=9841=3*(3280)+1=9840+1=9841.\n\nLayer9=29524=3*(9841)+1=29523+1=29524.\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nThus, the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nNow, perhaps I can see a pattern in these numbers. Let me compute the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n13/4=3.25\n\n40/13\u22483.077\n\n121/40=3.025\n\n364/121\u22483.008\n\n1093/364\u22483.000\n\n3280/1093\u22483.000\n\n9841/3280\u22483.000\n\n29524/9841\u22483.000\n\nSo, the ratio approaches 3 as n increases, which makes sense because each term is defined as a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n=3*a_{n-1} +1. So, the homogeneous solution is 3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, as I found before.\n\nSo, the general term is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=9 gives a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nThus, after verifying through multiple methods\u2014step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and checking the pattern\u2014it's clear that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've considered it from all angles and each method confirms that the answer is 88572.

Let me recount the layers step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, is 88572 the final answer? Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the expression, I thought it was 3*(...), but when I started computing, I realized that the innermost parentheses were 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, computing each L_n step by step as I did earlier is the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging back into L_1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4.5 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 4.5 = -0.5. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 0.5 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've got it. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to see if it holds. For example, Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121, which is correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. So, yes, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D is a constant solution. Then, D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_n as above. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as I computed earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until reaching the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.

Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), computing each step as I did before is feasible. However, for a deeper understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this method also confirms the result. I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n is following a pattern where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: If n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check one more time. Starting from the inside: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems consistent.

Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Started from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That forms a geometric sequence, actually. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...))), it's a repeating pattern, which is similar to a geometric series. The general form is x = a + b*x, which can be solved as x = a / (1 - b), but in this case, the nesting is finite, so it's not an infinite series. Wait, but here each layer is x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for x_n. The recurrence is x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern. x1 = 4\n\nx2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nx3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nx4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nx5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nx6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nx7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nx8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nx9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is x_n = 3*x_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of order 1. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is x_n - 3*x_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution x_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = x_n^{(h)} + x_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, x1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: x1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: x2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: x3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.

Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, in our case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the coefficient c is 3, and d is 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = (a_0) * 3^{n} + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. If n starts at 1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, is there a formula or a pattern that could have been used to compute this without manually calculating each layer? Hmm, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, it's L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so it's a bit different. Let me write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a much more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem. I think I've got the correct answer here. To recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value directly, leading us to the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested recurrence relation where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote the entire expression as S. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) But since the inner expression is similar to S, but without the initial 3. Wait, actually, let me think of it recursively. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as we computed. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, since the original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So, in general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until we reach the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't skip a step or miscalculate somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, perhaps using a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine terms, computing each step is manageable. However, just to explore, let's see if there's a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and recognizing the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same result.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me consider the structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.
