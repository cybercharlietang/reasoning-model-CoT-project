Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, which corresponds to n=1, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Wait, no, actually, the way I defined a_n, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 would be the outermost. So, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, because the original expression is 3*(...). Therefore, the total value is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572 as the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern I can exploit. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a form of a number in base 3 or something else, but I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both lead to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, it might be a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute a few terms of this sequence to see if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a_9 is 29524, and then 3*a_9 is 88572. But maybe I can find a formula for a_n without computing each term. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

But wait, let me check my layers again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression that could have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let's define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern initially, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did, and arrived at the same answer. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, that seems correct. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I should check the number of layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, after the first 3, there are 9 layers, right? Because each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, Layer 1: innermost, Layer 9: outermost. So, my computation of Layer 9 as 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute it in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a step-by-step approach, each layer is computed until the outermost expression is reached. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, a closed-form formula confirms the result. The final computation is:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, the sequence would be a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I computed before. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let the inner expression be E', then E = 3*(1 + 3*E'). But E' is similar to E but with one fewer layer. Wait, actually, each time we have a similar structure, so perhaps we can model this recursively. Wait, but I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient. I computed each layer step by step, which gave me the correct result. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. Just to make sure, I'll recount the layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's nine layers, each computed correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check the number of layers again because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which is the outermost one. So, yes, it's nine layers, so L_9.\n\nTherefore, everything still holds.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to represent this as a geometric series, perhaps I can find another way. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L_1=4, L_2=13, L_3=40, etc., as before.\n\nBut since we've already solved it with the recurrence relation, and confirmed with the closed-form, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, just to recap:\n\n1. Compute innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524.\n4. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step, multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Wait a second, I just noticed something. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula for a_n without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, solve for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me check my computations once more. Maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula is consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, especially since there are only nine layers. Let me just write them all out again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. All these steps check out. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and verified each computation to ensure accuracy. It's a bit of a lengthy process, but by breaking it down and checking each layer, I can be confident in the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence to find a formula, but maybe that's overcomplicating for this problem since it's only 9 layers deep. But just for fun, let me see: Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify a few more layers using the formula. For example, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula to the ninth layer gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, so any error in an earlier layer would propagate. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524=88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, computing up to a_9, and then multiplying by 3. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's another way to compute it without manually calculating each layer. That's pretty cool. It shows that recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence can save a lot of time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each calculation. 3. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the innermost term directly. 4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. Both methods led to the same result, which is reassuring. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3^{10} to ensure it's 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Perfect. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I guess another way to look at this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expression can be seen as a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so it's more of a recursive multiplication rather than a straightforward sum. But the recurrence approach worked well, and I was able to derive a formula for the nth term. So, using that, I can compute any layer quickly without having to compute each step manually, which is helpful. I wonder if there's a way to represent this entire expression as a single formula without computing each layer. Given that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, it's essentially 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as we computed. But since we have a formula for a_n, we can plug in n=9 and multiply by 3. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to write the final answer: (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. That's pretty neat. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allows you to express the entire computation in a compact formula. I think this problem was a good exercise in recognizing recursive patterns and applying recurrence relations to find a solution efficiently. It also shows the power of mathematical formulas in simplifying what initially seems like a complex and tedious computation.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern and using a formula derived from a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a repeated structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, I can model this recursion. The general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see. The expression inside is 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )). So, each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if I have n layers, the total would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we saw earlier. Since there are 9 layers inside the first 3*(...), that would be n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then multiply by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues for nine layers, resulting in the value 29,524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the time constraints, maybe the step-by-step approach is better. Alternatively, I can try to find a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see if there's a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_n, where n=9. So, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is more efficient.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. We can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in computing the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step is manageable. Alternatively, I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's a cleaner way to write it. So a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me think about this. Let's consider a general case where we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, but that's a bit different because here each layer is dependent on the next. Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I have n layers, the value would be something like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with n layers. In our problem, n=9. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think recursively. Let\u2019s denote L(k) as the value of the expression with k layers. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L(9). So, each L(k) = 1 + 3*L(k-1). This is a recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L(k). Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L(k). The recurrence is L(k) = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_h(k) = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(k) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(k) = L_h(k) + L_p(k) = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(k) = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L(k) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That was a good exercise because it confirmed that my step-by-step computation was correct. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048. 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after going through both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula approach, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've thought this through thoroughly and checked my work multiple times, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. By defining each layer recursively and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: As above, 88572. So, seems like all the steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and solve for them. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, for the homogeneous solution, but perhaps another approach is better. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation by iteration. Let me try expanding the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, I see that each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the general solution can be found by solving the recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also worked fine. But having a formula is nice because it can save time, especially if the number of layers were much larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me just go through the layers again quickly to double-check. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, everything checks out. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result obtained by manual computation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, then we can write a recurrence relation: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_{n+1} = k*a_n + c is a_n = k^n*a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, k = 3, c = 1. Wait, but let me check the exact form. The recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 each time you go out a layer. So, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of 3^k terms. But I think the recurrence relation method is more straightforward here. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the result 88572. I also verified it using a formula for the recurrence relation, which gave the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step, just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think I did that correctly. Hmm, but let me just check one more time, perhaps with a different method. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something? Wait, because each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are all integers, and B is -1/2. That seems a bit odd, but maybe it's correct. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9. But since I already computed a_9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms it.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence that can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is building a number in base 3. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here, but it's an interesting thought. Each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to digits in base 3, where each digit is multiplied by a power of 3. But since each digit here is 1, except perhaps the last one, which is 3, it might not directly translate, but it's an interesting observation. However, since the previous methods have worked, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. To recap, the steps were: 1. Identify the nested structure and realize that working from the innermost parentheses outward is the way to go. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) and moving outward, each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. 3. After computing the innermost 9 layers, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. As a check, model the problem using a recurrence relation and solve it to confirm the result. 5. Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of base 3 digits, though that approach didn't directly yield a solution here. Both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method led to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the multiplication step: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check one or two layers again to be sure. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1} + c/(1 - r), provided that r \u2260 1. In this case, c = 1, r = 3, and a_1 = 4. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n - 1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute that: First, 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Then, 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_n = (9/2)*(3)^{n - 1} + (-1/2). Simplifying, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n - 1} - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9*3^{2} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (9*3^{3} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561 = let's compute that: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 9*3^8 = 59049. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the entire expression, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a linear recurrence. But I think the step-by-step computation I did earlier is solid, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\) where \\(n\\) is the layer number.

Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Alternatively, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined in terms of the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, starting with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., as I did before. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p +1. Solving for a_p: a_p -3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, and going up to a_9. Wait, actually, let me make sure: the innermost is 1 +3, which is a_1=4. Then, each layer wraps around, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did earlier, and arrived at the same answer. It's good that both methods agree. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern, each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps can be modeled using recursion. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can compute the final answer directly without going through each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods worked. So, just to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus three times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I found that each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Then, since the entire expression is 3 times L_9, I computed that as 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, I can compute it as (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. Either way, the result is the same. I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the pattern and use a recurrence relation. Each layer can be expressed as $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the outermost layer (n=9), we calculate $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
