    "text": " 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems right. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Maybe each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about it, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a closed-form formula for the nth layer, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, yes, each layer checks out. Then, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. If there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or a geometric series approach would be more efficient, but in this case, step-by-step computation works.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression multiplied by some factor. But in this case, since the recurrence is linear, the closed-form solution is more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a step-by-step approach, we compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives the closed-form solution, which confirms the result obtained through manual computation. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me confirm the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each time, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's nine layers. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1 + 3(...). Inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the initial 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), so that's one. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's two. Continuing, I can see that there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), which means nine layers. So, my earlier calculation of nine layers is correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me just check my multiplication again because sometimes even if the layers are correct, a simple multiplication error can throw everything off. So, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me verify that: 30000 - 476 = 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - 1428. 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Correct. So, that checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another condition to find A and B. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Now, plug n=2 into the general solution: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have a system of equations:\n\n3A + B = 4\n\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, using the formula for the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods gave me the same answer, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. The key was recognizing the pattern and finding a formula for each layer, which saved me from computing each step manually beyond a certain point. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also works, but it's more time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, using the recurrence relation approach was more efficient. I should make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing 3^10. Let me verify that: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 is indeed (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct, Layer 4. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, Layer 5. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, Layer 6. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, Layer 7. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, Layer 8. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, Layer 9. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9, where a_9=29524. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a formula to confirm, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1, so a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. As before. Now, let's try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me consider that. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). Each time, it's a + b*(previous term). So, if we let x_n = a + b*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = a + b. Then, each term builds on the previous one. In our case, a=1, b=3. So, x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. x_2 = 1 + 3*x_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. x_3 = 1 + 3*x_2 = 40, etc. So, in general, each term x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is x_n = (b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + a*(b^{n-1} - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since each step is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, we can solve it as a geometric progression. Let me see. The homogeneous solution is x_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say x_p. Then, x_p = 1 + 3x_p => x_p - 3x_p = 1 => -2x_p = 1 => x_p = -1/2. So the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost, n=9: x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I can confidently say the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+\" before each 3. Let's write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+\" occurs. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n. The particular solution, assuming a constant solution, is a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). So, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + d/(1 - c). Applying the initial condition a_0 = a_0, so a_0 = A + d/(1 - c). Then, A = a_0 - d/(1 - c). So, a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Alternatively, it can be written as a_n = a_0*c^n + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me verify with our specific case. Here, c = 3, d = 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, using the formula, a_n = a_0*3^n + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = a_0*3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Now, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Wait, but in the formula, a_n is defined for n \u2265 0. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, let's consider that our first term is a_1 = 4, so let's set n=1. Then, a_1 = 4 = a_0*3^1 + (3^1 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3*a_0 + 1 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1*3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have a_9, because we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire computation as a formula, it would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me check: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for L_n and then multiplied by 3. Let me see: Since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3^10 and 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59049, so L_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Everything checks out.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it's consistent. For example, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. So, yes, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time I go in, it's another layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. From the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So that's correct, 9 layers, which I labeled from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my calculations seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers I computed. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.

Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's substitute L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B into the equation: L_n = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate this to the general solution L_n = A*3^n + B: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster if I recognize the pattern. But since I didn't see it at first, I had to compute each layer step by step. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next expression:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc., as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} -1 =59048. Then, 3*59048 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144 /2 =88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Let's compute 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a pattern. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute the nth term without having to compute each previous term. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Let's compute 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I go out a layer, I add another 3(...). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Let me verify each layer again just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me recheck a few layers. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. So, the layers all check out. Then, the final multiplication by 3: 29524 * 3. As I did before, 29524 * 3 = 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but since it's nested, maybe it's a bit different. Let me see. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, if I let x = 1 + 3x, but that seems recursive. Wait, but in this case, each layer is only being added once, so it's more like a linear nesting rather than a recursive formula. Alternatively, I can represent this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. This is a linear recurrence, and maybe I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Wait, but let me check that formula. The standard solution for a linear recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a), provided that a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, which is not equal to 1, so the formula applies. Here, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see: Let's define L_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, but that might not be accurate because L_1 is the first layer. Alternatively, perhaps I should index starting from n=0. Let me try that. Let me define L_0 = 1, since the innermost term is 1 + 3, but actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is L_1 = 4. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I had before. So, using the formula for the linear recurrence: L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Here, a = 3, b = 1, L_0 = 1. So, L_n = (1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3). Let's compute that: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, L_n = (1 - (-1/2)) * 3^n + (-1/2) = (1 + 1/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step and even used a different method to verify the result. It seems solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this expression is quite nested. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer increases n by 1. Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression for a_n. That's pretty cool because it saves time from computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. However, it's good to know the recurrence approach for future problems that might have more layers or different structures. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, I arrive at the same final result: 88572.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads me to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is building a number that is one more than three times the previous layer. So, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, and so on, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiply the last term by 3 to get 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recursive formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. So yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) How many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, from the expression, starting after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 is the innermost expression, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the pattern. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3^1\nWait, 3^2 = 9, 9 + 4 = 13, which is 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13? Wait, 3^0 is 1, 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9. So 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Let's see: 3^3 = 27, 3^2 = 9, 3^1 = 3, 3^0 = 1. Sum from 0 to 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Yes! So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check. For a_1: n=1, (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For a_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For a_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can check the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. Let me count how many 1+3 terms there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 terms inside each other. Each time, the expression is 1+3(...) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3 around it. Let me count how many times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, the final value is 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but given the number of layers, it's plausible. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the general term. First, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. So, by both iteratively computing each layer and by using the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same answer. It's reassuring that both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by iteratively computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, the general term is found to be \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, this results in \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.

Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n can be calculated. But since we're dealing with a fixed number of layers, maybe it's easier to compute each step manually as I did before. Alternatively, I could look for a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's plug in n=2: a_2=13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer again: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me write down the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern where each term is multiplied by 3 and increased by 1, leading to a geometric progression. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers (nine), using the recurrence or computing step by step was manageable. However, having a general formula is useful, especially if the number of layers were larger or variable. In conclusion, after carefully computing each layer or using the recurrence relation, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

But let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say that each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's correct, as we had before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. Perfect, the formula works.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 - 1 = 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which would allow us to compute the nth layer without computing each previous one. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, we could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression, which is why the formula works. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the 9th layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.

Each layer is computed correctly, and each step follows logically. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step makes it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
