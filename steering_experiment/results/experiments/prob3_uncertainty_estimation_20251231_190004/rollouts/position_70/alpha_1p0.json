    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But let me check a couple of the layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3, as I did before, is 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. First, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substitute a_{n} = C*3^n + D: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both computing each layer step by step and also derived a formula to verify the result. It's always good to check using different methods to make sure the answer is correct, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the computation. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be slightly different. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check that. Let me consider L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^{n}, and the particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So the general solution is L_n = C*a^{n} + b/(1 - a). Applying initial condition L_0. Wait, in our case, L_1 = 4. So, if n=1, L_1 = 4. Let me see. Let me adjust the formula to fit our case. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, a = 3, b = 1. Then, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition. Wait, what is the initial condition? When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, I'll do a quick check with another method. Let me compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each layer's value as I go. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The pattern is consistent, the formula for the recurrence checks out, and both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach, even though it's time-consuming. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: We have L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. Let's try to find A and B. For n=1: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840 + 0 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 88572. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the result. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That sounds like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let\u2019s assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => 2C = -1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked my work thoroughly, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula for the layers. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which made the computation much faster, especially for higher layers. Without the formula, computing each layer up to nine would have been time-consuming, but with it, I can compute L_9 directly and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing recurrence relations and applying them to simplify the computation. It also reinforced the importance of checking work through multiple methods to ensure accuracy. I feel more comfortable now with handling nested expressions and seeing them as sequences that can be modeled with mathematical formulas. It's a valuable skill for tackling more complex problems in the future.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer.

Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, yes, after computing the inner expression as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which might help in computing the value without having to compute each layer manually. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. This is a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is L_1, and the outermost layer is L_9. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, each layer is built by starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, if we have 9 layers, that would mean the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with our earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute L_9 directly as (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29,524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplications. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Correct. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 29,524 * 3: As we did earlier, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, using another approach, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's another way to compute it, and it also gives 88,572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But wait, let me check my computations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I feel like this is a very large number, so maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear recursions. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1)= (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is L(9)=29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L(9)=3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula and see if it matches. For example, Layer 5: L(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's a geometric series? Wait, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, we could have computed it using the formula without expanding each layer. That might have saved time, especially if the expression were longer. But since there are only nine layers, manually computing each step wasn't too bad. Just to be thorough, let me check one more layer using the formula. Let's take n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier result. Similarly, n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a recurrence relation. Let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see: Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer. That was a good exercise because it not only helped me compute the answer step by step but also showed me how to approach similar nested expressions in the future by finding a pattern or recurrence relation and solving it with a formula. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that using the same method.\n\nInnermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNow, the expression is 3*(Layer 3) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using this relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524, as computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nThen, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and even used a different method to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Calculating each layer step by step leads to the final result, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, but let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's go through each layer step by step again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which is 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without expanding each layer, but since it's only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. However, if the number of layers were larger, a formula might be more efficient. Let me think if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both methods, expanding step by step and using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation. Let's go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think if I can model this with a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say L(n) represents the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, actually, let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, using the formula, Layer 9 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me check the formula with the earlier layers. For Layer 1: n=1, L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, so all the layers compute correctly, and the final multiplication is correct. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's compute a_4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is what I had before. Correct. So, all the steps are consistent. Therefore, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me double-check each layer to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting over, perhaps. Let's compute each layer step by step again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, eventually leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Right.)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Right.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Yes, that's correct.)\n\nSo, each layer seems to compute correctly. Then, multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but I just want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error in any step. Let me verify a couple of the layers again.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me check: the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost operation is 3 times a_9, which we computed as 29524, giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't spot any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer's value. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, the first inner expression is 1 + 3(...). Each time I go in, I see a new layer. Let me count how many times I have \"1 + 3(...)\" nested inside each other. Starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1. (1 + 3(...) 2. (1 + 3(...) 3. (1 + 3(...) 4. (1 + 3(...) 5. (1 + 3(...) 6. (1 + 3(...) 7. (1 + 3(...) 8. (1 + 3(...) 9. (1 + 3(...)) So, actually, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, my earlier calculation was correct, with 9 layers, leading to the innermost being Layer 1, up to Layer 9 being the one before the final multiplication by 3. So, each layer computation was correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have a smaller version with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, multiply by 3: 3*13=39. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13=39. Correct. Now, let's try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost: 1 + 3=4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Let me compute it step by step: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. Correct. So, the pattern works for smaller numbers, which gives me more confidence that my method is correct.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier. This recurrence relation can be written as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! So the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 correctly gives each layer's value. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I'm done here. The problem was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then finding a general formula helped confirm the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can directly compute a_9 without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way, even though it's a bit time-consuming.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's check at n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula would be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, if we can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time, especially if there are more layers. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if we use the formula, since the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute it without going through each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), to find a constant c that makes it a homogeneous recurrence. Let's set up the equation: a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Expanding the right side: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. So, the equation becomes: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the original recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplify: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. So, the transformed sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. That's a simple geometric progression with ratio 3. Therefore, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. What's b_1? b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n-1}) = (3^{n+1}) / 2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation formula also gives me the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f. It works! So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_1*(r^{n-1}) - but wait, actually, let me think again. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572.

Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Started from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.

Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute this expression in a different way, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer. Because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, confirming the result through both iterative computation and a closed-form solution.

Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find the value of the innermost layer and multiply by 3 successively. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my computations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually computing each layer, just to verify. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for a_n? Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check my steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). If I expand this, it's 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ... )). Wait, actually, each term is 1 multiplied by 3, and then added to the next term. Let me try to write it out step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, E = 3*(1 + 3*A), where A is the inner expression: A = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) But wait, A is similar to E but with one fewer layer. Wait, actually, each time we have a similar structure. So, perhaps E can be expressed recursively. Let me see, E = 3*(1 + 3*A), where A = 3*(1 + 3*B), and so on, until we reach the innermost term. But I think the earlier approach with the layers is more straightforward. Alternatively, using the formula I derived: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then E = 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. If I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))). Each time, the number of 3s increases by one. Let's try expanding E step by step: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand the innermost part first: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be 88572. I think I'm confident enough that this is the correct answer. To recap, I broke down the expression into layers, computed each layer step by step, verified the pattern with a formula, and then confirmed the final result by expanding the expression. Each method led me to the same conclusion, so I don't think I made a mistake here. It's a bit tedious, but since the pattern repeats itself, it's manageable. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).

Yeah, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a bit. I computed Layer 9 as 29524, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) ... Up to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, the first \"1+\" is at Layer 1: 1+3. Then, each time we go out, we have another \"1+\", so Layer 2, Layer 3, etc., up to Layer 9. So yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my computation of Layer 9 as 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding those together: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, +1000 = 59000, +40 = 59040, +8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. So adding those: 70000 + 18000 = 88000, +1000 = 89000, +60 = 89060, +12 = 89072. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Hmm, so perhaps my initial multiplication was wrong. Let me try again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So that's 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 89072. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition method. Let's try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\n- 29524 + 20000 = 49524\n- 49524 + 9000 = 58524\n- 58524 + 500 = 59024\n- 59024 + 20 = 59044\n- 59044 + 4 = 59048\n\nThen, 59048 + 29524:\n\n- 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n- 79048 + 9000 = 88048\n- 88048 + 500 = 88548\n- 88548 + 20 = 88568\n- 88568 + 4 = 88572\n\nAh, okay, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier addition. So the correct total is indeed 88572. That matches the multiplication result. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct.

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 would be 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which can be solved as a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*(r^{n}), but in this case, a_0 would be 1? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be based on the characteristic equation, but maybe it's easier to expand the terms. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*1) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nWait, I'm noticing that each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Let's check: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\nYes, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, for a_1, it's 1 + 3, which is sum from k=0 to 1: 1 + 3^1 = 4. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that formula. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, a_4=121.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, the expression is 3 times the Layer 9 expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, yes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since the outermost layer is 3*a_9, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut since I already did the step-by-step computation and verified it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost one, which we computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step built upon the previous one correctly, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (As computed above). So, I think that's correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D first. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be represented as 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but actually, each time you go out a layer, you're adding another term. Let me try to see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 3, then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous. So, perhaps the total expression is a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, multiplied by something. Wait, let's see: Let me consider that each time we go out a layer, we're adding another 3^n term. So, starting from the innermost: 3, then 3*(3) = 9, then 3*(3 + 9) = 3*12 = 36, but that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since we've already found that the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Which is the same result as before. Therefore, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier computations of each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can apply instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for such a sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a geometric sequence: a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we compute each layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nWe use the formula for the general solution of the recurrence relation \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) to verify:\n\n- For \\( n = 9 \\): \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
