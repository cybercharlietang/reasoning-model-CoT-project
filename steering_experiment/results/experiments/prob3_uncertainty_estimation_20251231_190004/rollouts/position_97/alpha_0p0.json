The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since n is small (n=9), computing each term is straightforward. The recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.

To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and find a particular solution. Let's substitute n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, to find the particular solution, we can assume a steady state where a_n = C for all n. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.

So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.

Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n is given by that formula. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, where a_9 is the innermost expression? Wait, no, actually, the innermost expression is a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, let me clarify: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, which is the value before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, the value we're computing is 3*a_9. So, using the closed-form solution, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the final value is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier computation. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, which is especially useful if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. It's good to verify the answer using two different methods to ensure that it's correct. So, the first method was computing each layer step by step, and the second method was using the closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation.

Simplify: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). So this is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. The initial term is a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Alternatively, since 9 is 3^2, so 9*3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches the earlier result. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form expression, which confirms the result when computed step by step. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Now, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to use a formula instead of computing each layer manually, although in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think the key takeaway here is that when faced with a nested expression like this, it's helpful to look for patterns or recurrence relations that can simplify the computation, especially if the number of layers is large. But for this problem, either method works. Either way, the answer is 88572. I feel confident about this now. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, as both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence formula gave me the same result.

Let's substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches Layer 2.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.

For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without calculating each layer, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify. I think I've got it now. The key was to recognize the recurrence relation and then either compute each term step by step or find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

    "text": " Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, let's check if that applies here. Our equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k = 3, c = 1. The solution would be a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). But wait, since k > 1, the denominator (1 - k) is negative, which might complicate things, but let's proceed. So, a_1 = 4. Plugging in: a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify the fractions: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2))*(3)^{n-1} + (-1/2). That is, a_n = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*(3)^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*(3)^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*(3)^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*(3)^8 - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So total is 54000 + 4500 = 58500 + 540 = 59040 + 9 = 59049. Then, (9/2)*6561 = 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.
