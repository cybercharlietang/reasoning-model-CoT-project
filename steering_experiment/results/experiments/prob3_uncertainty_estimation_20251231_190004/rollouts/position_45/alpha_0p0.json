    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 0*3=0 +1=1. So putting it all together, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 30000*3=90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in calculation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers increases. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result. 3. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the result by 3. 4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations to find a general expression and then compute the 9th layer directly. 5. Confirm that both methods yield the same result, ensuring accuracy. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry over 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2, write 8. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step, leading to an incorrect final result. Let me recompute each layer just to be sure. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think I did it right both times. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make it easier. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we're starting from 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. This seems like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers from the innermost to the outermost), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we have to multiply by 3, as the entire expression is 3*(...). So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but it's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step, but by using both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I can be sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+... The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of 1+3( sections. The first is 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have 1+3(... So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, each layer from 1 to 9. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be the final answer. But let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3. 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000; 9000 \u00d73=27000; 500\u00d73=1500; 20\u00d73=60; 4\u00d73=12. Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 by breaking it down differently: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (29500 + 24) \u00d73 = 29500\u00d73 +24\u00d73 = 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, all the steps seem correct, and I didn't make any errors in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by substituting the previous result into the expression. Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3 * 29,524 step by step. 3 * 20,000 = 60,000 3 * 9,000 = 27,000 3 * 500 = 1,500 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series. Let me recall that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). In this case, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which is similar to a recursive relation. Maybe I can model this recursion. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, the recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, in this case, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for the recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\), leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Ultimately, the entire expression simplifies to \\(88,572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again, just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is homogeneous, the particular solution is a constant, so we can find B. Let me set n approaching infinity, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's solve for A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let me write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution L_p(n) = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. I didn't make any mistakes in my computations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, if the inner expression evaluates to 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, because doing it nine times is a bit tedious and error-prone.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of Layer n. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's assume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the inner expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243, 243*3=729, 729*3=2187, 2187*3=6561, 6561*3=19683, 19683*3=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula gives me confidence that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n- Each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost.\n- Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allows using a formula to find the value directly.\n- Both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.\n- Multiplying the final inner value by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems messy. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. But that might take too long. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27+1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6+2=8. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27+1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6+2=8. 0*3=0. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me write it down properly:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x    3\n  -------\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 30000 * 3 = 90000\n\nSubtract (30000 - 29524) = 476\n\nSo, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the innermost parentheses is 4, then each subsequent layer is computed by 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step checks out, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to this kind of recurrence is given by L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(a - 1).\n\nLet me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me think about that.\n\nStarting from L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait a minute, this seems like each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nIndeed, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^{n}.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, yes, each layer L_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, multiple approaches confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is similar to a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one, it's more like a recurrence relation. The recurrence here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, for a larger number of layers, it would be more efficient to find a formula. Let me think about that for a moment. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I'm pretty sure that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is defined as 1 plus three times the next inner term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost term is 4.

    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is approximately 29,500, and 29,500 * 3 is 88,500. So, 88,572 would be correct. But let me double-check my multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So yes, 88,572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back a step. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me check each layer again because if I made a mistake in one layer, it will propagate through all the subsequent layers. Let's start from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, if I can find a formula for Ln in terms of n, that would save time. Let me see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is being multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, since it's finite, with 9 layers, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, recursively, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I got before. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} and see if that helps. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I think that's it.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression, and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But since the coefficients are changing, the recurrence approach seems more appropriate here. Another way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(something), which can be rewritten as 3*(something) + 1, which is similar to 3*(previous term) + 1. So, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, starting from 4. So, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3 and a constant addition of 1 each time. Using the formula for such a recurrence is helpful because it allows us to find a closed-form expression without computing each layer manually. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula for future reference. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the nth layer. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me substitute n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's find A and B. But wait, since each L_n depends only on the previous term, and the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed layer by layer. So, that checks out. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I messed up the carry-over. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry0\nBut wait, there's no digit beyond the ten thousands place, so the next digit is 0, but since it's the end, we just add the carry. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 29,524, which is 2*10,000 + 9*1,000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4*1. So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens place is7, carryover0\n5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds place is5, carryover1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands place is8, carryover2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands place is8, carryover0\nSo the result is 88,572. So 29,524 *3=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm this by another method. Maybe I can compute each layer more carefully to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again, compute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a recursive-like structure where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each time, the value grows by a factor of 3 plus 1. So, computing each layer step by step ensures that I don't make a mistake. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, just to cross-verify.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21924 =3C -1/2 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at 88,572. That confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I still get 88,572. That confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Proceed outward, computing each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3.

Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Let's write it out vertically:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x    3\n  --------\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, but we've already processed all digits except the leading 9? Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So when we get to the next digit after 2, it's 9, but we've already processed that. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15.

Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But Layer 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layer computations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, the problem is written as 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are nine such layers. So, my computation seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, if there were many more layers, a formula would be more efficient.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, my step-by-step computation should be accurate.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to ensure I didn't make a calculation error in any layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which we've computed as 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, yes, nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the general formula.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, we can confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the general formula for the recurrence relation to verify the result. It seems consistent in both approaches.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Wait, hold on, I think I went too far. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication with another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that again because each layer was built by 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), and I computed each layer correctly. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since this could get tedious for more layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (L_1 - d)/(a - 1) * a^{n} + d, where d is the particular solution.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by recognizing that each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is similar to a geometric series or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have a formula for L_n, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*L_9, where L_9 is as we found.\n\nBut since we already computed it, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nGiven that each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nEach layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that Layer \\(n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor Layer 9:\n\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's write it out:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 only has five digits, so after the 2, we have 9, but that's already been accounted for. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer. But let me confirm that the original expression is indeed 3*(Layer 9), not 3*(Layer 9 + ...). Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, it's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). The innermost part is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, the outermost layer is 3 times (Layer 9). Therefore, my calculation seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nGiven that each layer is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, to compute L_9, I can either compute each step manually, which I did, or find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L_9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression step by step, but that might be time-consuming.

    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's like a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from the innermost term, which is 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote a_n as the nth layer, then a_1=4, a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 =4\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, as computed before, a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p =3*a_p +1\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Wait, let me check that again because when I multiply 29524 by 3, I think it's 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers earlier. Let me go back through each layer to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, when I compute 3*(Layer 9), is that correct? Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. The general form of such a recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I could have used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed a_9 directly and then multiplied by 3. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I've got it right. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute that: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Okay, that's consistent. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long chain. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, which could have saved time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. So, maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if n were larger. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the total expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to verify: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've solved it correctly. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step helped prevent mistakes. Also, recognizing the pattern and deriving the formula was a good check on the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula.

Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one step which propagates outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That's much more efficient, especially if there were more layers.

    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save me time instead of computing each term step by step. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer. That's pretty cool. It shows how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem-solving process. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing a couple more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches what I computed earlier. Layer 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct again. So, the formula holds, and therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's always good to verify using two different methods to ensure that I didn't make a mistake. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.
