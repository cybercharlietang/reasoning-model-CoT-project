Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation, where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term to avoid computing each layer manually. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and use it to compute the next layer, continuing until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check the formula again. The closed-form solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nYes, the formula works, so using it for n=9 gives a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 at the ninth layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term).

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would make it easier to compute for n=9.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\nFinally, the last digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should result in 88572, which is 6 digits. Let me add commas for clarity: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that makes sense because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be slightly less, which is 88,572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think my final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to miscalculate when doing this step by step. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Now, the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me apply that here. Here, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, the closed-form would be a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) )= (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n})*(9/2)*(1/3) = (3^{n})*(3/2) )= (3^{n+1})/2.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 3^{n-1} is 3^{n}/3, so (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (9/2)*(3^{n})/3 = (3^{n})*(9/2)*(1/3) = (3^{n})*(3/2) )= (3^{n+1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, so having a formula is helpful.\n\nSo, in summary, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost one. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since each layer n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After evaluating all nine layers, the outermost expression is found to be 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because when I did 3*29524, I think I might have messed up the digit positions. Let me try again more carefully. 29524 multiplied by 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.

Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after 2*3, that's the last digit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the carryover. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit from right to left:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct now. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify this because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, maybe my initial calculation was correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in this case, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), so a=3 and b=1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can use the formula to express the entire expression directly. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^10) = 3^11, and 3*1=3.\n\nSo, the expression is (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, the nth layer can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Instead, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, actually, that's not accurate. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me check: 20000 + 9000 = 29000, then +500 = 29500, +20 = 29520, +4 = 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

But wait, let me double-check my computations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's model it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, then a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, and so on up to a_9. So, we have a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The standard solution for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I think that's about it. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped verify that my step-by-step computation was accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:  \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n- Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n- Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n- Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n- Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n- Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n- Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n- Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n- Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's nested, it's a bit more involved. However, using the recurrence relation approach worked well, and I verified it with the formula, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   - Final Expression: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 Correct. So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation, where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the problem is asking for 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the final answer is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method confirms the previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer is calculated correctly as above. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, since we have nine layers. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute this without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations for any arithmetic errors. Starting with a_9: 3^{10} is indeed 59049 because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29,524 * 3. Multiply 29,524 by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me write it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nThen, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 is written down as 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. Wait, 29,524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That matches our previous calculation. So, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in the calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let's see.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which in this case is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed step by step until the outermost layer is reached. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. Applying this for n=9 gives the value 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me verify that because 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.

So, putting it together: 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, going back through the layers, each time I computed the innermost first and worked my way out, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1. It looks like each layer's value is growing quite rapidly, which makes sense because each time we're tripling the previous layer and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with an added constant each time. Let me just double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it generally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, it works for the first few layers. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. That's reassuring. It shows that the method is correct and that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and it's repeated n times, maybe there's a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, that matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3^10 directly. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. So, yes, 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. That seems solid.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that checks out. So, the final answer should be 88572.

That seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. It's a recursive pattern, essentially. So, the key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer step by step. Once I got to the outermost layer, I just had to multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be sure, I can check a couple of the layers again. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3 = 88572. Yep, I think that's solid.

Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

So, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully.

So, reading from top: 6, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again: Each time, the layers are 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me see. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I still get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me model it as a recurrence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts at 1 for the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the known values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) seems like it's a geometric series or something, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B.\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3*B + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, since each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4, then the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify with a smaller case to see if the formula holds.\n\nFor example, take n=2:\n\nL_1=4, L_2=1 +3*4=13.\n\nUsing the formula, L_2=(3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: L_3=1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems solid.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer.

Hmm, so each layer seems to be correct. Let me try computing it another way to confirm. Maybe using a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula. Wait, this expression seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. That's a recursive formula. So, starting with a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could have computed it using the closed-form formula without computing each layer. Let me try that.\n\nSince a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049, 3^{11}=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Therefore, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad, although it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. I think I was careful enough to check each step, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. Compute each layer up to the 9th layer, which gives 29,524.\n4. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we find that the expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2, which also equals 88,572.

Wait, that's getting confusing. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,8,5,7,8,7,8,8? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572 Yes, that seems correct. I think I did it right. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, the pattern is each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, the numbers grow quickly, which makes sense why the final result is so large. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, I'll recheck a couple of layers. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)=1 + 3*4=1+12=13 Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Multiplying by 3:29524*3=88572 Correct. So, I think I've got it right.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the final result.\n\nLet me recast the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\n=> K - 3K = 1\n\n=> -2K = 1\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula would be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just cross-verify with another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each time you go out a layer, it's like doing 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nThe formula for such a recurrence is indeed a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 when starting from a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps the formula is slightly different.\n\nBut regardless, since we've already computed each layer step by step and confirmed with the formula that a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of them. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me consider whether it can be expressed as a sum of a geometric sequence. Let me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, so each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using standard techniques. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a1 = 4. Plugging n=1: a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a9), where a9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, starting from 1, each time you add 1 and multiply by 3. So, this is a geometric series perhaps? Wait, let me see. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, so this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it a bit. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Wait, but that's similar to E = 3*(1 + 3*(E/3)), because each layer is similar to E but scaled down. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself. Let me see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). Let me look inside the innermost part. Suppose after a certain number of layers, it's similar to E divided by some power of 3. Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, since I already have a formula for L_n, and L_9 is 29524, then E = 3*L_9 = 88572. So, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Multiply by 3: 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is computed. \n\nUsing a recurrence relation approach, we determine that each layer can be expressed as $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
