    "text": " Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nLooking for a pattern, perhaps each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this.\n\nFor a_1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Each layer \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

But let me make sure that I correctly accounted for all the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, another 3(1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside all the layers.\n- Then, inside, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was after 9 layers, right? So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the layers again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then a particular solution is added.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a root r=3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire computation using the formula without computing each layer. Since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSimplifying that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3^{11} is 177147, so:\n\n(177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of error.\n\nSo, to summarize, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the recurrence a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, starting from a_1=4. The general formula for the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that gives (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back to each layer and compute them again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, to compute this without expanding each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the final expression is 3*L9.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive structure can be represented as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, each subsequent L_n is 1 + 3 times the previous L.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*b^{n} + c, where c is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrence relations. The solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Alternatively, since it's a first-order linear recurrence, the solution can be expressed as L_n = C*b^n + d, where d is the particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nLet me try to compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Now, if I look at the values, they seem to follow a pattern similar to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nWait, I recognize these numbers. They look like they might be related to the powers of 3, but adjusted by some factor. Let me check.\n\nCompute 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, but our L_n terms are 4,13,40,121, etc., which are higher than these. Alternatively, perhaps each L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, L1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, L2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, L3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, L4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, L5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, L6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, L7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, L8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, L9=29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute L_n directly without expanding each layer. That's much faster, especially for larger n.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify the formula for L_n.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nAssume L_{n-1} = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nThen, L_n = 1 + 3*(3^{n} -1)/2 = 1 + (3^{n+1} -3)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2)/2 + (3^{n+1} -3)/2\n\n= (2 + 3^{n+1} -3)/2\n\n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich is the formula we wanted. So, it holds by induction. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have continued computing each layer step by step, but recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula makes it much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern where L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Applying this formula, we find the ninth layer, multiply by 3, and arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (next layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we compute each layer and find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (next layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognize that each layer \\(L_n\\) follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Okay, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that applies here. Let me think about it. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to represent it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered each step, checked my computations, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 (correct) Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct) Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct) Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct) Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct) Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct) Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct) Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct) Then 3*29524=88572 (correct) Okay, that seems consistent. So, each step checks out, and the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

So then, 3\u00d729524=88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u21d2 K -3K=1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4=3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression in terms of 3^10.\n\nSince each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a specific formula. The final computation results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Each layer is computed correctly by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P \u2192 P - 3P = 1 \u2192 -2P = 1 \u2192 P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that's the same as we computed earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, after computing each layer from the inside out, we get the final result as 88572. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, let me check that again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524.\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication once more because it's easy to make a mistake with larger numbers.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. But I want to make sure that the original expression is correctly handled. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which ends up being 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time. But since I was just starting out, it was helpful to compute each layer to see the pattern.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building up a number where each digit is 1, but multiplied by powers of 3. But I think the recurrence relation approach is the most straightforward here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer step by step up to the ninth layer.\n4. Multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution and compute directly.\n\nEither way, the result is the same: 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step helped me avoid mistakes. Also, verifying with the recurrence relation method gave me the same result, which adds to my confidence.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me do that step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 5, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, there's a (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the expression has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. To find a closed-form solution, we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which is always reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can use another approach to verify. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a recurrence relation, solved it, and confirmed that the formula gives the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, confirming each step. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: as computed earlier, 88572.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm starting to think that maybe the way I broke it down is correct, but let me check another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did before. So, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step without layers, just expanding each parenthesis as I go. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next is (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that each layer follows a geometric progression. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try solving it that way.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWow, that's another way to get the same answer. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That makes me even more confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But since each term depends on the previous one, it's a linear recurrence, and solving it as such gives a neat formula.\n\nIn any case, both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation\u2014lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can be certain that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a finite nested expression with nine layers. If it were infinite, it would converge to a certain value, but since it's finite, we can compute it step by step as I did. Alternatively, maybe I can express it recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 =13 f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +39=40 And so on. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for f(n). The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) +1, with f(1)=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) =3*f(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n)= C*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3C -1/2 =>3C=4 +1/2=9/2 =>C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result.

So, putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me check the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a_n = C is a constant solution. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to 3^n -1 over 2, but in this case, it's nested nine times, so it's 3^10 -1 over 2, then multiplied by 3. Wait, let me clarify. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after n layers, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, after 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer and applying the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 7 5 2 4. Wait, that would be 87524? Wait, no, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87524? Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Alternatively, 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n--------\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n29524 + 29524:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carryover 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1 = 19, write 9, carryover 1\n2 + 2 = 4 +1 =5\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n59048\n+29524\n--------\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n0 +5=5\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover1\n5 +2=7 +1=8\nSo, 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from 87524. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication.\n\nLet me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d73=12, write 2, carryover1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n5\u00d73=15, write5, carryover1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572 as well. So, earlier, when I thought I got 87524, I must have miscalculated. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. Starting from the inside: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a \"1+3(\", which is 8 times, because after the first 3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" instances. Wait, but when I was computing, I had 9 layers, from 1 to 9. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me see. Each time you have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, in the original expression, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting with 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is the second layer, and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Let's write them out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, starting from the outermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so in total, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are 8 more \"1+3(\", each of which adds a new layer. So, total layers would be 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, starting from the first one after the initial 3, up to the innermost. So, that would be 9 layers in total, which matches the layers I computed earlier. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, ending up with 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's add those: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern in the layers. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, 3*L(n) = 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2 = (3^(n+2) -3)/2. For n=9, 3*L(9) = (3^11 -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is defined as $L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1)$, starting from $L(1) = 4$.

Let me count: Starting from the innermost, there are nine 1+3s, each nested inside the previous. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that each layer was computed correctly.

Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing so quickly.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841=29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both by computing step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAt n=2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAt n=3, L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could also recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series. Let me think about that approach.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). It's a nested structure, which can be represented as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to use the recurrence relation approach, which I've already done.\n\nIn any case, I think I've thoroughly checked the steps and even found a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\). Using this recurrence, we compute up to the ninth layer, which equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nYes, so it's 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount because the problem has nine layers, but I only went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but when I started, Layer 1 was 4, and each subsequent layer was built on that. So, perhaps I miscalculated the layers. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3. Let me compute this more carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nFirst digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nSecond digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nThird digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nFourth digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nFifth digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this multiplication again because 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add them:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly because the original expression has nine layers, but when I started, Layer 1 was the innermost, so Layer 9 is the outermost, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer wraps around it with another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recalculate each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Now, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 29524 seems like a large number, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence relation approach. It's easy to make an error in setting up the equations.\n\nGiven the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe found the solution as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches Layer 2.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding all the terms, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, I can compute the expression step by step as I did earlier, which seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut since it's nested, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the expression step by step again, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 +2 =8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's check Layer 5 and beyond:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280:\n\n3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Wait, that's Layer 8. Wait, no, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*Layer6, which is 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. So Layer7=9841. Then Layer8 is 1 + 3*Layer7=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Then Layer9 is 1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573? Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So if Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. But wait, when I computed Layer9, I thought it was 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. So Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. But when I thought about computing Layer9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841=29524, that's correct. Then the final result is 3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. Wait, but earlier I thought Layer9 was 29524, but when I compute 3*Layer9, that's 3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.

Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers, let me recompute a couple more layers. Let's check Layer 7 and beyond:\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9840.

Then 1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524=88572, then 1 +88572=88573. Wait, hold on, that's conflicting. Wait, no, because Layer9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. So Layer9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. The confusion was because I was thinking of Layer9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or a formula, but given that it's only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. However, if the number of layers were much larger, we might look for a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nLet me just summarize the layers again to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've double-checked each step, and each layer's computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n- 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add them up to verify. 29524 +29524 = 59048. Then 59048 +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 +3=4 Correct.

Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n where a_1=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1, a_3=1+3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute it using the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Therefore, the expression is (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer's value and build up to the final result. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, which simplifies the computation significantly. Applying this formula confirms the result obtained by manual layer-by-layer calculation.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my computations again because I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2.

Wait, let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which grows exponentially. The values are increasing rapidly, which makes sense given the multiplication by 3 each time. So, after computing each layer up to the ninth one, and then multiplying by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my computations again because I might have made an error in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built by this recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is n=1, and the outermost is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Alternatively, if I let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 layers, but that might not help directly. Wait, but perhaps if I expand it step by step, I can see a pattern. Let me try expanding the first few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 2, it was 13, but E_2 would be 3*(Layer 2) = 39. Similarly, E_3 = 3*(Layer 3) = 3*40=120.\n\nWait, but earlier, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). Let me see:\n\nE_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 +12)=39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2)=3*(1 +39)=120\n\nE_4=3*(1 + E_3)=3*(1 +120)=363\n\nE_5=3*(1 + E_4)=3*(1 +363)=1092\n\nE_6=3*(1 + E_5)=3*(1 +1092)=3279\n\nE_7=3*(1 + E_6)=3*(1 +3279)=9840\n\nE_8=3*(1 + E_7)=3*(1 +9840)=29523\n\nE_9=3*(1 + E_8)=3*(1 +29523)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, that's a different approach but arrives at the same result. So, E_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. Let me try.\n\nGiven E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1=12.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved similarly to before. Let me write it as E_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the homogeneous solution would be similar. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1}=0, which has solution E_n = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C => C - 3*C =3 => -2C=3 => C= -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nApplying initial condition E_1=12: 12 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A=13.5 => A=4.5=9/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2 = (9*3^n - 3)/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{3} -3)/2=(27 -3)/2=24/2=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: (81 -3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nn=3: (243 -3)/2=240/2=120. Correct.\n\nn=4: (729 -3)/2=726/2=363. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, E_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the previous result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the closed-form formula for a_n, or model the entire expression as E_n with its own recurrence, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
