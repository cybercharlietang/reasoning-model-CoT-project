    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit? Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute Layer 1 through Layer 9 to make sure each step is correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time, especially if the number of layers was larger. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow the pattern of a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1), but I might be misremembering the exact formula. Alternatively, for a recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + s*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1). In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 =4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} =0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, Layer 4. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, Layer 5. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, Layer 6. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, Layer 7. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, Layer 8. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, Layer 9. So, the formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I have n layers, the total would be (3^{n} -1)/2, but in this case, since the expression is 3*(...), it's 3 times that. Wait, actually, in our problem, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Wait, let me clarify: the innermost is Layer 1:1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9:29524. Then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572. So, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. That's another way to look at it. So, the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. Let me compute 3^{11} to verify: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct. So, that's another way to arrive at the same answer without computing each layer individually. That might have been more efficient, especially if the number of layers was larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know the formula in case the problem scales up. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to derive a formula to compute the value of the innermost expression directly, which then allowed me to compute the entire expression efficiently. This approach avoids the tedium of computing each layer step by step and reduces the chance of making an arithmetic error along the way.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently.\n\n1. **Identify the Recurrence Relation**: Each layer \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for such a recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For the innermost layer (n=9), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can verify the multiplication. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 20 = 59044, 59044 + 4 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 20 = 88568, 88568 + 4 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572. Hmm, but let me also check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, all steps seem correct. Therefore, I think 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it with a formula. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n starts from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9, which is the outermost layer, is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the formula confirms my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression to see if it's a geometric series. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step, but that might take a long time. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, since each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the inner part is E' = 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, but actually, in this case, each layer is E = 3*(1 + 3*E'), but in this specific problem, each layer is only up to nine layers, so it's finite. If it were infinite, we could have used a different approach, but since it's finite, the step-by-step or the formula approach works better. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units. So, starting from the right: 4 (units) *3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next, 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next, 5 (hundreds) *3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next, 9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next, 2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, but let me check that. 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total is 3*a9 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, this seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula instead of computing each layer step by step. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. Let me just verify once more that the formula is correct. Since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we found a closed-form solution using standard techniques for linear recurrences, it should be correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

So, the first digit is 2 (units place), then 7 (tens place), then 5 (hundreds place), then 8 (thousands place), then 8 (ten-thousands place). So, the number is 88572. So, 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down as 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute any incorrectly.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which could help verify the result without computing each layer.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by another layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3. So Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40.

So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form solution for the recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems accurate. I think I did each step correctly.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested multiple times. Alternatively, it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1. But wait, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_2 in this sequence. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the total expression would be 3*f(9).

    "text": " Hmm, wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, right? So from right to left: 4, 2, 5, 9, 2. So first digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Second digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. Let me verify the layers again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for L_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the hundreds place? Wait, no, let me count the digits correctly. 29524 is 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3: 4 (units) *3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5 (hundreds)*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it together, starting from the units: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524=59048, then +29524=88572. Yes, so 88572 is the correct result. Wait, but in my previous step-by-step, I thought I had 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But wait, earlier when computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me go back to check if that was correct. Because maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's retrace each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I was computing each layer, I thought I was going up to Layer 9, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I should compute each layer again to confirm. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step manually without using the formula, just to confirm. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute each step without using the formula, it still works out.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step confirms that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me check with another method. 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000. 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3). 476 \u00d7 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me check if I did each layer correctly, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the total expression is 3*L9. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for Ln. Each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting from L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like Ln = a*Ln-1 + b is Ln = a^n * (L0) + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, b = 1, and L1 = 4. Wait, but in the standard form, the recurrence is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, with L0 given. But here, L1 = 4, and L2 = 1 + 3*L1, so maybe the initial term is L1 = 4, and the recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n \u2265 2. So, to model this, perhaps we can write Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThe standard solution for such a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 1, L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2, L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3, L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n = 9, we have:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually, which would be especially useful if the expression had more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on and applying the formula saved time and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested form where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the result of the next inner layer.

Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\".\n\nStarting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). So, how many layers?

(1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?

Because each time you go in, you add another layer, and the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1, then each outer layer adds one more.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is (1+3), and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I went up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed a_9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But I want to make sure that each a_n is correctly calculated.\n\nLet me recompute each a_n step by step to be thorough.\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the general formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost and working outwards, which I did earlier, and it led me to the same result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer, verifying each step, and even deriving a general formula to confirm, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place. So, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, reading from top, it's 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r). Wait, but in this case, r = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be a bit different. Alternatively, since each term is a geometric series, perhaps I can express it as a sum. Let me think. Starting from a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, so each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using either iterative computation or recognizing the recurrence relation, we find the value of each layer until the ninth layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check 29524 \u00d7 3 using another approach. 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's 88572, which matches the addition method. So, where did I go wrong in the direct multiplication? Let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8,7,5,7,2, which is 87572. But that's conflicting with the other methods. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result should be 87572. But when I broke it down into place values, I got 88572. There's a contradiction here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the place values. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again by place value:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 88572, which is correct. Therefore, my earlier direct multiplication must have been wrong. Let me check that again. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing the result. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits in order from the last carryover to the first: 8 (from 2\u00d73+carryover 2), then 8 (from 9\u00d73+1), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), then 2 (from 4\u00d73). So, the number is 88,572. Wait, no, that would be 88,572, but 88,572 is 88 thousand, which is more than 29,524 \u00d7 3, which should be around 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572. So, in my initial direct multiplication, I must have misaligned the digits, thinking that the first digit is 8, but actually, it's 88,572. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I thought it was 87,572, but now I'm getting 88,572. Let me confirm once again. Let's compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Yes, that's correct. I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the original problem. The expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, Layer 4:1+3*40=121, Layer 5:1+3*121=364, Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key was to break down the problem into smaller, manageable layers, compute each one step by step, and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. Also, double-checking the multiplication helped me catch my earlier mistake.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit? Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, units digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Tens digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side is A*3^n + B, right side is 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, so I'm more confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since it's nested, it's more of a geometric progression in the exponents. But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result, so I think I'm good. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, no, 5 is the third digit from the right. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here where each layer follows a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems like a recurrence relation. If I denote L(n) as the value of layer n, then L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in L(1) = 4 into the equation: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I've already computed. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step and even found a pattern that could have saved time if I had recognized it earlier. It's interesting how these nested expressions can often be simplified using recurrence relations. I should remember that for future problems. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a formula, I arrived at the answer 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L(n) \\) where \\( L(1) \\) is the innermost layer. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L(n) = 3 \\cdot L(n-1) + 1 \\) with \\( L(1) = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L(2) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L(3) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L(4) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L(5) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L(6) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L(7) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L(8) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L(9) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Verify using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation:\n   - The general solution is \\( L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer:\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let me add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did it digit by digit, I thought I got 88572 as well.

So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one layer and have the error propagate. Let me go back through each layer and check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n =3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K =3K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms the result. So, yes, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to compute this more efficiently instead of calculating each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer evaluating to 29524.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, maybe it's a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D, then substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and it worked out. So, whether by recognizing the pattern and using the formula or by computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the same result.

Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, recognized the pattern, solved the recurrence relation, and confirmed the result using the formula. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence relation gives us a closed-form formula, which confirms that the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time if there are many layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this recurrence relation as: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's better to solve it step by step. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, find the homogeneous solution by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently, especially if there are many layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently.

So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing this manually. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since it's a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check that. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. So, my final answer should be 88572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recurrence relation as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step. L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using exponents. Since each layer is a function of the previous one, and we've modeled it as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to think about it. Instead of computing each layer, I can recognize the pattern as a geometric series and compute it using exponents. This might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, either method works. I think I've double-checked my work enough times to be confident that the answer is correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + \\dots )))\\), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(L_n\\) represent the value at the nth layer. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General Solution:**\n   Solving the recurrence, we find:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer:**\n   For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, the final answer is 88572. But I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the expression, the innermost is \"1+3\", which is Layer 1: 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have 8 layers, would that make the outermost expression 3*(Layer 8). But in the expression, the number of \"1 + 3(\" is 8, but the innermost is \"1 + 3)\", which is Layer 9. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each layer is defined as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general formula.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the layers again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I've got the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, and each term adds 1. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might help, but in this case, since it's a recurrence, the formula I derived earlier is more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and then multiplying the result by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the hundreds place, right? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, when multiplying by 3, starting from units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me confirm that. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to check. 29524 * 3: 30000 *3 =90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3)=90000 - 1428= 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, let me check Layer 7 again. Layer7:1 +3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1 +3*Layer5=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. So, Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121. a_5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364. a_6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093. a_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280. a_8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841. a_9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524. So, yeah, that's the same as before. So, a_9=29524, then the total expression is 3*a9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a_n = B. Then substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Hmm, but our a_n are positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful, but perhaps we can find a pattern. Alternatively, let's write out the terms in terms of a_1: a_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +3*(4)=13. a3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*(13)=40. a4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*(40)=121. a5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*(121)=364. a6=1 +3*a5=1 +3*(364)=1093. a7=1 +3*a6=1 +3*(1093)=3280. a8=1 +3*a7=1 +3*(3280)=9841. a9=1 +3*a8=1 +3*(9841)=29524. Alternatively, notice that each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for a_1=4. If n=1, (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. But a1=4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking of a different recurrence. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, which matches a4=121. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364, which matches a5=364. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, which matches a6=1093. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, which matches a7=3280. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, which matches a8=9841. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, which matches a9=29524. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which is what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without going through each layer, I could use this formula. Since there are 9 layers, n=9, so a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then total=3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out for each layer. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1= C*3^{1} -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. So, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition: a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, since the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), so \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because if I messed up any layer, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, each step is correct. Therefore, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the original expression starts with 3 times the first layer, which is Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. Let me check with a different approach to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, if I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but that seems like an infinite series. However, in our case, it's finite with nine layers. But perhaps I can use the formula for a finite geometric series. Wait, but in our case, each term is 1 + 3*previous term, which is a linear recurrence. So, the closed-form formula I found earlier is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, after n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to compute this is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, with nine layers, the value inside is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147\n\nThen, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as follows: Let me denote the innermost expression as x. Then, each layer adds 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer. So, starting from x=1+3, then next layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. So, with nine layers, the expression can be represented as a function applied nine times. But I think the recurrence relation approach is clearer.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute each layer more quickly using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n=1 to 9, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, regardless of the method, the answer seems to be 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each layer once again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from 1.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches.

Each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. It's like each step is following the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n...\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it. If I denote Layer n as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, I think. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then we find a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer without manually calculating each step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula in case the problem scales up.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute Layer 9 directly, saving time.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I was able to compute the value efficiently. The final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 1: } 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 2: } 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 3: } 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 4: } 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 5: } 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 6: } 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 7: } 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 8: } 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 9: } 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n3.

So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.
