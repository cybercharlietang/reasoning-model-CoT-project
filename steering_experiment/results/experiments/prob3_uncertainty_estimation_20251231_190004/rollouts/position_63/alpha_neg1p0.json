Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication once more because sometimes when we do it quickly, we can make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87000\n\n524 * 3: 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So 1500 + 60 + 12 = 1572\n\nSo total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nWait, let's say I compute Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So, if I model each layer as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nRearranging: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it with the formula. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible, though time-consuming. Using the formula is better for understanding the underlying structure.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we arrive at the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The formula derived from the linear recurrence confirms the result, ensuring accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer and applying the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find the general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572? Wait, no, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just confirm once more by another method. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each a_n can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see if I can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series. For example, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13. a_3=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Hmm, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 is 40? Wait, 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes, correct. So a_n is the sum of a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and n terms. The sum of a geometric series is S_n = (r^n -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, so S_n = (3^n -1)/2. Wait, but earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for a_1, S_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, perhaps my indexing is off. Wait, a_1 corresponds to n=1, but in the series, it's 1 + 3, which is two terms. So maybe a_n is the sum of n+1 terms? Let's check: For a_1, which is 4, that's 1 +3=4, which is two terms. So S_2 = (3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. a_2 is 13, which is 1 +3 +9=13, which is three terms. S_3=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3=40, which is 1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is four terms. S_4=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So in general, a_n = S_{n+1} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 is 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully.

So 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because I see nine sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as (1+3)=4, Layer 2 as (1+3*4)=13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Which is the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Therefore, the final answer should be 87572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=1+3*4=13, n=3: a3=1+3*13=40, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might make it easier. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. Let's compute a1: a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=87572. Therefore, the final answer is 87572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 87572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recursive approach, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

So the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer and see if I did each step correctly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*L_9, where L_9 is as above. So, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer manually, and both methods give the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so 3 times that would be 88572.

So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. So Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I included the 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from 1 + 3. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4 (from 1 + 3). Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut I think computing each step as I did before is straightforward and less error-prone. So, unless there's a formula that can compute a_n directly without iterating, which might be more efficient, but since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: For n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nFormula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, that's an interesting approach. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{11}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nThen, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 /2 =88572.\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, we get 88572 as the answer, which is consistent with computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, checked my work, and even found an alternative method to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", I'll count it as a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 (this is Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have a new \"(\", so let's count:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3(Layer3)\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3(Layer4)\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3(Layer5)\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3(Layer6)\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3(Layer7)\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3(Layer8)\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to see if I made any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, just to confirm.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis seems like a geometric sequence, perhaps? Let's see if there's a formula for L_n.\n\nEach term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} = 59049, and 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches our earlier computation. Good. So, using this formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step or applying a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is computed based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n without computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an additional 1 each time. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. So yes, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the general formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think that's thorough enough.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 =4, then a_2 =1 +3*a_1, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Hmm, let's see. Let me compute a few terms using the formula and see if they match.\n\nIf n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but in our case, a_1 is 4. So maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + something. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's better to model it as a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p -3*a_p =1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's take a smaller expression with fewer layers. For example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. That gives me more confidence that my answer is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions, which might help in computing them without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, the approach was to recognize the nested structure, compute each layer step by step, and then verify using a formula derived from the recurrence relation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result into the formula. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression at the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do this step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors earlier. Let's go through each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand all the parentheses, it's going to be a sum of 3's raised to different powers. Let me try to see the pattern. Let's denote the entire expression as E. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express E as a sum. Starting from the innermost term: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see how many terms there are. Each time we expand a layer, we multiply by 3 and add 1. So, the number of terms would correspond to the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, starting from 3^9 up to 3^1, but let me check. Wait, actually, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think recursively. Let me denote S(n) as the sum for n layers. Then, S(n) = 3*(1 + S(n-1)). Wait, that's similar to the recurrence relation we had before. So, S(n) = 3 + 3*S(n-1). Hmm, but in our problem, E is S(9). Wait, but according to our earlier computation, E = 3*S(9), no, wait: No, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), so E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(1 + S(8)), where S(8) is the inner expression with 8 layers. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, since we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and E = 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this becomes (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see if that's possible. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It says: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n10. 3(1+3)\n\nWait, that's 10 layers? Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of ( after the initial 3. The first ( is at position 1: 3(1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( is a new layer. So, the expression has 9 layers of nesting, each adding another 1+3(...). So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think my initial counting was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer9 being 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write down the structure:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each * represents a multiplication by 3, and each ( adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is Layer1, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the parentheses. Let me count the number of \"1+\" inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1: 1+3\n2. Layer2: 1+3(...)\n3. Layer3: 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1+3(...)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9 being 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recursive formula.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolve for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nLayer1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4 (n=4): a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5 (n=5): a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6 (n=6): a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7 (n=7): a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8 (n=8): a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9 (n=9): a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed each layer step by step, double-checked using a recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, equating terms:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula works. Let's say n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Which matches the first layer: 1+3=4. Good. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=13. Which is what I had for Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40. Which matches Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Perfect. So the formula works, so applying it for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, let's see. Actually, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I did. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for such a recurrence relation, a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me test this. Assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, simplifying both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 at the ninth layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, the result is 88572. But wait, let me verify with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Let me go back through the layers to check for any possible errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or find a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1, r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but wait, let me check that formula again. Actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms. Let me see. Let me try to expand the innermost expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13. Then, 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*13=40. So, each time, it's 1 +3*previous. So, as I saw earlier, each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, the closed-form formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, yeah, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as x: x =1 +3=4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 +3x=1 +12=13. Then, next:1 +3*(13)=40, etc. So, each time, it's 1 +3*previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, as before. But perhaps I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand the innermost expression and see if it forms a pattern. Let me consider how many terms there are. Each time we have a 1 plus 3 times something, which when expanded, adds another power of 3. Let me try to see how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 +3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, that's one layer, then each additional layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, in total, there are nine layers. Wait, but when I computed a_9, that was for nine layers, right? So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to check. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as (3^{10} -1)/2 *3, which is (59049 -1)/2 *3=59048/2 *3=29524*3=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I could recognize to compute it more efficiently, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step manually isn't too bad. Another way to think about it is that each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is just 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524, then the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just kept computing each layer step by step, which I did, and it still gave me the correct result. So, both methods work. The recursive approach is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for nine layers, either way is fine. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way up.

Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 88572. Wait, that seems right because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be a bit less than 90,000, which 88,572 is. Let me verify with another method.

Let's add:\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\n- 59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048\n- 79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from the digit-by-digit method. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me do it again: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it by breaking into parts, I got 88572 as well. Because 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step is feasible. If there were more layers, perhaps a formula would be better, but for nine layers, step-by-step computation is okay. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did before. So, the recurrence is correct. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but wait, let me check that. Wait, no, the standard form for a recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + c is a bit different. Let me recall the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since I'm just starting out, maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach to avoid confusion. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a formula for such a sequence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, but since I was unsure at first, going step by step was a good way to verify each layer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3, so it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. However, since each term is added to 1 before being multiplied by 3, it's not exactly a simple geometric series, but the closed-form formula we derived earlier still applies.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to E = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, that might not be accurate because each layer is nested, so perhaps that approach isn't straightforward here.\n\nBut in any case, since I've verified it both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, comparing to the standard form, k = 3, c = 1, and a_0 would be the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps the index starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a homogeneous and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, I broke down the problem into manageable layers, computed each step carefully, and then used a formula to confirm the result. This dual approach helps ensure that there were no arithmetic errors along the way. I think that's thorough enough. So, the final answer should be 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer.

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recount each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Let me try that approach. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and n=9 here, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result, so I feel confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error in the computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1, then L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which in this case is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is known. For a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b * (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 = 4, so maybe L0 would be something else. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L9, which is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nThen, (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since I already got 88572 by computing each layer step by step, and the formula confirms it, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the formula again.\n\nWe had L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so each layer is a term in a geometric progression.\n\nBut perhaps the way I did it before is sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps are:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524.\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer, which might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step again, but this time using the formula for each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I've got it right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. The first term is 4, then each subsequent term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, but in our case, each term is 1 + 3*previous term, which is similar to the recurrence relation we had earlier.\n\nSo, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found.\n\nThus, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the digits. Let's write it out:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's a recursive expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe this can be represented as a geometric series or using some formula for such recursive expressions.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems to work. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it with the formula saved a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a linear recurrence relation.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**:\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This structure repeats 9 times, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**:\n   Let L_n represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is:\n   L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Find the General Solution**:\n   The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved to find a closed-form expression:\n   L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**:\n   Substitute n=9 into the formula:\n   L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   The entire expression is 3 times L_9:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
