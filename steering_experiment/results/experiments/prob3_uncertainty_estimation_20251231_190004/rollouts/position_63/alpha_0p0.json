    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can compute the answer directly without computing each layer. That might be faster for larger expressions. But since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. Either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps again because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step as I did before is feasible. However, for practice, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3a_p + 1 => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've done everything correctly. I computed each layer step by step, then verified using a recurrence relation approach, and both gave me the same result. So, I think I'm good.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming if there are more layers. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Alternatively, since it's a first-order linear recurrence, I can write it as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression, but since each term is built upon the previous, the recursive approach is more straightforward. In any case, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing the recursive pattern and using a formula to find the value of each nested layer.\n\n1. **Identify the Recursive Pattern:**\n   Each layer follows the form $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$ with $L_1 = 4$.\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   The general solution is $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$.\n\n3. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   For $n = 9$, $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The final result is $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model this. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in this sequence.\n\nSo, the general term for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which adds more confidence in the answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've computed each layer step by step, checked my work, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, that can't be right because 30000 * 3 is 90000, so 29524 * 3 should be 88572, not 87572. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation.

Wait, but 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572, because 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. So I think I made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the digits are 8,7,5,7,2?

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I think I wrote 1093 earlier, but actually, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Wait, so in my initial calculation, I wrote 1093, which is correct because 1,093 is the same as 1093 without the comma. So that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recursive pattern.

Let me compute each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 is the same as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just noticed that when I did the initial computation, I wrote 88572, which is the same as 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nLet me just make sure that I didn't skip any layers or miscount the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added constant. But in this case, since the recurrence is linear, the approach I took with the general solution is more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, I can use another approach. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and we have a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, everything lines up.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work multiple times, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify my steps because I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify each step once more. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. 1+3*40=121. 1+3*121=364. 1+3*364=1093. 1+3*1093=3280. 1+3*3280=9841. 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula: a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So that's 59048. Now add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So the result is 88572. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. So starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which is always reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. But in this case, since the multiplier is 3 and the additive term is 1, the recurrence is linear and we can solve it as above.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is defined in terms of the previous one, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each step is 3*(previous step) + 1. This is similar to the expansion of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added. The formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, is a direct result of solving the recurrence relation. So, using that formula, I can compute a_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That would save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know the general formula in case the problem becomes more complex or has more layers. So, to recap, the steps I took were: 1. Recognize that the expression is a nested recurrence relation. 2. Start computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. 3. After computing each layer, substitute its value into the next outer layer. 4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3 as per the original expression. 5. Double-check each computation to ensure accuracy. 6. Derive a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relation techniques to confirm the result. 7. Use the formula to compute the value directly and confirm it matches the step-by-step computation. 8. Finally, multiply by 3 to get the final answer. This methodical approach helps prevent errors and ensures that each step is correct. It's easy to make a multiplication mistake when dealing with large numbers, so verifying each layer and then using a formula is a good way to confirm the result. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula give the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, the final answer would be 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula instead of computing each layer. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as I computed earlier. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, the innermost layer is layer 9, and the outermost layer is layer 1. Wait, actually, maybe I have to think of it the other way around. When I compute from the inside out, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around. So, if there are 9 layers, then the outermost expression is layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10} = 59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since each layer n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is layer 9, then the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Subtracting 1 gives 59048, which divided by 2 is 29524. Multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, we're computing n_{k} = 1 + 3n_{k-1}. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to go through each layer manually.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. If I have n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, and starting with n_1 = 4, then n_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for n_k.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: n_k = 3n_{k-1} + 1, with n_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is n_k - 3n_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is n^{(h)}_k = A*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say n^{(p)}_k = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when k=1, n_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, n_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, n_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*n_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using this formula. Since each layer is n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so n_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Looking back at the original problem: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time I see a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer wraps around that, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, which would be the outermost.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer, so 9 layers in total.\n\nThus, using the formula, n_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*n_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach, perhaps by expanding each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again, just to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 3*29524 using another method.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's compute:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdd the units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.

Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer and computing each step carefully, I managed to get through it without making any mistakes. It's interesting how each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. It almost forms a geometric progression, but since each term is inside another multiplication, it's a bit more involved. I guess the key here was patience and careful computation at each step to avoid errors. I didn't make any mistakes this time, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). We compute each layer from the innermost outwards:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6.

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the number is 87,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +60=88,560. 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29,524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Let me verify the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3,279=3,280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3,280=1 +9,840=9,841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9,841=1 +29,523=29,524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. This expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see what n corresponds to each layer. Wait, in our earlier calculation, a_1 was the innermost layer, which is 1+3=4. Then a_2 was the next layer, which was 1+3*a1=13, and so on up to a9=29,524. So, using the formula, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*(29,524)=88,572. So, that confirms the result using the formula. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Progressive Layers**: Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recheck each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct). Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute step by step or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about the recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without using the formula, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but using the formula is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we can efficiently compute the value.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make the computation faster. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That reminds me of a geometric series or something that can be represented as a sum. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), with n layers. In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and n = 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, but in this problem, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which itself has 9 layers. So, maybe it's 3*(expression with 9 layers). Let me see if I can find a formula for the inner expression with k layers. Let's denote E(k) as the expression with k layers. So, E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. E(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. E(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, I can see a pattern here. Let me compute a few more to see if I can find a formula. E(1) = 4. E(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, I wonder if there's a formula for E(k). Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is E(k) = 1 + 3*E(k-1), with E(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is E(k) = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. When k=1, E(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's plug in k=2, E(2)=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4. 2) 9A + B = 13. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is E(k) = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2. Simplify that: E(k) = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2. Which can also be written as E(k) = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I have. For k=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For k=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula E(k) = (3^(k+1) -1)/2 holds true. Therefore, for k=9, E(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E(9)= (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, E(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9)=3*29524=88572. That's the same result as before, so it seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.

So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, +1000 = 89000, +60 = 89060, +12 = 89072. Wait, that's different from the previous method. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

    "text": " Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 3 * 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see: Let's write down the first few terms: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which is the same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers, but since there were only nine, computing step by step wasn't too bad. Either way, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply the final result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
