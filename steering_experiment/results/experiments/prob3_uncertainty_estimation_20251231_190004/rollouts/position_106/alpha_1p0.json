    "text": ". So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + B + 1. Hmm, that suggests 0 = 1, which is a contradiction. That means our initial assumption is missing something. Maybe the particular solution isn't just a constant. Perhaps we need a particular solution of the form C*3^n + D. Wait, but that's similar to the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution should be a constant. Let me try again. Assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, so equate LHS and RHS: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Hmm, so maybe the particular solution is a constant. Let me try a particular solution of the form a_n = C. Then, plug into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, solution is a_n = A*3^n. So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, perhaps my initial guess is missing something. Maybe the particular solution isn't just a constant. Let me try a particular solution of the form a_n = C, a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer using exponents. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and starting from a_1=4, we can see that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + something? Wait, no, I think the formula we derived earlier is correct. So, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check. 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = A*3^n + 3B. So the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. Similarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. So this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then, Layer 2 would be n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which also matches. Similarly, Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result.

So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's solid.

Perhaps the particular solution isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution is different. Let me try solving the recurrence properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.

Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plug into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solve for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.

So maybe the homogeneous solution is different. Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution needs to be adjusted. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Perhaps the particular solution is a constant. Let me try a particular solution of the form a_n = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing a few layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, using the formula, a_9=29524, multiply by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that seems fractional. But our initial terms are integers. Let me see if this holds. Then, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer.

    "text": ". So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: A*3^n + B + 1. Wait, that would imply A*3^n + B = A*3^n + B + 1, which would require 0 = 1, which is impossible. So perhaps my assumption is missing something. Maybe the particular solution needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is correct, but the particular solution is a constant. Let me try a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus three times the next layer.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the approach. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the RHS is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.
