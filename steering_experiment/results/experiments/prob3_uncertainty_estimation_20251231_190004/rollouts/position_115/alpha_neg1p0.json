    "text": " So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no. Wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, a_9 would be the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula: total expression = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.
