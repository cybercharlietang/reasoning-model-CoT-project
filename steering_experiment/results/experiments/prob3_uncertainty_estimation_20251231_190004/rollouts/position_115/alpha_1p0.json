Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2. Then each subsequent layer adds another exponent. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.
