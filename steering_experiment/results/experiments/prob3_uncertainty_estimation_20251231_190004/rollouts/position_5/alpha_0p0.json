    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like a recursive or repetitive structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. \n\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another set of parentheses: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Wait, actually, looking back at the original problem, each level is $1 + 3(\\text{next level})$, and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I need to handle each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer separately to avoid confusion. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers, each multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Inside that, there's another layer: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me try to count how many times 3 is multiplied. It seems like each time, we have a new layer of 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds a 3 multiplied by the next expression.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1+3 terms. So, maybe there are nine layers. Let me check.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous result), and each of these is multiplied by 3 at the next level up.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, let's compute each layer step by step, moving outward.\n\nLet me number the layers from inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3 * 29524:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, or use the recurrence relation formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I didn't make any calculation errors, as both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses and multiplication by 3. By breaking down each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\), multiplied by 3. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\):\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For Layer 9 (\\(n = 9\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   Then, multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: (1 + 3) = 4.

Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3(4) first: 3 * 4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I take the innermost parentheses, compute it, and then replace it in the expression. So, moving out one more layer, the next part is (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3(13) = 39.

Hmm, let me calculate that step by step. \n\nFirst, 29525 * 3:\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n- 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nWait, let me do that properly:\n\n29525\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9.\n\nWait, actually, 29525 has digits: 2,9,5,2,5.

Wait, when I computed 3*(29525), I got 88575, but earlier steps might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, let me double-check my computations step by step because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers or in the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1.

So, 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*29524), but that was incorrect. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, after the 9th layer, we have 3*(29524). Because the expression after 9 layers becomes 3*(result). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier step where I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*29524) was wrong because I miscounted the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nEach time, we're replacing (1 + 3*(...)), so each step, we have a 3 multiplied by the result, plus 1. So, after 9 layers, we have 3*(the result of the 9th layer). So, the 9th layer gives us 29524, so the final step is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*29524), which would be 3*(88573), but that's incorrect. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, when we have the expression 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, after 9 layers, we have 3*(result of the 9th layer). So, after 9 layers, the expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*29524). No, actually, no. Wait, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), so each time, you compute (1 + 3*(inner result)), and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, each step is (1 + 3*(...)), and each time, you compute that and replace it, then move outwards.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is (1 + 3*previous result). So, step 1: 4.\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524.

But no, actually, the outermost layer is just 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, indeed, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer? Or is it the 8th? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the 9th layer because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and there are 9 such layers. So, after computing 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the outermost 3* that, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write down the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using a formula. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me denote the nth layer as L_n.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to express L_n in terms of a formula.\n\nLet me consider that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Work Outwards Layer by Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar, just repeated multiple times. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, I see a 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3( something ). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time there's a 3(1+3(...). Let me count the number of times the 3(1+3 appears. It seems like it's repeated 9 times? Wait, let me check:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(1+3))\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3( something ). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(innermost), then the next layer is 1+3*(previous layer), and so on, until we have 9 layers. So, maybe the expression has 9 layers of nesting? Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, if I have 9 layers, that would mean the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1+3*(... So, how many times does the 3*(1+3*(... occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(1+3))\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, which suggests that there are 9 layers. So, the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(previous layer), and this repeats 9 times. So, the total expression is 3 multiplied by a 9-layered expression. So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way outwards.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start by computing the innermost part first. The innermost part is 1+3, which is straightforward. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this layer becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result is 13, so this layer is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). Let me try to tabulate this to keep track.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost expression inside the initial 3*(...). So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. Because when I get to layer 9, I have 1 + 3*(layer 8). So, layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... inside is layer 9.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 88572, but let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got layer 9 as 29524, so 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 =1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Because sometimes when I count layers, I might miscount. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(... So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(... So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is added. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(... So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1+3(... So, the first opening parenthesis after 3 is layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, which means 9 layers. So, my initial count was correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula here. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40.\n\na_4=1+3*40=121.\n\na_5=1+3*121=364.\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093.\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, each term is defined recursively as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1.\n\nSolving for K: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the value is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result:88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous term). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost term is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all 9 layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like a recursive structure, but maybe I can just work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's write this out step by step. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4). Let's compute the multiplication first: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that level gives us 13. Now, moving another level out, we have another (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). Let's do that.\n\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*13). Compute 3*13: 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Let's go another level out.\n\n4. Next level: (1 + 3*40). Compute 3*40: 120. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, that's 121. Continuing outward.\n\n5. Next level: (1 + 3*121). Let's compute 3*121: 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay, let's keep going.\n\n6. Next level: (1 + 3*364). Compute 3*364: 1092. Add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's getting large. Let's proceed.\n\n7. Next level: (1 + 3*1093). Compute 3*1093: 3279. Add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, 3280. Let's move out another layer.\n\n8. Next level: (1 + 3*3280). Compute 3*3280: 9840. Add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThat's 9841. Continuing.\n\n9. Next level: (1 + 3*9841). Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9841*3. Let me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 800*3 = 2400\n- 40*3 = 120\n- 1*3 = 3\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost parentheses, which is the entire expression: 3*(result from step 9). So, let's compute that.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 29524*3 is 88572? Let me compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the digits. Let me write it properly.\n\nActually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let's compute:\n\n- Units place: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. So, yes, 29524*3 is indeed 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check all the previous steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake earlier on.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each step manually. \n\nLooking at the structure, each step is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a sequence:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a\u2081 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each a_n, it's equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that in our problem, we have a\u2089, since we started from a\u2081 up to a\u2089.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result: 88572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach, and both lead me to the same conclusion. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure that there are no mistakes in the calculations, especially with such a lengthy expression. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I think I'm set.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next level:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\cdot 4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next level:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\cdot 13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next level:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\cdot 40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5.

Finally, compute the outermost expression:\n    \\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It seems like there's a pattern here, so maybe I can solve it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, maybe I should just start evaluating from the inside and work my way out.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 * 4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that result: 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nWait, so the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, I think I need to work step by step, each time replacing the innermost parentheses with their computed value.\n\nLet me try to outline the layers:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(result) + 1\n3. Then, the next layer: 3*(result) + 1\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each layer to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), so let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 +1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) +1 = 3*13 +1 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(13) + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) +1 = 120 +1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(121) +1 = 363 +1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(364) +1 = 1092 +1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1093) +1 = 3279 +1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(3280) +1 = 9840 +1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(9841) +1 = 29523 +1 = 29524\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) +1 = 13\n3. 3*(13) +1 = 40\n4. 3*(40) +1 = 121\n5. 3*(121) +1 = 364\n6. 3*(364) +1 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) +1 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) +1 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) +1 = 29524\n\nWait, so the original expression has 9 layers, right? Because each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), and starting from the innermost, we have 9 of them. So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9) +1? Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), so actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) at the very end, and each layer adds another 3*(...) +1.\n\nSo, let me list each layer step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on, the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire inner expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524, not 3*29524 +1. Because the inner expression after 9 layers ends with a ), so the outermost is 3*(result of inner expression). Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(...) +1, and this repeats 8 times, and then the outermost is 3*(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the outermost is just 3*(...), without adding 1. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) +1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(13) +1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) +1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(121) +1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(364) +1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1093) +1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(3280) +1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(9841) +1 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so that's the key point. The inner expression, after 9 layers, is 29524, and then the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted.\n\nLet me write down each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) +1 = 13\n3. Next: 3*(13) +1 = 40\n4. Next: 3*(40) +1 = 121\n5. Next: 3*(121) +1 = 364\n6. Next: 3*(364) +1 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*(1093) +1 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*(3280) +1 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*(9841) +1 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a layer.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each being (1 + 3(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, yes, after 9 layers, we have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's take a simpler version of the problem.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 +1 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*13 +1 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, the innermost is 4, then 3*4 +1=13, then 3*13 +1=40, then outermost is 3*40=120. So, the result is 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in this smaller example, after 3 layers inside, the outermost is 3*(result). So, similarly, in the original problem, after 9 layers, the outermost is 3*(result of 9 layers). So, yes, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my computation of 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is 3 times something inside parentheses, which itself is another similar expression. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer:\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3 \\times 4 ))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that again. The innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is 4. So, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(that result). Let me make sure I'm replacing correctly.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n(1 + 3*(result from above)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, the expression now becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13 ))))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, each time, we compute the innermost and work outwards.\n\nSo, maybe I should label each layer to keep track. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, actually, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d73=60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20 \u00d73=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nHmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom Layer1 to Layer2: 3*4 +1=13\n\nLayer2 to Layer3: 3*13 +1=40\n\nLayer3 to Layer4:3*40 +1=121\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is 3n +1, where n is the previous layer.\n\nSo, starting with Layer1=4,\n\nLayer2=3*4 +1=13\n\nLayer3=3*13 +1=40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer9.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\n\nThe general formula for such a recurrence relation is:\n\nIf a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4,\n\nThen the solution is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nLet me see if that's the case.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na1=4\n\na2=3*4 +1=13\n\na3=3*13 +1=40\n\na4=3*40 +1=121\n\nWhich matches the layers above.\n\nThe standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (k^{n} -1)/(k -1) * c + a1*(k^{n-1})\n\nWait, maybe I should derive it.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, we can write it as:\n\na_n + d = 3*(a_{n-1} + d)\n\nTo find a constant d such that this becomes homogeneous.\n\nSo, a_n + d = 3*a_{n-1} + 3d\n\nBut a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, so:\n\n3*a_{n-1} +1 + d = 3*a_{n-1} +3d\n\nThus, 1 + d = 3d \u2192 1 = 2d \u2192 d=1/2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\na_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} +1/2)\n\nTherefore, the sequence b_n = a_n +1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nThus, b_n = b1 * 3^{n-1}.\n\nGiven that a1=4, then b1=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nSo, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^{2} * 3^{n-1}) / 2 = 3^{n+1}/2.\n\nThus, a_n = b_n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check with n=1:\n\na1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 is a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if it matches.\n\nCompute a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=13\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=40\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=121\n\na5=(3^6 -1)/2=364\n\na6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093\n\na7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280\n\na8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841\n\na9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524\n\nYes, all correct. So, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the inside: The innermost part is (1+3). So let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is 4. So that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1+3(...). Since the innermost was 4, the next expression would be 1 + 3*4. Wait, no, hold on. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(next part)). So actually, each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, maybe I should represent this as a series of operations, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So starting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So maybe my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for the outermost 3 correctly.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So actually, each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), except the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo perhaps I need to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost, and each time, multiply by 3 and add 3 to the next level. Let me try this again.\n\nLet me think of it as a recursive expression. Let me define each level as a function of the next level. Let me denote E(n) as the expression starting from the nth level.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is E(9) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen E(8) = 1 + 3*E(9) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE(1) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E(1)). So the entire expression is 3*(E(1)).\n\nSo E(1) is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo how many nested 1+3(...) are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost, then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another level.\n\nSo from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So when I computed E(9)=4, E(8)=13, up to E(1)=29524, and then multiplied by 3, getting 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*previous result.\n\nSo:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost is 3*(Level 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nHmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, but since it's only nine levels, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me recount each step:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplications and additions seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So it's a recurrence relation where E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're starting from the innermost, E(1) is the innermost, and each subsequent E(n) is built from the previous. So actually, it's more like E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4.\n\nSo for n=2: E(2)=1 +3*4=13\n\nn=3: E(3)=1 +3*13=40\n\nn=4: 1 +3*40=121\n\nAnd so on, up to n=9: E(9)=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*E(9)=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n). Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is E(n) -3*E(n-1) =1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving E(n) -3E(n-1)=0, characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's try a constant particular solution, say E_p.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: E_p -3*E_p =1 => -2E_p=1 => E_p= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is E(n)=A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow apply initial condition E(1)=4.\n\nSo E(1)=A*3^1 -1/2=3A -1/2=4.\n\nSo 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: E(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, E(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo E(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result. Then the total expression is 3*E(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's another way to confirm the result. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same number.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as \\( E(n) \\) where \\( n \\) starts from the innermost level. \n\n1. Compute the innermost level:\n   \\[ E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent level using the result from the previous level:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   E(2) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(1) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\n   E(3) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(2) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\n   E(4) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(3) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\n   E(5) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(4) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\n   E(6) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(5) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   E(7) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(6) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   E(8) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(7) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   E(9) &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E(8) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost level by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot E(9) = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or a recursive way to approach this. Let me try to work from the innermost parentheses outward because that's usually how you handle parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1+3. That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, I have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the value from the inner expression.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after nine layers, I get 29524. But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to 29524, I need to multiply that by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3 times the result of the innermost computation.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and this happens nine times, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the entire thing. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, I get 29524, and then I multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps earlier, I went up to 29524, which was after nine layers. But in the problem, after the innermost 1+3, there are eight more layers, making it nine in total, and then the outermost 3. So, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to 29524, that was after nine layers, right? So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by that 29524.\n\nSo, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing each step, I ended up at 88573, but that was including the outermost 1 + 3*(29524). Wait, no, I think I confused myself.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and this happens eight more times, making it nine layers in total inside the outermost 3.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, I get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing step by step, I ended up at 88573, which was because I included an extra 1 + 3*(29524), but actually, the outermost operation is just 3*(29524), not 1 + 3*(29524). So, I think I made a mistake in my earlier step-by-step where I included an extra layer.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and this happens eight more times, making it nine layers in total inside the outermost 3. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, I get 29524, and then I multiply that by 3, which gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me compute each layer again carefully:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so the result inside is 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I thought I had 29524 after nine layers, but I mistakenly thought I needed to compute one more layer, leading me to 88573, which is incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check my calculations again to be sure. Let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, after nine layers, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I had before.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88573, but that was because I mistakenly included an extra 1 + 3*29524, which isn't part of the problem. The problem only has nine layers inside the 3*(...), so after computing those nine layers to get 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3 terms inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's nine layers. So, after computing those nine layers, we get 29524, and then the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses is another similar expression. So, maybe I can solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40.\n\nWait, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer). Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result.\n\nLet me try to tabulate this to keep track. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9.

So, after the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Hmm, that seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nBut maybe I should just compute each step one by one to avoid confusion. Let me list them out step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5.

Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*88573. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, compute 88573 * 3.\n\nCompute 80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\nCompute 8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n\nCompute 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\nCompute 70 * 3 = 210\n\nCompute 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, so the entire expression simplifies to 265,719.\n\nBut let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*88573. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 70 = 210\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 8,000 = 24,000\n\n3 * 80,000 = 240,000\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count extra. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is (1+3*(previous)).\n\nSo, how many times do we do this? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), each inner part is another layer. So, the number of layers is 9. Because from the innermost (1+3), each time we go out, it's another layer. Let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), then each time moving out, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 layers. So, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to 88573, then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each step, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mathematical formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Hmm, but in our case, the innermost is (1+3) which is 4, so maybe a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nSo, if I consider the recursive relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nWait, but let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, after 9 layers, I got 29524, which is correct because a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, which gave me 265,719. But according to this formula, a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572, which is different.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the indexing. Let me see.\n\nIn the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer.\n\nBut in our problem, the innermost layer is (1+3) = 4, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, ..., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I had 10 layers, ending up with 88573, which was then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be a confusion in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer is (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 9 layers because after the initial 3(...), there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to count the number of layers.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- The outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nInside that, we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times do we have (1+3(...))?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 29524\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = 88573\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers because starting from (1+3) as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another, so up to layer 10.\n\nBut in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers starting from 1.\n\nSo, if we have 10 layers, then a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, a_10 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation earlier. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost layer is layer 10.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The first (1+3(...\n2. Then, each subsequent (1+3(...\n\nSo, from the initial 3(...), inside it is (1+3(...)), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that is another (1+3(...)), layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n10. (1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(...), meaning 9 layers, right? Because each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 10 layers, which seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3(...), inside it is (1 + 3*(...)), which is layer 1.\n\nInside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nFrom the outermost layer:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n2. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n3. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n4. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n5. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n6. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n7. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n8. Inside that: 1+3*(...\n9. Inside that: 1+3*(1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of (1+3*(...)), starting from layer 1 (outermost) to layer 9 (innermost).\n\nWait, but when I computed step by step earlier, I started from the innermost as layer 1, and went outwards to layer 10. So, perhaps that's where the confusion is.\n\nIf in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost, then a_9 would be the result after 9 layers from the innermost, which would correspond to the outermost layer being 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIf I consider the innermost layer as layer 1, then each outer layer adds a new layer, up to layer 10 being the outermost.\n\nBut in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression, which has 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the innermost being layer 1, then each outer layer adds another, so the outermost layer is layer 10.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(layer 9), because the innermost is layer 1: (1+3).\n\nThen, layer 2: (1 + 3*layer1)\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*layer2)\n\n...\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3*layer9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer10.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because the expression is 3*(layer10), but in our earlier step-by-step, we had 10 layers, ending at 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719.\n\nBut in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, if the innermost is layer 1, then layer 10 would be a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nBut in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*a_10.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another (1+3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers of (1+3*(...)), then the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost layer is layer 10, which is inside the 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not.\n\nIn the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to 10 layers, which would be a_10 = 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of pattern. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute that.\n\nWait, let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3 times a big parentheses, and inside that, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Hmm, actually, when I started counting, I went from the innermost to the outermost, but I need to make sure I have all the layers correct.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): \n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n2. Then 1+3*(4) = 13\n3. Then 1+3*(13) = 40\n4. Then 1+3*(40) = 121\n5. Then 1+3*(121) = 364\n6. Then 1+3*(364) = 1093\n7. Then 1+3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then 1+3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Then 1+3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the total number of computations I need to do is 9 steps inside, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, let me list them again to make sure I didn't skip any:\n\n1. Start with 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, that looks correct. So after 9 layers, we get 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me do this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- There's a 9 in the ten thousands place: 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2, but wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the places.\n\nWait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. It's easy to miscount the number of parentheses. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the main expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, I did 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then the final multiplication by 3 gives the answer.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, resulting in 29524, and then multiplied by 3 is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572.\n\nSame result. So, confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter evaluating all the layers, we get the result 29524. Now, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning it's a series of expressions within expressions. Each part inside the parentheses is another similar expression. So, maybe the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, that's a lot of levels. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Each time, it's multiplied by another expression, so maybe there are nine layers here? Let me check.\n\nStarting from the inside: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, each time, we have a new layer where 3 is multiplied by the result of the previous layer. So, if I start from the inside and work my way out, each step will involve computing one layer at a time.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one and keep track of the results.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost one.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (L9). So, after computing L9, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I can compute it another way.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, +120 = 29,520, +3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and then multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is being computed correctly, and then the final multiplication by 3 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression.\n\nSuppose we have an expression of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nIn this problem, a is 1 and b is 3, and n is 9 layers.\n\nWait, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, L1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so L1 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\nL_k = A*3^{k} + C, where A is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let's solve the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = A*3^{k}\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^{(p)} = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when k=1, L1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for k=1, L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2\n\nThus, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger k.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify that L9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation, solve it, and compute the desired layer directly using the formula.\n\n5. Verify each step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_k \\) where \\( k \\) is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\n1.

So, after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my computations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit from right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total value is 88,572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without so many steps.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that's another way to compute it.\n\nWait, 29,524 = 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\n476 * 3 = 1,428.\n\nThus, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It looks recursive, almost like a pattern that repeats itself. So maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier. That usually works with nested expressions, right?\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by a similar expression. So, if I number them from the inside out, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times (1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original problem, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, perhaps I should approach it by starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times another expression. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: \n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...). It seems like there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, that suggests that there are 9 layers here. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and working my way out.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's easier if I write each layer as a function of the next. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost one, and L1 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L8 = 1 + 3*L9\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd so on, until L1 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L1). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L1), where L1 is 1 + 3*L2, L2 is 1 + 3*L3, etc., down to L9 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is L9 = 1 + 3, then L8 = 1 + 3*L9, and so on until L1 = 1 + 3*L2, and then the entire expression is 3*L1.\n\nWait, so maybe I should compute each layer starting from L9 and moving outward, each time using the result from the previous layer. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's define each layer:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L1 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120=360, plus 3=363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*364. 3*360=1080, 3*4=12, so total 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL1: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nStarting from L9 = 4\n\nThen L8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from L9, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nSo, if I think of it as a recurrence relation, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nWith L9 = 4\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence and solve it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n.\n\nLet me think: Each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nSo, starting from L9 = 4\n\nThen,\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, I notice that each L_n is 1 + 3 times the previous L. So, it's like each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, starting from 4, each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, perhaps the sequence is:\n\n4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nWait, that's 9 terms, right? From L9 to L1.\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, we can solve it using the formula for linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n+1} + b, where a=3, b=1.\n\nWait, actually, it's L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nWhich can be rewritten as L_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can express this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think. If I unroll the recurrence, perhaps I can express L1 in terms of L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nBut L2 = 1 + 3*L3\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3 + 9*L3\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L4\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 + 9*(1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*L4\n\nContinuing this way, each time expanding the terms.\n\nSo, in general, L1 = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*L_{n+1}\n\nWhere n is the number of layers.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, from L9 to L1.\n\nSo, n=8, because L1 is the 9th term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nIf I consider each step as multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from L9=4.\n\nSo, L8 = 3*L9 + 1\n\nL7 = 3*L8 + 1 = 3*(3*L9 + 1) + 1 = 3^2*L9 + 3 + 1\n\nL6 = 3*L7 + 1 = 3*(3^2*L9 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3*L9 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nContinuing this pattern, each L_n = 3^{k}*L9 + 3^{k-1} + ... + 3 + 1, where k is the number of steps from L9 to L_n.\n\nSo, for L8, k=1: L8 = 3^1*L9 + 3^0 = 3*4 +1=13\n\nFor L7, k=2: L7=3^2*L9 + 3^1 + 3^0=9*4 +3 +1=36 +4=40\n\nSimilarly, L6=3^3*L9 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=27*4 +9 +3 +1=108 +13=121\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculations.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 3^{k}*L9 + (3^{k} -1)/ (3 -1) ), since the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^{k-1} is (3^{k} -1)/2\n\nSo, for L1, which is 8 steps away from L9, k=8\n\nTherefore, L1 = 3^8 * L9 + (3^8 -1)/2\n\nGiven that L9=4\n\nSo, L1 = 3^8 *4 + (3^8 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561\n\nSo, 3^8=6561\n\nTherefore, L1 = 6561*4 + (6561 -1)/2\n\nCompute 6561*4: 6561*2=13122, so 13122*2=26244\n\nCompute (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280\n\nSo, L1=26244 + 3280=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L1=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, starting from 4.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, the result seems to be consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nL7=1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nL6=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nL5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nL4=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nL3=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nL2=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nL1=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step without defining layers, just by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nNext: 1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121\n\nNext:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364\n\nNext:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572\n\nSame result. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. But in this case, since we're starting from the innermost term and working outward, it's more of a linear recurrence.\n\nBut regardless, all methods point to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, step by step, and each time I get the same answer.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the last part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So that part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(that result). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The innermost part is 1+3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of innermost). So actually, it's 1 + 3*(4). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each time, you have 3*(1 + something). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Then the next is 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Hmm, this seems like a pattern. Let me check.\n\nWait, let me list them out step by step. Maybe I can write down each layer as I go from the inside out.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer, then each 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. So how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Hmm, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so each time there's a 3 followed by another (1+3(...)). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested. So the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 3*(1 + 4)=15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15)=3*16=48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48)=3*49=147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147)=3*148=444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444)=3*445=1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335)=3*1336=4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008)=3*4009=12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027)=3*12028=36084.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested. So the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the first 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then each subsequent 3 is inside another (1+3(...)). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by a (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3s after the first one. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each followed by a (1+3(...)). So that would mean there are 9 layers in total? Wait, no, because the innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So actually, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses. The expression ends with 9 closing parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, each ( adds a new layer, and each ) closes it. So the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses, which is 9, but starting from the first 3, each layer is a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Wait, no, actually, the first 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer, then each subsequent 3 is inside that. So perhaps there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, the result is 36084. Is that the final answer? Let me check.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s. The first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is inside. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) adds another 3. So how many 3s are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - first 3\n\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) - second 3\n\n3. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) - third 3\n\nAnd so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo how many 3s are there? Let's count:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo after the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside. So starting from the first 3, the next 3 is the second, then third, etc., until the innermost 3. Let me count them:\n\n1. First 3: 3(\n\n2. Second 3: inside first 3's parentheses: 3(\n\n3. Third 3: inside second 3's parentheses: 3(\n\nContinuing this way, how many 3s are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3, which is the ninth 3, because each layer adds another 3. Wait, no, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo the first 3 is the outermost. Then inside that, another 3, so that's two. Then another 3, making three, and so on, until the innermost 3 is the ninth 3. So that would mean there are 9 layers. So the innermost is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nSo the final result is 36084. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nStarting from layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1+4)=3*5=15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1+15)=3*16=48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1+48)=3*49=147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1+147)=3*148=444. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24, so 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1+444)=3*445. Let me compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15, so 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1+1335)=3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1+4008)=3*4009. Let me compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1+12027)=3*12028. Let me compute 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo each step checks out. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can represent this expression without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think.\n\nThis expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered layer 1 as 1+3=4, which is a_1=4.\n\nThen a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=15.\n\na_3=3*(1 + a_2)=48.\n\nThis seems to form a recursive sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but actually, each a_n is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, no, because a_1 is 1 + 3 =4, then a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(1+4)=15, and so on.\n\nWait, but if I think of this recursively, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1=4.\n\nThen, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1=4.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=3*(1 +4)=15\n\na_3=3*(1 +15)=48\n\na_4=3*(1 +48)=147\n\na_5=3*(1 +147)=444\n\na_6=3*(1 +444)=1335\n\na_7=3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\na_8=3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\na_9=3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is 3 times (1 + previous term). So the recurrence is linear, but non-homogeneous.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1=4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because our terms are positive and increasing. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different method, like unfolding the recurrence.\n\nLet me try to write out the terms:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\na_{n-1} = 3 + 3*a_{n-2}\n\nSubstituting back:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 3 + 9 + 9*a_{n-2} = 12 + 9*a_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, a_{n-2} = 3 + 3*a_{n-3}\n\nSo, a_n = 12 + 9*(3 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 12 + 27 + 27*a_{n-3} = 39 + 27*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this way, we can see a pattern emerging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nLet me try to unroll the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\n= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2})\n\n= 3 + 9 + 9*a_{n-2}\n\n= 12 + 9*(3 + 3*a_{n-3})\n\n= 12 + 27 + 27*a_{n-3}\n\n= 39 + 27*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this, we can see that each time, the coefficient of a is multiplied by 3, and the constant term is 3*(previous constant + 3*previous coefficient).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that the recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression, but with each term scaled by 3 and added 3.\n\nLet me try to express a_n as a sum.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me try to express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1)\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + a_1)) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*a_1\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... )\n\nWait, perhaps we can see a pattern where a_n = 3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIf a_n = 3^n - 3/2, then for n=1, a_1=3^1 - 3/2=3 - 1.5=1.5, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution.\n\nWe have the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K => K - 3K =3 => -2K=3 => K= -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n= C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4= C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4= 3C - 1.5 => 3C=5.5 => C=5.5/3=11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplifying, 3^n can be written as 3*3^{n-1}, so:\n\na_n= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1= (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2= (11/6)*3 - 3/2= (11/2) - (3/2)= (11 -3)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2= (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - (9/6)= (99 -9)/6=90/6=15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3= (11/6)*27 - 3/2= (297/6) - (9/6)=288/6=48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4= (11/6)*81 - 3/2= (891/6) - (9/6)=882/6=147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5= (11/6)*243 - 3/2= (2673/6) - (9/6)=2664/6=444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6= (11/6)*729 - 3/2= (8019/6) - (9/6)=8010/6=1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7= (11/6)*2187 - 3/2= (24057/6) - (9/6)=24048/6=4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8= (11/6)*6561 - 3/2= (72171/6) - (9/6)=72162/6=12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9= (11/6)*19683 - 3/2= (216513/6) - (9/6)=216504/6=36084. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=36084.\n\nThus, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9= (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo a_9= (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6= 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 *11= let's compute 3280*11= 36,080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36,080 +5.5=36,085.5\n\nThen subtract 3/2=1.5: 36,085.5 -1.5=36,084.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then tried to find a pattern and a formula to generalize it, which confirmed the result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(3 \\times (1 + \\text{previous result})\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a repeating pattern. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Wait, actually, let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression, I see that there are nine opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the innermost, I need to compute each step one by one.\n\nLet me list them out step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: 3*(result from step 1) + 1\n3. Next level: 3*(result from step 2) + 1\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost level.\n\nWait, actually, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe I can represent each step as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is computed based on the previous one.\n\nLet me denote each step as a_n, where n is the level of nesting. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine levels of nesting.\n\nWait, let me check how many levels there are.

Therefore, I need to compute a_1 to a_9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial expression is 3*(...), so perhaps the sequence starts at a_0 or something. Hmm, maybe I should adjust my indexing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recursive function where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, starting from 1, and then multiplying by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it step by step manually, since there are only nine levels, it's manageable.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level out:\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext level:\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext level:\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext level:\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext level:\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext level:\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext level:\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so the innermost parentheses gave me 4, then each subsequent level gave me 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nSo, the innermost is 4, and each step outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). After nine steps, I end up with 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing all the inner parentheses, which gives me 29524, I then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n--------\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the levels correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each time wrapping it with (1 + 3*(...)), how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3)\n\nThen, (1+3(...))\n\nEach time, we have another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, there are nine such sections, right?\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(...)), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, the first step is (1+3), then the next step is 1+3*(result), up to nine times.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had nine steps, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4, and ending at 29524, then multiplying by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, let me think about the recursive formula. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, after n steps, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have nine levels of nesting, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's a nested expression, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time, you're adding 1 and then scaling by 3, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and also derived a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- Each subsequent level: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n\n- After nine levels: 29524\n\n- Multiply by 3: 88572\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and compute each subsequent level:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 &= 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 and then 3 times something. Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, let's compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, so the next one out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me see if I can tabulate this to keep track.\n\nLet me list the levels from the innermost to the outermost, computing each step:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses. So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no. Let me go back. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the parentheses. So when I computed Level 9 as 29524, that's actually the value inside the outermost parentheses. So then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the structure again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, when I get to Level 9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I stopped at Level 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. So, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I added up the parts, I got 88572 as well. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I computed Level 9 as 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my levels to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the previous level's result. So, Level 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each level step by step.\n\nI notice that each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the outermost operation is indeed 3 times a_9.\n\nYes, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is a_1, working up to a_9, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, yes, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each level, by using the formula.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each level step by step correctly, and the formula confirms it, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through the step-by-step computation again.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\n3. Level 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\n4. Level4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\n5. Level5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\n6. Level6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. Level7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. Level8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. Level9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, all the intermediate steps check out. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could also think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, it's a bit different, but the formula I derived earlier still applies.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each level adds another 1 and multiplies by 3, building up the value step by step.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each level step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3.

That usually works with parentheses. Let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So the innermost expression is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have another 1+3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So it's like a recursive expression, where each step depends on the one before it.\n\nLet me try to parse this expression more carefully. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... and so on, nine times? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Hmm, from the start, I see 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let me count the opening parentheses. Each time there's a \"(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the first 3, there's a (1+3(... So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the first one. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then another ( at position 5, then another at 8, and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2.

Then another ( at position 29: 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses before it closes. Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer: 3(1+3(\n- Then another 1+3( inside that: 3(1+3(1+3(\n- And so on, until the last one is 1+3(1+3), which is the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(... So that's the first layer. Then inside that, another (1+3(... So that's the second layer. Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then inside that: 3(1+3(\n3. Then another: 3(1+3(\n4. Then another: 3(1+3(\n5. Then another: 3(1+3(\n6. Then another: 3(1+3(\n7. Then another: 3(1+3(\n8. Then another: 3(1+3(\n9. Then another: 3(1+3(\n10. The last one: 1+3)\n\nWait, no, because the expression ends with 1+3)), so the innermost is 1+3, which is 4. Then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So maybe there are 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers? Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside that: (1+3(\n3. Then another ( inside that: (1+3(\n...\nContinuing until the end.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me look at the string:\n\n\"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then (1+3(\n3. Then (1+3(\n4. Then (1+3(\n5. Then (1+3(\n6. Then (1+3(\n7. Then (1+3(\n8. Then (1+3(\n9. Then (1+3(\n10. Then (1+3(\n11. Then (1+3)\nWait, no, because the innermost is 1+3), so maybe it's 9 layers?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2 is the next one out, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 total so far: 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 total: 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 total: 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 total: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count too many.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I have 9 layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside that: (1+3(\n3. Then another ( inside that: (1+3(\n4. Then another: (1+3(\n5. Then another: (1+3(\n6. Then another: (1+3(\n7. Then another: (1+3(\n8. Then another: (1+3(\n9. Then another: (1+3(\n10. Then another: (1+3)\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that the innermost expression is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before it starts closing. So that would mean 9 layers, right? Because each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(... So that's the first (.\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(... So that's the second (.\n\nContinuing this way, how many ( are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3.

So perhaps the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each time we go out a layer, we add another (1+3(... So the total number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...

Then another: (1+3)\n\nWait, that's 10 times, but that can't be right because the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, so the number of layers should be 9, not 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(... So that's the first \"1+3(\".\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(... So that's the second \"1+3(\".\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLet me count:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n\"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before it starts closing with )))))).\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of \"1+3(\" by looking for the substring \"1+3(\".\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. After 3, we have (1+3( \u2192 that's the first \"1+3(\".\n\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3( \u2192 second \"1+3(\".\n\n3. Then another: (1+3( \u2192 third.\n\n4. Another: (1+3( \u2192 fourth.\n\n5. Another: (1+3( \u2192 fifth.\n\n6. Another: (1+3( \u2192 sixth.\n\n7. Another: (1+3( \u2192 seventh.\n\n8. Another: (1+3( \u2192 eighth.\n\n9. Another: (1+3( \u2192 ninth.\n\nThen, the next part is (1+3)), which is the innermost, so that's Layer 1.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, which would correspond to 9 layers, meaning Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just verify each layer calculation again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved as a geometric progression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculations.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(k-1))*k^{n-1}.\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1, so the solution is a_n = (1/(3-1))*(3^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - 1/(3-1))*3^{n-1}.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (1/2)(3^{n} - 1) + (4 - 1/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + (7/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nBut let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to recognize the pattern.\n\nBut maybe it's overcomplicating since we've already computed up to Layer 9 manually.\n\nBut just to confirm, for n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. So that formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution.\n\nLet me derive the general solution correctly.\n\nGiven the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving the general formula, so I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe I can solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of problems. Let me write it down again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine layers here. Let me count: starting from the outermost, each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's one layer. So, yeah, nine layers in total. That means I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. \n\nLet me start by labeling each layer from the inside out to keep track. Let's call the innermost expression Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on. \n\nOkay, let's write that out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem, the outermost operation is a 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, Layer 9 is actually 3*(Layer 8). Hmm, that's a bit different. Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8)\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the first eight layers involve adding 1 and three times the previous layer, and the ninth layer is just three times the eighth layer. So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 8 first, then multiply by 3 for Layer 9. \n\nAlright, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, moving on to Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nLet me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, interesting. Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. \n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCalculating 3*121: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363\n\nSo, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMoving on to Layer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092\n\nThus, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279\n\nSo, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840\n\nTherefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, Layer 9 is 3*(Layer 8), so:\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841\n\nLet me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me compute 9841*3 directly.\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo, writing it out: 29523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, let me just double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEach step seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations. \n\nJust to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as:\n\nLayer n: 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), for n from 2 to 8\n\nAnd Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, that formula works perfectly! So, Layer n is indeed (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 8 is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, Layer 9 is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 =29523, which matches my previous result.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 29523 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could write the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I let x = 3, then the expression can be written as:\n\nx*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x*(1 + x)))))))))\n\nWhich is a finite geometric series with 9 terms, but nested in a specific way.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to the formula for compound interest, but in this case, it's a finite series.\n\nBut since I already have the answer using two different methods, I think I'm safe in concluding that the result is 29523.\n\nJust to recap, in case I missed anything:\n\n1. The expression is a nested multiplication with 9 layers.\n2. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. The innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is built by adding 1 and tripling the previous result.\n4. Calculating each layer step by step gives me the final value of 29523.\n5. Using a recurrence relation, I confirmed that each layer follows a specific formula, leading to the same result.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence formula gave the same answer. So, I feel confident that 29523 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down into layers, where each layer is defined as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7}\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}\\)\n\nCalculating each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a repeated pattern. Maybe I can compute it from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of expressions. Let me try that.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression for clarity:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me count the number of 3s to see how deep I need to go. Hmm, actually, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so maybe I can work from the inside out.\n\nLet me label each level to make it easier. Let's say the innermost part is level 1, then the next one is level 2, and so on, up to level 9, which is the outermost part. So, starting from level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving out one level, that result is inside another set of parentheses where we have 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So, Level 2 is:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Level 2 is 13.\n\nNow, moving out to Level 3, which is 1 + 3*(Level 2):\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13 first:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, Level 3 is 40.\n\nAlright, moving on to Level 4:\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's compute that.\n\n121 * 3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363.\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364:\n\n300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is Level 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because that seems like a big number. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me verify each level again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all levels up to 9 are correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3*29524 another way to confirm. Let me do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 7 2 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each level step by step, I end up with 88572 as the final result.\n\nBut wait a second, I just realized that the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, but when I labeled them as Level 1 to Level 9, Level 1 was the innermost, and Level 9 was the outermost. So, when I computed Level 9 as 29524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3s again to make sure I didn't miscount the levels. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level. So, yes, Level 1 is the innermost, and Level 9 is the outermost. So, I think my approach was correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that can help me compute it without expanding each level, which might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, each level seems to follow a pattern. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see if there's a recurrence relation here.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit odd because our a_n are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to solve it as a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method of solving such equations.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(C*3^{n-1}) + 3*D + 1 = C*3^{n} + 3D + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = C*3^{n} + 3D + 1\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n\nThen, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all levels up to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even found a formula to confirm the result without having to compute each level manually. It seems consistent. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each level follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value at each level efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value at the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each level from the inside out**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is built up with a series of nested parentheses. Each parenthesis starts with a 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like a chain: 3(1 + 3(...)). Maybe I can work from the innermost part outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each nested part as a step. So starting from the innermost part:\n\nStep 1: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So that part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next part is (1 + 3(Step 1 result)). Since Step 1 is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Step 2 is 13.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, the expression is (1 + 3(Step 2 result)). Step 2 is 13, so this is (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So Step 3 is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3(Step 3 result)). Step 3 is 40, so (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Step 4 is 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(Step 4 result)). Step 4 is 121, so (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Step 5 is 364.\n\nNext, the expression becomes (1 + 3(Step 5 result)). Step 5 is 364, so (1 + 3*364). Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Step 6 is 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1 + 3(Step 6 result)). Step 6 is 1093, so (1 + 3*1093). Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Step 7 is 3280.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3(Step 7 result)). Step 7 is 3280, so (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Step 8 is 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(Step 8 result)). Step 8 is 9841, so (1 + 3*9841). Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Step 9 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of Step 9. So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524*3 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, wait, no, the number is 29524, so after 2 is 9? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, it's 88572. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each step seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the steps:\n\nAfter Step 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each step is roughly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but let me check:\n\nFrom Step 1 to Step 2: 4*3 +1=13, yes.\n\nFrom Step 2 to Step 3: 13*3 +1=40, yes.\n\nFrom Step 3 to Step 4: 40*3 +1=121, yes.\n\nSo each step is (previous result)*3 +1.\n\nSo starting from 4, each time multiply by 3 and add 1, for 8 more steps? Wait, no. Wait, Step 1 is 4, then Step 2 is 13, which is 4*3 +1. Then Step 3 is 13*3 +1=40, and so on until Step 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo actually, this is a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So maybe we can model this with a formula.\n\nIn general, for a recurrence relation like a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 = 4, we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*A*3^{n-1} + B = A*3^n + B.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nSo substituting, A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 = A*3^n + 3B +1.\n\nTherefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1.\n\nSo, B - 3B =1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2.\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this works with our earlier steps.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3=4.\n\nThen, 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\n1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\n1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\n1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\n1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\n1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\n1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\n1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's a more efficient way to compute this without having to go through each step manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Using the formula I derived earlier seems promising. Since each step is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting from a_1=4, and after n steps, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn this problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, yes, using the formula is a much faster way, especially for larger numbers of layers. It's good to recognize such patterns to save time.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the inside out.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, simplifying as I went.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to find the nth term.\n\n4. Apply the formula to find the 9th term, then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of checking work through multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost part outwards. Each layer is computed step by step, simplifying as we go. \n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each part depends on the next. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is 4, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(that result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct myself. The innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)). So that's 1 + 12 = 13. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay, let's continue.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5.

Finally, the outermost: 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524. \n\n3 * 29524: \n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- The next digit is 9, but wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute it properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7.

Let me check one of the intermediate steps to be sure. Let's say step 5: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, it seems like each step is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). Let's denote each term as a_n, where n is the number of times we apply the 1 + 3*(...) operation.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which we can consider as a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of nesting.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of parentheses. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, and the outermost is the first layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them from the innermost to the outermost as a_1 to a_9.\n\nSo:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, perhaps I can compute a_9 more efficiently.\n\nThis recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nBut we also have a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we obtained earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be error-prone if computed manually step by step.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. The expression can be expanded as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut expanding this manually would be tedious, so the recursive approach and finding the closed-form solution were more efficient.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the result without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses.

It seems like a recursive kind of structure, maybe like a geometric series or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll just start evaluating from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and compute each layer step by step. So, let's count how many layers there are. Each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. The next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3*(4) = 12. Then, we add 1 to that: 12 + 1 = 13.\n\n3. The next layer out would be 3 times 13, which is 39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40.\n\n4. Continuing this way, the next layer is 3*40 = 120, then 120 + 1 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 3*121 = 363, then 363 + 1 = 364.\n\n6. Then, 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next, 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Then, 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next, 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572, plus 1 is 88573.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- The first \"1 + 3(\" is at the innermost part.\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking at the original expression, I see that it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) and there are nine sets of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost \"1 + 3)\". Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n2. 3*(4) + 1 \u2192 13\n3. 3*(13) + 1 \u2192 40\n4. 3*(40) + 1 \u2192 121\n5. 3*(121) + 1 \u2192 364\n6. 3*(364) + 1 \u2192 1093\n7. 3*(1093) + 1 \u2192 3280\n8. 3*(3280) + 1 \u2192 9841\n9. 3*(9841) + 1 \u2192 29524\n10. 3*(29524) + 1 \u2192 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 the first \"1+3(\" is here.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+3(\", so that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 1\n2. The innermost is 1+3(1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. Then another 1+3(...) \u2192 layer 3\n4. And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time evaluating the innermost expression first.\n\nSo, let's list each step with the corresponding layer.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\n- Step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3)\n- Step 2: Use that result in the next layer: 3*(result) + 1\n- Step 3: Use the result from step 2 in the next layer: 3*(result) + 1\n- Continue this until all layers are processed.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the layers are 9 in total, given the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The first inner \"1+3(\" is here\n3. Then another \"1+3(\"\n4. Another\n5. Another\n6. Another\n7. Another\n8. Another\n9. Another\n10. The innermost \"1+3\"\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, perhaps the initial 3 is at layer 0, and then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer up to layer 9.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n2. Then, 3*(4) + 1 = 13\n3. Then, 3*(13) + 1 = 40\n4. Then, 3*(40) + 1 = 121\n5. Then, 3*(121) + 1 = 364\n6. Then, 3*(364) + 1 = 1093\n7. Then, 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280\n8. Then, 3*(3280) + 1 = 9841\n9. Then, 3*(9841) + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) + 1 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see: each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3, making it a total of 10 layers, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute each step methodically, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outwards. So, let's list each step with its corresponding value.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(result from Step 1) + 1. So, 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out: 3*(result from Step 2) + 1. So, 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Then: 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next: 3*1093 + 1. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 3*3280 + 1. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next: 3*9841 + 1. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 + 1. Let's compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, add 1: 88572 + 1 = 88573.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88573.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple steps, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 + 1 = 88572 + 1 = 88573. Correct.\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 88573.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(previous result) + 1. That looks like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, perhaps there's a formula for the sum of such a series.\n\nLet me recall that for a geometric series, the sum S of n terms with ratio r is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term. But in this case, each term is not just multiplied by 3; after multiplying by 3, we add 1. So, it's more like a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost term is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1. Then, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 13, a_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 or a_10, depending on how we count.\n\nWait, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3, so perhaps a_10 is the final result before multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, the initial 3 is outside all the layers, so perhaps the total number of terms is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined by a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\na_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\na_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\na_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\na_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\na_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\na_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\na_10 = 3*29524 + 1 = 88573\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find a general formula for a_n, where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds a new term. So, in the expression, how many times does the pattern \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the initial 3, we have:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 1\n- Then inside that, another \"1+3(\" \u2192 layer 2\n- And so on, until the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is the first layer, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is layer 1, then each layer outwards increases the count.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our earlier calculation, we had 10 layers because we started from a_1 to a_10, but perhaps in the expression, the number of layers is 9, because the initial 3 is outside all the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the expression, the initial 3 is multiplied by a sum that starts with 1 and then has 9 layers of 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of layers inside is 9, making the total layers 10 including the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps in our problem, the initial 3 is applied to a sum that has 9 layers of 3*(...). So, the total number of layers after the initial 3 is 9, which would make n = 9 in the formula.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we had 10 layers, from a_1 to a_10, where a_10 was the result before the final multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. But perhaps in the formula, n corresponds to the number of layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each time we go out a layer, we have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, for the innermost, a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out is a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13.\n\nContinuing this way, up to a_9, which would be the result after 9 layers.\n\nThen, the initial 3 is multiplied by a_9, so the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of 3*(...).\n\nThus, the value inside the initial 3 is a_9, so the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nGiven that, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers after the initial 3, which is 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I had 10 layers, ending up with 88573. But according to this formula, it's 88572.\n\nWait, that suggests a discrepancy. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify: in the expression, the initial 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part has 9 layers of 3*(...). So, the inner part is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step calculation earlier, I went up to a_10 = 88573, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. Let's count how many \"1+3(\" there are:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" \u2192 2\n3. Another \u2192 3\n4. Another \u2192 4\n5. Another \u2192 5\n6. Another \u2192 6\n7. Another \u2192 7\n8. Another \u2192 8\n9. Another \u2192 9\n10. The innermost \"1+3\" \u2192 10\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, making the total layers 10, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the initial 3 is at the top, and each \"1+3(\" is a layer inside it. So, the innermost is layer 1, then each layer out adds a new count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the number of multiplications by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to use the formula again.\n\nIf the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer out is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13.\n\nContinuing up to a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I had 10 layers, ending up with 88573. So, perhaps I included an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is not part of the layers, but the layers start after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The expression is 3*(sum), where the sum is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the sum inside is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWait, no, in the formula, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is slightly different.\n\nWait, in the problem, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...), so it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in this case, the general formula would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the recurrence.\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Each \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.

So, if we have 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 88573. So, perhaps I included an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with a series of nested parentheses. Each one seems to be of the form 1 + 3(something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then working my way outwards. That makes sense because in math problems like this, you usually start solving from the inside and work your way out. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses here. Wait, let me count them. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3*(result of above)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(result of above)\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's nine. Let me check:\n\nStarting after the first 3, the expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3.\n- Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n- Then, the next is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n- This continues until we have nine layers, right? Wait, actually, let's count the number of 3*(...). \n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, the first layer after the initial 3 is one set of parentheses, then another, and so on until there are nine sets. So, that means we have to compute this expression starting from the innermost part and working our way outwards, computing each layer one by one.\n\nSo, maybe the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and compute each step, then plug that result into the next layer, and so on until we reach the outermost part. That way, I can avoid getting confused by the many parentheses.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the result we just got, which is 4, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let's calculate that:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let me keep track of each step so I don't get lost.\n\nSo far, we've computed three layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, I'm computing a new layer, so each step is one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is one layer out. So, let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, that's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, that would be the argument inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because this is a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As before, 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, after double-checking each step, I can confirm that each layer was computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save a lot of time, especially if the expression is longer.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using standard techniques. The solution to a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a geometric series.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me verify that. So, if I consider a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so we solve a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute a_n for any n.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is n=1, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is n=2, n=3, up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, the value at n=9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to manually compute each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only nine layers, either method works, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, which is a geometric progression, we can also express the total computation as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut in any case, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead us to the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing that it is a series of nested parentheses of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{...})\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost part and work our way outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find the value of the innermost parentheses is 29524. The outermost layer is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the result of the computation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So after computing the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(next level), and the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, after computing the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So I think I did that correctly up to step 9, which gave me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So I think I missed that last step. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, after step 9, I have 29524, which is inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So let me compute that.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting over, just to be thorough:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Let me just check each multiplication step to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n- 3*4=12, yes.\n\n- 3*13=39, correct.\n\n- 3*40=120, correct.\n\n- 3*121=363, yes.\n\n- 3*364=1092, correct.\n\n- 3*1093=3279, yes.\n\n- 3*3280=9840, correct.\n\n- 3*9841=29523, yes.\n\n- 3*29524=88572, correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems accurate. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one level, and each \"1+3(...)\" is another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first.\n\nThen, each subsequent level adds another (1+3(...)), so let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\n3. (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time, the number of parentheses increases by one.\n\nWait, maybe I can count the number of \"1+3\" terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent level adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3\" are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is one.\n\n- Then, moving out, each time it's another (1+3(...)), so total number is 9, because the outermost is 3*(...), which has 9 levels inside.\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 8 levels inside. Wait, maybe I need to count the number of \"1+3\" terms.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of closing parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just recount the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 levels inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, total of 10 steps, with the last step being the multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a recursive formula. Let me define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, starting from 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, so starting from 1, then each time adding 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me see. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth level, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the formula.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: Let's compute step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048\n\n59048/2=29524\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's more like a sum of terms where each term is 3^k.\n\nWait, let me think. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nIf I let x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), then x = 1 + 3x, which would give x = -1/2, but that doesn't make sense because x is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step calculation since the formula worked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so it's more like a geometric progression with common ratio 3.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, if I let S be the inner expression, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But that seems recursive.\n\nWait, let me define S as the innermost expression.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the method I used earlier, since it's straightforward and I already got the answer.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nCompute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n=88,572\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of levels again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n\nEach ( corresponds to a level.\n\nLet me count the number of (:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...)) - 1\n\n2. (1+3(...)) - 2\n\n3. (1+3(...)) -3\n\n4. (1+3(...)) -4\n\n5. (1+3(...)) -5\n\n6. (1+3(...)) -6\n\n7. (1+3(...)) -7\n\n8. (1+3(...)) -8\n\n9. (1+3(...)) -9\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that means there are 9 levels inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 levels inside, leading to a_9 =29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think I've double-checked enough times, and I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple levels of parentheses. By systematically working from the innermost parentheses outward, each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. This process is repeated for each level, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the last computed value by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula for the recursive sequence, the final answer is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next part is (1 + 3*(inner result)). Since the inner result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, that's interesting. So now I have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let's see, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Wow, that's a jump. So, moving on, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that. 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so now I'm at 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Calculating that, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, that's getting big. Next, the layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me do that multiplication: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Wow, that's a huge number.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Alright, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. So, 3 times 9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again because 29524 times 3. Maybe I should compute it more carefully. 29524 times 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3 times 88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3 times 265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding them together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 265720 times 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 is 780000; 780000 + 15000 is 795000; 795000 + 2100 is 797100; 797100 + 60 is 797160. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer was: 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, and finally 265720. Then, multiplying that last result by 3 gives 797160.\n\nWait a second, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3(...). Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3)\nThen each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, we have a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). \n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out is another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, each time, we have another layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs, which is 9 times, because each time you have a new opening parenthesis. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, each time, I computed one layer, and I had to compute 9 layers. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 265720*3=797160.\n\nWait, but when I computed the layers, I had 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 1+3*29524=88573, then 1+3*88573=265720. So that's 10 layers? Wait, no, the innermost is 1 layer, then each time you go out, that's another layer. So, starting from 1+3, that's layer 1, then 1+3*(layer1) is layer2, and so on until layer9. So, maybe I have 9 layers.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 instances of 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, meaning I should have 9 results. But in my calculation, I went from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, and then multiplied by 3. That seems like 10 layers, but maybe the initial 3 is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me parse the expression again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of 1+3(...) inside is 9. So, starting from the innermost, each time you have 1+3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous). So, from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573. So that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...). Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 is the 10th operation.\n\nSo, to clarify, the innermost is layer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nLayer10: 1+3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer10)=3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Earlier, I thought the outermost was 3*(265720)=797160, but now I'm thinking it's 3*(88573)=265719. Hmm, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nLet me try to count again. Let's write down the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nSo, that's 10 layers, but actually, the expression is 3*(layer9). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... has 8 layers. Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 instances of 1+3. So, perhaps the innermost is layer1: 1+3=4, then layer2:1+3*4=13, up to layer9:1+3*previous=?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 instances of 1+3. So, the innermost is layer1:1+3=4, then layer2:1+3*4=13, layer3:1+3*13=40, and so on until layer9:1+3*previous. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, let's compute layer9.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3*(88573)=265719, but now I'm getting 3*(29524)=88572. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused with the number of layers.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, compute (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nNext, compute (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, compute (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each time adding a 1+3*(...). So, after 9 layers, we have 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265719.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719, but earlier I thought that was 797160. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first \"1+\", each subsequent \"1+\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each time you have another \"1+3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3(\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the closing ones.\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)) with 9 levels of nesting.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning that after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, layer1: (1+3)=4, layer2:1+3*4=13, layer3:1+3*13=40, layer4:1+3*40=121, layer5:1+3*121=364, layer6:1+3*364=1093, layer7:1+3*1093=3280, layer8:1+3*3280=9841, layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with earlier counts. I think the confusion is whether the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the 9th layer or the 10th layer.\n\nLet me try to structure it as a tree.\n\n- The outermost expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B))\n- B is (1 + 3*(C))\n- C is (1 + 3*(D))\n- And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3)\n\nSo, each time, we have a layer that is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer9), not Layer10. Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer8)), which is 3*(Layer9). So, perhaps I went one layer too far.\n\nWait, let's parse the expression again:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3)=4, then each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a new layer. Let's count how many layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer1)\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13 (Layer2)\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40 (Layer3)\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121 (Layer4)\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364 (Layer5)\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093 (Layer6)\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 (Layer7)\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 (Layer8)\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 (Layer9)\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573 (Layer10)\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(Layer9), because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer8))=3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3*, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps I need to compute 9 layers, meaning Layer9 is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is 3*(Layer10), which would be 3*88573=265719.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nSo, let's compute E_1 to E_9.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that after computing Layer9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was counting, I thought that the expression was 3*(Layer10)=3*88573=265719, but that seems incorrect because the expression is only 9 layers deep, meaning E_9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, to confirm, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each corresponding to a new layer. So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, meaning we have 9 layers, each time adding a new 1+3*(...). So, E_1 to E_9 as above.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think my earlier confusion was because I miscounted the layers, thinking that the outermost 3 was part of an additional layer, but in reality, it's just multiplying the result of the 9th layer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for E_1 to E_9.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think my initial confusion was due to miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers, but now I'm seeing that it's only 9 layers. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 instances of 1+3. So, each \"1+\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, yes, 9 layers, E_1 to E_9, with E_9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me write down the structure to visualize it better.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the expression is:\n1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, if I start from the inside and work my way out, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Hmm, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, actually, looking back, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so there are nine layers in total. That's a lot! So, I need to compute this nine-layer expression.\n\nTo make it manageable, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 is 1+3, L2 is 1+3*(L1), L3 is 1+3*(L2), and so on until L9.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, looking back at the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, L1 is the innermost 1+3, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9). Hmm, let me confirm.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should consider the layers as starting from the innermost 1+3, then each time wrapping it with 1 + 3*(...), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, perhaps I should compute each nested layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute from the innermost:\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27. So, 29524*3=88572. Then, add 1: 88572 +1=88573.\n\nSo, that's the innermost layer. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing all the layers, the innermost becomes 88573, but then we have another layer outside of that, which is 1 + 3*(88573). Wait, but no, I think I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let's go back. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, so the innermost is Layer1, and each subsequent layer wraps around, so after 9 layers, we have Layer9, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that means I need to compute Layer1 through Layer9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to Layer9 being 88573, but that was after computing 9 layers, starting from Layer1=4, Layer2=13, etc., up to Layer9=88573. So, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which would be 3*88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so yes, that would be 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1+3*(...))\n\n3. So, each time, we have another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is Layer1. Then, each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, except the last one, which is just 1+3. Wait, no, in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer is 1+3*(...), up to 8 layers, because the outermost is 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's only 9 layers, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but when I computed up to Layer9=29524, that was only 9 layers. So, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to 88573, which was after 9 layers, but that was because I miscounted. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, so 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, so 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88573, but that was because I had an extra layer. So, actually, the correct number of layers is 9, with Layer9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\n3. (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer1.\n\n- Then, each time we have another (1+3(...)), which is Layer2, Layer3, etc.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3*\" starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 9 layers, but when I computed up to Layer9=29524, I thought that was the innermost, but actually, that's the Layer9, and then the outermost is 3*Layer9, which is 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning it's a bunch of operations inside operations. Each part inside the parentheses has a similar structure: 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems like a logical approach because each step depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last one: 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me substitute the innermost part with 4.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm tracking this correctly. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth one: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, the eighth one is 1 + 3*(ninth one), which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the eighth one is 13. Now, moving out to the seventh one, which is 1 + 3*(eighth one), which is 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the seventh expression is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the sixth one is 1 + 3*(seventh one) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, sixth is 121.\n\nFifth one: 1 + 3*(sixth) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, fifth is 364.\n\nFourth one: 1 + 3*(fifth) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, fourth is 1093.\n\nThird one: 1 + 3*(fourth) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. So, third is 3280.\n\nSecond one: 1 + 3*(third) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. So, the second expression is 9841.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost expression: 3*(second one) = 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to be accurate.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Outermost: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me try another way to see if I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each step.\n\nI notice that each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, if I let each step be a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth expression from the inside. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from before. When I computed the outermost expression, I had 3*9841 = 29523, but here, a_9 is 29524. That seems contradictory. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, no, because in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, a_9 would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3*a_8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the outermost expression was 3*(second one) where the second one was 9841, leading to 29523. But now, if I consider a_9 as 29524, then 3*a_9 would be 88572.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of parentheses. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is one level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3( ... So, each time it's a new level. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps there are 9 levels of nesting? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the outermost 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3( ... )). So, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new level. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) => 1\n2. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3( ... ) => 2\n3. Continuing until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) => 1\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 2\n3. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 3\n4. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 4\n5. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 5\n6. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 6\n7. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 7\n8. Inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 8\n9. Inside that: 1 + 3 => 9\n\nSo, there are 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost expression was 3*(...), where the inner part was a_9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought the innermost was a_1 = 4, then a_2 =13, up to a_9 =29524, and then the total is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my first calculation, I only went up to a_8 =9841, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. So, I think I missed a step.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then each step out adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many steps are there?\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new level. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time after the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\". Wait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" is one level, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's level 1.\n\nThen each time moving out, you have another level. So, total levels: Let's see, starting from the innermost, each parenthesis adds a level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new level, so how many are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is one level, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another level.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) => 1\n2. Then inside that, another \"1 + 3(\" => 2\n3. Continuing until the innermost is \"1 + 3\".\n\nSo, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's 1.\n\nThen inside that, 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), that's 2.\n\nContinuing, each time we have another \"1 + 3(\", so total number of \"1 + 3(\" is 9.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the innermost is 1 + 3, which is level 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of \"1 + 3(\" is 9, so the innermost is level 9, which is 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, level 8: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLevel 7:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLevel 6:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel2:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel1:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level1) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so that would be 3*(Level1)=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the innermost was level1, but perhaps it's better to think that the outermost is level1, and innermost is level9.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the indexing wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I start from the innermost, which is the last \"1 + 3\", that's the first step, a1=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each step adds another layer, so a2=13, a3=40, up to a9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought the outermost was 3*(a8)=3*9841=29523, but that was incorrect because I stopped at a8, not realizing that there's one more layer.\n\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and each closing parenthesis ends a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of closing parentheses is 9, which would mean 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis, except the innermost one. Wait, no, the innermost is \"1 + 3\", then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", each followed by another parenthesis. So, that would mean 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na3 =1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I stopped at a8=9841 and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which was incorrect because I missed the last layer.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(4)=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 =3A + B.\n\nAlso, since the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1, we can solve for A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nB -3*B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThen, from the initial condition: 4=3A + (-1/2) => 4 +1/2=3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this formula applies correctly.\n\nGiven that a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have n=9 layers, so a9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nLet me compute a9 step by step again:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis, except the last one, which is just \"1 + 3\".\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) => 1\n\n2. Then inside that: 1 + 3( ... ) => 2\n\n3. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>3\n\n4. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>4\n\n5. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>5\n\n6. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>6\n\n7. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>7\n\n8. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>8\n\n9. Then:1 + 3( ... ) =>9\n\nWait, but the innermost is just \"1 + 3\", so perhaps the number of \"1 + 3(\" is 9, leading to 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, a9=29524, and the total is 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1, starting from 4, then after 9 layers, it's 3^9 *4 + (3^8 +3^7 +...+3^0)*1.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each step, making sure I didn't miss any layers, and verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous step. After calculating each nested level up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last nested value by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such nested terms.\n\n2. **Start from the innermost term**:\n   - Innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent term** by substituting the previous result:\n   - Term 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n   - Term 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n   - Term 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n   - Term 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n   - Term 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n   - Term 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n   - Term 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n   - Term 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply the ninth term by 3** to get the final result:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, maybe the best way to tackle this is by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach because each inner expression depends on the one before it. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's nine layers deep. Each layer has a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. \n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. \n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. \n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. \n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. \n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. \n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. \n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. \n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I didn't notice any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, maybe I'm counting incorrectly. Let me see: Each time I open a parenthesis, it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 +1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) +1 = 3*13 +1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) +1 = 3*40 +1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) +1 = 3*121 +1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) +1 = 3*364 +1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) +1 = 3*1093 +1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) +1 = 3*3280 +1 = 9841\n\nWait, hold on. That's only 8 layers, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses.

So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my previous counting, I had Layer 1 as innermost, so Layer 9 would be the outermost, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, perhaps I need to compute the innermost part as Layer 1, then compute Layer 2 as 3*(Layer 1) +1, up to Layer 9, which would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the outermost operation is 3*(...). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n---------\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have missed something because the expression is 3*(...), so maybe I don't need to multiply by 3 again. Let me check the structure.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nSo, total is 39.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*(4) = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*(13) = 39\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but in this case, the outermost operation is 3*(13) = 39.\n\nSo, in the original problem, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, the outermost operation is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nSo, 9*3=27, 8*3=24, 4*3=12, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the 9, making it 29,523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29,523.\n\nThen, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524.\n\nCompute 29,524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\nx     3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, set a_n = C, so C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, this method also confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this solidifies the answer. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next layer is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n- Layer 3: (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n- ...\n- Layer 9: The outermost one.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. Each time we add another layer of 3 times something. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. Hmm, actually, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Each time, it's a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let's see how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Next, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. Then, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s before the innermost 1. Each layer adds a 3. Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + 3*(innermost layer)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, no, that might not be the right way. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., from the inside out.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So let me try that.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is Layer9, which would be 36084. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time we add a layer, so starting from 1, how many times do we apply this 3*(1 + ...)?\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds one more set of parentheses. So that would be 8 layers after the first 3.\n\nWait, but when I did the layers earlier, I went up to Layer9, which might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLet me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time we have 3*(1 + ...)\n3. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many layers there are.\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, the layers would be:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut let me check: when I started, I thought each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so if I have 8 layers after the first 3, then Layer9 would be the outermost. Alternatively, perhaps the count is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 3*(1 + ...) operations. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nBut no, wait, that's not the right way. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...\" starts a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another layer, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have \"3*(1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nLet me try to write each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but does the original expression have 8 layers after the initial 3? Let me check.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times do we have \"3*(1 + ...)\"? Let's count the number of times \"3*(1 + \" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nSo, the first \"3*(1 + \" is at the very start, then inside that, another \"3*(1 + \", and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of \"3*(1 + \" is 8 times, because each time we have a new layer. So that would mean that Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer8 is the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer9. Maybe I overcounted by one.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is outside of the layers, and then each layer is a \"3*(1 + ...)\".\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer1)\n\nWhere Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nAnd so on until Layer8, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nSo, let me recompute, considering that there are 8 layers.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nWait, but the initial expression is 3*(Layer1). So the total result would be 3*(Layer1) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation where I got 36084. Hmm, so I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIf the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 3*(1 + Layer2), and so on until Layer8 is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting from Layer8:\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer1) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, which led to 36084, but that seems incorrect because the number of layers should be 8 inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the total would be 36084.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the initial 3*(...) is the outermost, so perhaps the layers are 8, leading to 36081.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify how many layers are inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times \"3*(1 + \" appears in the expression after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, we have \"1 + 3*(...\", and inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...\", etc.\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we have \"3*(1 + ...)\", which is 8 times. So, the layers are 8 in number inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I compute 8 layers, starting from (1 + 3), each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, I get to 12027 as Layer8. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nBut when I compute 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer1, up to Layer9 being 36084, but that would imply that the initial 3*(...) is Layer9, which may not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me approach it differently.\n\nLet me define each nested expression as a function:\n\nLet me define f(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nBut then, the outermost expression is 3*(f(9))?\n\nWait, no, because f(9) is already 3*(1 + f(8)), which would be the outermost layer. So, the entire expression is f(9) = 36084.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the initial 3*(...) as the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each time, we have 3*(1 + previous result). So, the layers are:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the entire expression is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut wait, the initial expression is 3*(Layer9), or is Layer9 the entire expression?\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), but Layer9 is 3*(1 + ...), which is already the outermost layer. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think that the entire expression is 3*(Layer8), where Layer8 is 3*(1 + Layer7), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to write the expression with indices.\n\nLet me define E(n) as the expression with n layers.\n\nSo, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier approach.\n\nWait, but in this approach, E(n) is the entire expression with n layers. So, E(1) is the simplest case, with one layer: 3*(1 + 3).\n\nE(2) would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nE(3) would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), etc.\n\nSo, if I compute E(n), I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, we have \"1 + 3*(...\", and inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...\", etc., until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3*(...\" occur? Let's see:\n\n- After the first 3, we have \"1 + 3*(...\", which is the first occurrence.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...\", and so on until the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" is 8, because each time we have another layer until the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nThe number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each \"1 + 3*(...\" adds another set. So, that would mean 8 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed E(n) earlier, E(8) would be the expression with 8 layers.\n\nWait, let me compute E(n) for n=1 to n=8 using the approach where E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)).\n\nWait, that might be a better way.\n\nSo, if E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen,\n\nE(1) = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + E(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + E(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + E(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + E(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so according to this, E(8) = 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed starting from the innermost, I got 36084. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the two approaches are different because in the first approach, I considered the innermost as Layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), leading to Layer9 as 36084. But in the second approach, where E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), starting with E(1)=12, E(2)=39, etc., leading to E(8)=29523.\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in how the layers are counted.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach where I counted 9 layers is incorrect, and the correct number of layers is 8, leading to E(8)=29523.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3*(...\" appear? Let me count again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3*(...\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, we have:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 first layer\n\nInside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 second layer\n\nAnd so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"3*(1 + 3*(...\" occur after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count the number of \"3*(1 + 3*(...\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, we have \"1 + 3*(...\", which is the first occurrence.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...\", which is the second occurrence.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 8th occurrence.\n\nSo, there are 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of layers is 8, so E(8)=29523.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, when I computed from the innermost, I had 9 layers leading to 36084, which is conflicting.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not.\n\nIn the E(n) approach, E(1) is 3*(1 + 3), which is the simplest case with one layer.\n\nE(2) is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which has two layers.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 \"1 + 3*(...\" layers.\n\nTherefore, E(8)=29523.\n\nWait, but when I computed from the innermost, I had 9 layers leading to 36084.\n\nI think the key is to recognize that the initial 3*(...) is the outermost layer, and the innermost is the 8th layer inside it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, with f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)).\n\nSo,\n\nf(1) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nSo, f(8)=29523.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression, which has 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...), is 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed from the innermost, I got 36084, which seems to be a miscalculation because I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when I computed from the innermost, I considered each \"3*(1 + ...)\" as a layer, leading to 9 layers, but the correct count is 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=8 in the E(n) approach.\n\nE(8)=29523.\n\nAlternatively, when I computed from the innermost, I had:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 15\n\nLayer3: 48\n\nLayer4: 147\n\nLayer5: 444\n\nLayer6: 1335\n\nLayer7: 4008\n\nLayer8: 12027\n\nLayer9: 36084\n\nBut in this approach, the initial 3*(...) is outside of these layers, so the total expression would be 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252, which is way too big, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial approach was incorrect, and the correct way is to consider that the initial 3*(...) is the outermost layer, and the innermost is Layer8, leading to E(8)=29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute step by step from the innermost, correctly counting the layers.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer1\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 \u2192 Layer2\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 \u2192 Layer3\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 \u2192 Layer4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 \u2192 Layer5\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 \u2192 Layer6\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 \u2192 Layer7\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 \u2192 Layer8\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed E(8)=29523, it was different.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not.\n\nIn the E(n) approach, E(1) is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, which is the first layer.\n\nThen E(2)=3*(1 + E(1))=39, which is the second layer.\n\nSo, in the original problem, we have 8 layers, so E(8)=29523.\n\nBut in the other approach, when starting from the innermost, we have 8 layers leading to Layer8=12027, and then the outermost expression is 3*(12027)=36081.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the initial 3*(...) is an additional layer beyond the 8 layers counted from the innermost. So, the total number of layers would be 9.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, we have \"1 + 3*(...\", which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...\", which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 8th layer.\n\nTherefore, the initial 3*(...) is the first layer, and the innermost is the 8th layer.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is Layer8=12027.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8), which would be 3*12027=36081.\n\nBut according to the E(n) approach, where E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1)=12, E(8)=29523.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to resolve this.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that when I define E(n)"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part is inside another part. It's like a Russian doll situation, where each layer has to be opened before you can get to the next one. So, maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is $1 + 3$. That seems simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, $1 + 3 = 4$. Now, replacing that innermost part with 4, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3 \\times 4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. When I replace $1 + 3$ with 4, it should be inside the next layer. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost expression: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from above})$. So, substituting the innermost result:\n\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3(4)$\n\nLet me compute that: $3(4) = 12$, so $1 + 12 = 13$. So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3 \\times 13)))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me make sure I'm substituting correctly. Each time I compute a layer, I should replace the innermost part with its value, and then compute the next layer. So maybe I should work step by step, layer by layer, from the inside out.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 1})$, which is $1 + 3(4)$.\n\n2. Compute $3(4) = 12$, then $1 + 12 = 13$\n\nSo now, the expression is one layer shorter, with the innermost part replaced by 13. Next layer out is $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 2})$, which is $1 + 3(13)$.\n\n3. Compute $3(13) = 39$, then $1 + 39 = 40$\n\nSo now, moving out another layer, the expression becomes $1 + 3(40)$.\n\n4. Compute $3(40) = 120$, then $1 + 120 = 121$\n\nContinuing outward, next layer is $1 + 3(121)$.\n\n5. Compute $3(121) = 363$, then $1 + 363 = 364$\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(364)$.\n\n6. Compute $3(364) = 1092$, then $1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nMoving outward, next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$.\n\n7. Compute $3(1093) = 3279$, then $1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(3280)$.\n\n8. Compute $3(3280) = 9840$, then $1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nContinuing outward, next is $1 + 3(9841)$.\n\n9. Compute $3(9841) = 29523$, then $1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $1 + 3(29524)$.\n\n10. Compute $3(29524) = 88572$, then $1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is 88573, so we compute:\n\n11. $3 \\times 88573 = 265,719$\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high, and I might have made an error in the steps. Let me go through each step more carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\n3. Next: $1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\n4. Next: $1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n5. Next: $1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n6. Next: $1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n7. Next: $1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n8. Next: $1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n9. Next: $1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\n10. Next: $1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\n11. Finally, the outermost 3 times that: $3 \\times 88573 = 265,719$\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed a layer. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I think I did 9 steps, each time computing the innermost and moving out. So, maybe 265,719 is correct. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3 times the previous result, except for the very first 1 + 3. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me represent each step as a term.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the outermost 3 times a10: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step calculation, a9 was 29524, which matches. Then, the next step is a10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573, which is correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nSo, both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give me the same result. That gives me more confidence that 265,719 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify one more time.\n\nCompute each a_n up to n=10:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9:\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, a10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573\n\nThen, 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nSo, both methods confirm the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the computed value is 265,719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It starts from the innermost part and works its way out. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3): That's 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another parentheses where the innermost result is used:\n2. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n\nWait, so step 1 gave me 4, so step 2 becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, step 2 result is 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level:\n3. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 2)).\n\nSo, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, step 3 result is 40.\n\nContinuing outward:\n4. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 3)).\n\n3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Step 4 result is 121.\n\nNext level:\n5. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 4)).\n\n3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Step 5 result is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n6. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 5)).\n\n3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. Step 6 result is 1093.\n\nNext level:\n7. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 6)).\n\n3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. Step 7 result is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward:\n8. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 7)).\n\n3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. Step 8 result is 9841.\n\nNext level:\n9. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 8)).\n\n3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. Step 9 result is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n10. Compute 3*(result from step 9).\n\n3*29524 is... let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error with so many steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations seem right. I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing.\n\nI guess that's the answer then. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I was worried I might skip a step or miscalculate, but going through each part carefully seems to have worked.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this kind of nested expression. It seems like each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe it's a geometric series or something? Let me think about that for a second.\n\nIf I denote each step as a term in a sequence, where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from 1, then each term is generated by that recurrence relation. So, term1 = 1, term2 = 1 + 3*term1, term3 = 1 + 3*term2, etc.\n\nIf I write it out, term1 = 1\n\nterm2 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nterm3 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nterm4 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to term9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*term9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nEach term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = a_{n-1} = B:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 1:\n\n1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 1 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 3/2 => A = 1/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (1/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each term, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (243 -1)/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (729 -1)/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (2187 -1)/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (6561 -1)/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, hold on, in my earlier calculation, step 9 gave me 29524, but according to this formula, a_9 is 9841. That seems inconsistent. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem, the expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_2, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, actually, the number of terms is 9, starting from a_1 up to a_9.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_2, then each layer out adds another term, so the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^9 -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683, so a_9 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step result where the final answer was 88572.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the indexing. Let me recount.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 that's one\n2. Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nEach time I go out, I add another layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers? Let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2013 layer 2\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2013 layer 3\n4. ... and so on until layer 9.\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 88572. That must mean I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3(...)) layers is 9. Each time, it's (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, each layer is one more than the previous.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3) as step 1, up to step 9 being (1 + 3*...). Then, the final step was multiplying by 3, giving 3*29524, which was 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^n -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if there are 9 layers, a_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, and then 3*a_9 = 29523.\n\nBut wait, in my step-by-step, I ended up with 29524 as the innermost term before multiplying by 3, leading to 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nI think I must have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) adds one more.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), how many are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the previous one\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, step 9 gives 29524, which would correspond to a_9 = 29524, but according to the formula, a_9 should be (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula was incorrect because the indexing is off. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from my step-by-step earlier. Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_9 = 29524, but according to the formula, a_9 = 9841. So, I think I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? Each time, another (1 + 3(...)) is added.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = 9841, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 29523.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers leading to 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if there are 9 layers, a_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, step 9 gives me 29524, which is a_10 in the formula? Wait, no, because in the formula, a_1 =1, a_2=4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^n -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if there are 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 29523.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, leading to layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me see. The formula a_n = (3^n -1)/2 is derived from the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =1.\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=1\n\nn=2: a2=4\n\nn=3: a3=13\n\nn=4: a4=40\n\nn=5: a5=121\n\nn=6: a6=364\n\nn=7: a7=1093\n\nn=8: a8=3280\n\nn=9: a9=9841\n\nSo, according to the formula, a9=9841, and then 3*a9=29523.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3)=4 as layer1, up to layer9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the number of multiplications by 3, while my step-by-step counts the number of additions. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the formula, a_n represents the value after n layers, starting from a1=1.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3*a_n, where a_n is the nested expression.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, it's 3*(a), where a is (1 + 3*(b)), and b is (1 + 3*(c)), etc., down to (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) =4, which is a1=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, a1=4\n\na2=1 + 3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, in this case, the formula a_n = (3^n -1)/2 is for a sequence starting from a1=1, but in our problem, the innermost is a1=4, which is 1 +3*1.\n\nSo, actually, in our problem, the number of layers is 9, starting from a1=4, a2=13,... up to a9=29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nBut the formula a_n = (3^n -1)/2 is for a sequence starting from a1=1, so in our case, the innermost is a1=4, which is a2 in the formula.\n\nWait, so if in the formula, a1=1, a2=4, a3=13,..., a9=9841.\n\nBut in our problem, the innermost is a1=4, which is a2 in the formula, and the outermost is a9=29524, which would be a10 in the formula.\n\nSo, a10 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the innermost is a2=4, and the outermost is a10=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a10=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that aligns with my initial step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think my confusion came from the indexing of the formula versus the problem's structure. The formula starts at a1=1, but our problem's innermost is a1=4, which is a2 in the formula. Therefore, the outermost layer in the problem is a10 in the formula, leading to 3*a10=88572.\n\nSo, after this thorough check, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. Since there are multiple layers, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused. So, let's start by identifying the innermost part.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is $(1+3)$. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, $1 + 3 = 4$. Okay, so that part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. But wait, let me make sure I'm tracking the right level. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the next parentheses. So, maybe I should write each step down as I go.\n\nLet me try to outline the structure:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: $(1+3)$\n2. Then, moving out, compute each subsequent parentheses by substituting the result from the inner one.\n\nSo, step by step, it's like this:\n\n1. Compute the innermost: $(1+3) = 4$\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times 4$\n3. Then, use that result in the next layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 2})$\n4. Continue this process until all layers are computed.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost parentheses.\n\n$(1 + 3) = 4$\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4.\n\n**Step 2:** Now, moving one layer out, we have another parentheses: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 1})$.\n\nSo, substituting the result from step 1, we get:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 4$\n\nLet me compute that. First, do the multiplication: $3 \\times 4 = 12$. Then add 1: $1 + 12 = 13$.\n\nSo, the result for step 2 is 13.\n\n**Step 3:** Next layer out: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 2})$.\n\nSubstituting 13, we have:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 13$\n\nCompute the multiplication first: $3 \\times 13 = 39$. Then add 1: $1 + 39 = 40$.\n\nSo, step 3 gives us 40.\n\n**Step 4:** Moving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 3})$.\n\nSubstituting 40:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 40$\n\nCompute the multiplication: $3 \\times 40 = 120$. Then add 1: $1 + 120 = 121$.\n\nStep 4 result is 121.\n\n**Step 5:** Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 4})$.\n\nSubstituting 121:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 121$\n\nFirst, multiply: $3 \\times 121 = 363$. Then add 1: $1 + 363 = 364$.\n\nSo, step 5 gives 364.\n\n**Step 6:** Moving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 5})$.\n\nSubstituting 364:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 364$\n\nCompute the multiplication: $3 \\times 364 = 1092$. Then add 1: $1 + 1092 = 1093$.\n\nStep 6 result is 1093.\n\n**Step 7:** Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 6})$.\n\nSubstituting 1093:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 1093$\n\nFirst, multiply: $3 \\times 1093 = 3279$. Then add 1: $1 + 3279 = 3280$.\n\nStep 7 gives 3280.\n\n**Step 8:** Moving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 7})$.\n\nSubstituting 3280:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 3280$\n\nCompute the multiplication: $3 \\times 3280 = 9840$. Then add 1: $1 + 9840 = 9841$.\n\nStep 8 result is 9841.\n\n**Step 9:** Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from step 8})$.\n\nSubstituting 9841:\n\n$1 + 3 \\times 9841$\n\nFirst, multiply: $3 \\times 9841 = 29523$. Then add 1: $1 + 29523 = 29524$.\n\nStep 9 gives 29524.\n\n**Step 10:** Finally, the outermost layer: $3 \\times (\\text{result from step 9})$.\n\nSubstituting 29524:\n\n$3 \\times 29524$\n\nNow, compute this multiplication. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, 30000 times 3 is 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 24 \u00d7 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all steps check out. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this easier.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})$. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote each layer as $a_n$, where $n$ is the number of layers. The innermost layer is $a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$. Then, each subsequent layer is $a_{n} = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}$. \n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- $a_1 = 4$\n- $a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13$\n- $a_3 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40$\n- $a_4 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121$\n- $a_5 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364$\n- $a_6 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093$\n- $a_7 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280$\n- $a_8 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841$\n- $a_9 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524$\n- $a_{10} = 1 + 3\u00d729524 = 88573$?\n\nWait, hold on. In my previous calculation, the outermost layer was 3\u00d729524 = 88572, but if I model it as $a_{10}$, it's 1 + 3\u00d729524, which is 88573. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nSo, from the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. Continuing, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(...)\" inside each other, right? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. The first one is 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing until the last one is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many times does (1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\n- The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3:\n\n1. First: 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside: (1+3(...\n3. Continuing, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, starting from layer 1 (innermost) to layer 9 (the one right before the outermost 3). Then, the outermost is 3 multiplied by layer 9.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier steps were counting up to step 9 as the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, in my initial calculation, I had 10 steps, but perhaps it's 9 layers inside, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(...\n3. Repeating until the last one: 1+3(...))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then moving outwards, each time we have another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, we have:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a new layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...\n3. Repeating until the last one is (1+3(...\n\nSo, the number of (1+3( is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial step-by-step had 9 layers, and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, in my initial steps, I had:\n\n1. Innermost: 4\n2. Then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572.\n\nWait, that's 9 steps inside, and then the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, in my initial steps, I had 10 steps, from step 1 to step 10, where step 10 was the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nBut if there are 9 layers inside, then step 9 would be the result before the final multiplication by 3. So, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- The innermost is step 1: (1+3) = 4\n- Then step 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n- Step 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n- Step 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n- Step 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n- Step 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n- Step 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n- Step 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n- Step 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n- Step 10: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, but the first 9 steps are the innermost to the one before the outermost, and step 10 is the final multiplication by 3. So, the expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was correct, with 10 steps, resulting in 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I tried to model it as a sequence $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, starting from $a_1 = 4$, I saw that $a_9 = 29524$, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 would be $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$. So that aligns with my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nThe recurrence relation is $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, with $a_1 = 4$.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is $a_n = A \\cdot 3^{n} + B$, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, with $a_1 = 4$.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: $a_n^{(h)} = A \\cdot 3^n$.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution $a_n^{(p)} = C$.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\n$C = 1 + 3C$\n\nSolving for C:\n\n$C - 3C = 1$\n\n$-2C = 1$\n\n$C = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = A \\cdot 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n = 1, $a_1 = 4$:\n\n$4 = A \\cdot 3^1 - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$4 = 3A - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAdd $\\frac{1}{2}$ to both sides:\n\n$4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3A$\n\n$\\frac{9}{2} = 3A$\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n$A = \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is $a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, n = 9 for the innermost layer, but wait, let's check.\n\nWait, no. The innermost layer is n=1, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is n=2, n=3, up to n=9.\n\nSo, for n=9, $a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}$.\n\nCompute $3^{10}$:\n\n$3^1 = 3$\n\n$3^2 = 9$\n\n$3^3 = 27$\n\n$3^4 = 81$\n\n$3^5 = 243$\n\n$3^6 = 729$\n\n$3^7 = 2187$\n\n$3^8 = 6561$\n\n$3^9 = 19683$\n\n$3^{10} = 59049$\n\nSo, $a_9 = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524$\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that my initial step-by-step calculation was correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, double-checked using a different method, and both approaches lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})\\). Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involves computing the current layer and substituting it into the next. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try to write it out more clearly so I can see what's going on. \n\nStarting from the innermost part: \n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\n2. Next, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3(4)). Let's compute that. First, compute the 3(4), which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So now, replacing that, the expression is: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))$\n\n3. Moving out another level, we have (1 + 3(13)). Let's compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So replacing that, the expression becomes: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))$\n\n4. Next, we have (1 + 3(40)). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Replacing that, the expression is now: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))$\n\n5. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(121)). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So now, the expression becomes: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))))$\n\n6. Next, we compute (1 + 3(364)). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Replacing that, the expression is: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))$\n\n7. Now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, the expression becomes: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))$\n\n8. Next, we compute (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Replacing that, the expression is now: \n$3(1 + 3(9841))$\n\n9. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, the expression becomes: \n$3(29524)$\n\n10. Finally, we compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 times 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 times 3 is 60000\n- 9000 times 3 is 27000\n- 500 times 3 is 1500\n- 20 times 3 is 60\n- 4 times 3 is 12\n\nAdding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 times 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should do it the standard way:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n   ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 x 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 x 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 x 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 x 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 x 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each time, we're taking the result from the innermost part and using it in the next layer. It's like a recursive process, where each step depends on the one before it. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, as far as I can tell. I even double-checked the final multiplication. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me write it down as I see it:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, it's 1+3. Then that result is multiplied by 3, and then added to 1 again, and so on. It looks like a recursive pattern where each step depends on the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing out each layer separately. So, the innermost part is:\n\n1. $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's:\n\n2. $1 + 3(4)$\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, let's define each layer as a step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as $a_n$, where n is the step number starting from the innermost. So:\n\n- $a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n- $a_2 = 1 + 3a_1$\n- $a_3 = 1 + 3a_2$\n- ...\n- And this goes on until $a_9$, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a separate layer, and each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer. Let's count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3.

Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first layer is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so counting the number of times \"1+3\" appears:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then the next layer is (1+3(...))\n- Repeating until the outermost.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1+3(...))\n\nLayer 2: 3(1+3(...))\n\nAnd so on. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around it. So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(...)) where ... is Layer 1\n\nLayer 3: (1+3(...)) where ... is Layer 2\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost is the first 3 multiplied by (1+3(...)), which is Layer 9. So, total of 9 layers. So, we have a1 to a9.\n\nWait, but actually, let's count the number of times \"1+3\" appears without being nested further. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+3\" is a separate term. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is (1+3*(previous layer)). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, starting with a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(a9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing a9, we need to multiply it by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, which is a1.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3*(a9). Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is a9.\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, which is a1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*a(n-1). So, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40\n\n...\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 29524\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*a9, because the outermost is 3*(a9). So, the total value is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(a9). So, yes, total is 3*a9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each step again.\n\nStarting with a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem has 9 layers of parentheses, right? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nYes, so a1 to a9, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, no, let's do it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nBut there's no more digits, so write down 27? Wait, no, the number is 29524, which is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the a9 calculation. Let's go back.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is 9 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units).\n\nSo:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen a9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar but nested inside the previous one. Maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parenthesis first and then moving outward. That sounds like a good plan.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the very last parenthesis: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parenthesis:\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, so that part is 4. Now, moving one step out, we have another parenthesis where this result is used. So the next layer is 1 + 3 times that 4. Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 4$\n\nWait, hold on, do I multiply before adding? Yes, according to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition. So, 3 times 4 is 12, then add 1.\n\n$1 + 12 = 13$\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 plus 3 times this 13. Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute the next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 13$\n\nAgain, multiplication first. 3 times 13 is 39. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 39 = 40$\n\nSo, that layer becomes 40. Let me keep going.\n\nStep 4: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 40$\n\nMultiplying first: 3 times 40 is 120. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 120 = 121$\n\nAlright, moving out another layer.\n\nStep 5: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 121$\n\nCalculating 3 times 121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 363 = 364$\n\nSo, that's 364. Next layer.\n\nStep 6: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 364$\n\nCalculating 3*364. Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me write down each result as I go:\n\n1. Innermost: 4\n2. Next: 13\n3. Next: 40\n4. Next: 121\n5. Next: 364\n6. Next: 1093\n\nWait, so now I have 1093. Let me check if I did that correctly. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then +1=1093. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nContinuing, moving out another layer.\n\nStep 7: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 1093$\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nSo, that layer is 3280. Next.\n\nStep 8: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 3280$\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nAlright, that's 9841. Next layer.\n\nStep 9: Next layer:\n$1 + 3 \\times 9841$\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Hmm, let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then add 1.\n\n$1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nWait, that seems correct. 3*9841 is indeed 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, which is the very first 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nStep 10: Compute the outermost layer:\n$3 \\times 29524$\n\nCalculating 3*29524. Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nWait, hold on, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524, which is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because that's a lot of steps. Maybe I should verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all steps check out. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(something). It seems like each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). This looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each step as a term in a sequence, where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might be faster than computing each step manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo,\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nOkay, so each term a_n can be calculated using this formula. Since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm: starting from the innermost as a_1, which is 4, then a_2=13, up to a_9.\n\nSo, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when I computed step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, 88,572 is the result.\n\nWait, let me just make sure that the formula is correctly applied. The formula was for a_n where n starts at 1 for the innermost. So, if there are 9 layers, n=9, which gives a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, so it's a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but offset by the +1 each time.\n\nBut in any case, both methods give me the same result, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested one, with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern: 3 times something, where that something is 1 plus another 3 times something else. So maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplying a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine layers in total. So I'll need to compute from the 9th layer up to the first layer. \n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. Starting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside the first parenthesis, it's 1 + 3(...). So each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis. So the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to number each layer starting from the innermost. Let me label each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. So starting from L9, which is (1 + 3). Then L8 is 3*(L9), then L7 is 1 + L8, and so on. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think.\n\nActually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is L1: (1 + 3). Then L2 is 3*(L1). Then L3 is 1 + L2. Then L4 is 3*(L3), and so on. Wait, maybe that's the correct way to think about it. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nSo let's start by computing the innermost part:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2: 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nNext, L3: 1 + L2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L4: 3*(L3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nL5: 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6: 3*(L5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nL7: 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL8: 3*(L7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nL9: 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL10: 3*(L9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer, right? Because each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so counting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). But in my earlier counting, I went up to L10, which might be incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nLet me parse the expression more carefully. The outermost layer is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). So each time, we have a 1 + 3*(next layer). So the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, we have 3*(4) = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), right? So the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(40) = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(121) = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, so that would be the total. So the final result is 1092. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting after the first 3, the expression is (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)). So each of these layers adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So as I computed earlier, the result is 1092. Let me verify this step by step again.\n\nLet me write down each layer clearly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3 * Layer1 = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3 * Layer3 = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3 * Layer5 = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3 * Layer7 = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * Layer9 = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the final answer should be 1092.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or check for any possible errors in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we're computing a term that's 1 + 3*(previous term). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nIf I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer2 was 3*Layer1 = 12, then Layer3 was 1 + 12 = 13. So a_2 would be 13, which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWhich matches my Layer5 as 40.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I had Layer1 as 4, Layer2 as 12, Layer3 as 13, Layer4 as 39, etc. So perhaps my initial approach was not correctly assigning the layers. Maybe I should think of each a_n as the result after n layers, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. If a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers leading to 364, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 1092. But according to this, a_5 is 364, and a_6 is 1093, which would be the result of 3*(364) + 1? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion arises because the outermost layer is 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). So in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), whereas the inner layers are 1 + 3*(...). So perhaps the total number of 1 + 3*(...) layers is 8, and then the outermost is 3*(result of those 8 layers).\n\nWait, let me recount the number of 1 + 3*(...) layers. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of such layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the original expression only has 9 layers, but the outermost is 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). So perhaps I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n3*( ... )\n\nwhere ... is:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So the number of layers where it's 1 + 3*(...) is 8, because the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer moving out adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count how many times this happens before the outermost 3*(...):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nWait, but that's a different result. Now I'm getting 29523. Hmm, so I must have miscounted the number of layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the outermost operation is 3*(...), and the inner part is 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So perhaps I need to compute 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nCompute 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I had 9 layers leading to 364 and then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. But that seems inconsistent with this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's even larger. Now I'm really confused because different counts give different results.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this more systematically. Let me write down each layer with their corresponding results.\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work my way out, numbering each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I initially thought there were 9 layers leading to 364, and then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, but now I'm getting 88572.\n\nI must be making a mistake in counting the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)):\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer moving out is another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the result is 88572. But earlier, I thought it was 1092. Clearly, I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to visualize the expression with the parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each ( corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...))\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), but the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the innermost is the 9th layer, and then we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), leading to the result before the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but that would mean that after computing the 9th layer, we have a result, say R9, and then the outermost is 3*R9.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, after 9 layers, R9 is 29524, so 3*R9 is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 9 layers, I only went up to R9 = 364, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and see what each layer evaluates to.\n\nLet me write down each layer clearly:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo according to this, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the answer was 1092, but that was when I thought there were only 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...). It seems I was miscounting the layers initially. Now, after carefully counting, it's clear that there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), leading to Layer9 = 29524, and then the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but in this smaller example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the expression has 3 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), but the outermost is 3*(...). So the number of layers where it's 1 + 3*(...) is 3, leading to Layer5 = 40, and then the outermost is 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is 3 layers of (1 + 3*(...)) inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in this case, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 3, leading to 40, then 3*40 = 120.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 9, leading to Layer9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought there were 9 layers leading to 364, which seems incorrect. It's clear now that the number of layers is 9, each adding another 1 + 3*(...), leading to Layer9 = 29524, then the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another smaller example to ensure my approach is correct.\n\nTake the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute this:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, the result is 39.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier approach, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 2, leading to Layer3 = 13, then 3*13 = 39. That matches.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 2, leading to 13, then 3*13 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 9, leading to 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the result was 1092. It's actually 88572.\n\nWait, but wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 12\n\nLayer3: 13\n\nLayer4: 39\n\nLayer5: 40\n\nLayer6: 120\n\nLayer7: 121\n\nLayer8: 363\n\nLayer9: 364\n\nThen, 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut that approach only accounted for 9 layers, but in reality, each layer after the first is 1 + 3*(previous), leading to more layers. So perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I was not correctly nesting the operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial approach was to compute each layer as 3*(previous result), but actually, each layer after the first is 1 + 3*(previous result). So perhaps I should model it as a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nLet me define a_n as the result after n layers, where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I only went up to a_5 = 364, then stopped, leading to an incorrect result. So the key is to recognize that there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), leading to a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to ensure I'm counting the layers correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first layer, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), up to 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(result of 9 layers).\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is as follows:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because earlier I thought it was 1092, but that was due to miscounting the layers. Let me try to compute it again step by step to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*4 = 12.\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. 3*13 = 39.\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. 3*40 = 120.\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. 3*121 = 363.\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but this approach only gives 10 layers, but according to the expression, there should be 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), leading to 29524 before the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers again. Let me try to parse the expression again, perhaps using a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that each time I see a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), it's a new layer. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the initial approach was to consider each 3*(...) as a layer, but in reality, the layers are the (1 + 3*(...)) parts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...).\n\nIn the original expression, starting from the innermost, how many times does the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occur?\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's count how many times this occurs before the outermost 3*(...):\n\nNumber of (1 + 3*(...)) layers: 9.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nWhich has 9 opening parentheses, indicating 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nTherefore, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), leading to:\n\nLayer1: 4.\n\nLayer2: 13.\n\nLayer3: 40.\n\nLayer4: 121.\n\nLayer5: 364.\n\nLayer6: 1"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested one, with each layer having a similar structure: 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). It seems like each time, there's a 1 added to a multiple of 3, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3 again. So, maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write out the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's 3 times that result. So, let me start by computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: (1 + result from step 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Next layer: 3*(result from step 3) = 3*13 = 39\n5. Next layer: (1 + result from step 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Next layer: 3*(result from step 5) = 3*40 = 120\n7. Next layer: (1 + result from step 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Next layer: 3*(result from step 7) = 3*121 = 363\n9. Next layer: (1 + result from step 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Next layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next layer: (1 + result from step 10) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Next layer: 3*(result from step 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next layer: (1 + result from step 12) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Next layer: 3*(result from step 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next layer: (1 + result from step 14) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems like a lot of steps, and I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that means there are nine layers after the initial 3. Wait, no, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, let me try again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of 3*(1+...): starting from the innermost, each step adds one more. Let me see: the innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each step is 3*(1+...). So, how many times do we have this 3*(1+...)?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is followed by a 3*(...).

(1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. The outermost 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me recount:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3), then multiplied by 3, and so on.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the innermost (1+3), how many times does this pattern repeat? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...) inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first ( after 3, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of the first inner expression: (1+3(...))\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( inside: 3(1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the ninth (.\n\nWait, no, actually, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1+...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. The outermost 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of times 3 is multiplied after the initial 3:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so that's the first multiplication.\n- Then, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to list each step with the correct number of layers.\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work outward, keeping track of each step.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me see: after the initial 3, the first ( starts a new layer, and each subsequent ( adds another. So, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each ( starts a new layer. So, that means there are 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 10 layers because I included the outermost 3*(1 + ...). Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me try again, carefully counting each layer.\n\n1. Start with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers. Let me check the structure again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with 9 layers. So, perhaps I'm including one extra layer. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the innermost (1+3), there are 8 more layers, making a total of 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, the first ( starts the first layer, and each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside: 3(1+3(\n3. Continuing until the ninth (.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside: 3(1+3(\n3. Continuing until the ninth (.\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 layers. So, each layer corresponds to a 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the computation should have 9 layers after the initial 3, making the total number of steps 10, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + 3(...)). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the number of layers inside the first (1 + ...) is 9. Therefore, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute this correctly, step by step, with 9 layers.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so the result of the innermost 9 layers is 29523. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 29523). Wait, no, because the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + ...). So, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... has 9 layers. So, after computing the inner 9 layers to get 29523, the next step is 3*(1 + 29523).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nWhere the innermost ... is (1 + 3). So, if there are 9 layers inside the first (1 + ...), then the computation would be:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nSo, the result of the inner 9 layers is 29523. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 29523). Wait, no, because the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + ...). Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the 9-layer computation. So, after computing the inner 9 layers to get 29523, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that would make it 10 layers. But the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, f(1) would be the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, that's not matching my earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define f(n) as the value after n layers. So, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, so f(9) is 88572, which would be the result after 9 layers. But in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n10. Finally, the outermost: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + ...). Therefore, the number of layers inside the first (1 + ...) is 9, leading to the result being 3*(1 + f(9)), where f(9) is the result after 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, f(9) was 29523, which would make the entire expression 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the original expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps f(9) is the result after 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + f(9)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, f(9) was 29523, which would be the result after 9 layers, so the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 3 is the first layer, and then there are 9 more layers, making it 10 layers in total. But that seems inconsistent with the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers.\n\nIn the original expression, how many times do we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...)? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is just 4.\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n- Then, 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n- And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n2. 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n3. 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n4. 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n5. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n6. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n7. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n8. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n9. 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost. Therefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 layers leading to 29523, and then the outermost layer being 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. Outermost layer: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, after 9 layers, the result is 29523, and then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, is the outermost layer included? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions is 9, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of 3*(1 + ...) from the innermost, it's 9, so the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 3 is the first layer, and then there are 8 more, making 9 layers in total, leading to 29523. But that contradicts the earlier counting.\n\nWait, no, the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + ...). So, the first (1 + ...) has 9 layers inside, leading to the result of 29523, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), with 9 layers inside the first (1 + ...).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step once more:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n4. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n5. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n6. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. After evaluating each nested expression, the final result is obtained.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Next Layer**: Multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.\n3. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12) = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39.\n4. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 39) = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120.\n5. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 120) = 3 \u00d7 121 = 363.\n6. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 363) = 3 \u00d7 364 = 1092.\n7. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1092) = 3 \u00d7 1093 = 3279.\n8. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 3279) = 3 \u00d7 3280 = 9840.\n9. **Next Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 9840) = 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29523.\n10. **Outermost Layer**: Add 1 and multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 29523) = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning there are multiple layers of parentheses, each containing similar terms. So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing that correctly. So, the innermost (1 + 3) is replaced by 4, so the next layer up becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute (1 + 3*4):\nFirst, 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13)))))))\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me correct that. The next layer is (1 + 3*(result of previous step)). So, since the previous step gave me 13, it's (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute (1 + 3*13):\n3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*40))))))\n\nWait, no, again, I think I might be misplacing the parentheses. Let me try to write this step by step, layer by layer.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, maybe? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. \n\nLooking at the original expression: There are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\n3 * 524 = 1572\n\nSo, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers, let me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. So, I think I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to think about it differently, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, so that's exactly what I did earlier. So, computing each term step by step is the way to go here. There's no shortcut formula that I can think of for this particular recurrence, since it's a linear recurrence but with a constant term. The general solution for such a recurrence would involve finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nWait, maybe I can solve the recurrence relation more formally. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved some time, but since I was doing it step by step, it worked out fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each time it's 3*previous + 1. So, yeah, that's the same as the recurrence.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to parse this.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the first expression I see is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that with another (1 + 3*(...)). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.

Wait, actually, looking at the problem, the outermost multiplication by 3 is on the entire expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). So maybe I should consider that as the outermost layer.

Let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\nSo, 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from step 9). So, step 10: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check that multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 7 7 7 5 7 2, but wait, that seems off. Let me do it properly:\n\nWait, 29524\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to miscalculate somewhere.\n\nStarting from step 1:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step, to see if it matches.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous result). That looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence, or find the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, the result is confirmed to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
