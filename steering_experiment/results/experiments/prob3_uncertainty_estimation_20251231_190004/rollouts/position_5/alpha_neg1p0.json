    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify this without having to compute each step individually. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is equal to 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I get the order right. It's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So now, the next layer out is 13. Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, interesting. So, the next layer is 40. \n\nWait a second, let me check that. 3 times 13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that layer is 121.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's a bigger number, but okay, moving on.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's see, 3 times 1093 is... let me compute that. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that layer is 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that layer is 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate that. 3 times 9841: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that layer is 29524.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3 times 29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that layer is 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me double-check that. 3 times 29524: 29524 times 3. Let me compute it digit by digit to make sure.\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 times 3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, it's 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3 times 88573: 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that layer is 265720.\n\nWait, that seems like a huge number. Let me verify that. 88573 times 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those: 240000 +24000=264000; 264000+1500=265500; 265500+210=265710; 265710+9=265719. Then, 265719 +1=265720. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that. 3 times 265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 +180000=780000; 780000 +15000=795000; 795000 +2100=797100; 797100 +60=797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. So, that layer is 797161.\n\nWait, hold on, that's a massive number. Let me make sure I did that correctly. 265720 times 3: 200000*3=600000; 60000*3=180000; 5000*3=15000; 700*3=2100; 20*3=60. So, adding those: 600000+180000=780000; 780000+15000=795000; 795000+2100=797100; 797100+60=797160. Then, 797160 +1=797161. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, the expression is 3 times that result. So, it's 3*(797161). Let me compute that. 700000*3=2100000; 90000*3=270000; 7000*3=21000; 100*3=300; 60*3=180; 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 +270000=2370000; 2370000 +21000=2391000; 2391000 +300=2391300; 2391300 +180=2391480; 2391480 +3=2391483.\n\nWait, let me verify that step-by-step. 797161 times 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2.\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2.\nNothing left, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 797161 * 3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2.\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2.\nNow, there are no more digits, so we write down the carry over 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 3, 8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 9, 3, 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 2391384? Wait, let me write it down:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1: 3\n6: 8\n1: 4\n7:1\n9:9\n7:3\n9:9\n7:3\nAnd the carryover:2\n\nSo, reading from left to right: 2,3,9,1,3,8,4,3,9,3? Wait, that seems confused.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the order. Let me try again, writing down each digit step by step.\n\nNumber: 797161\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n1: 1*3=3\n6: 6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1: 1*3=3 +1=4\n7: 7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9: 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7: 7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\n9: 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7: 7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\nNow, since we're at the leftmost digit, write down the carry over 2.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 2,3,9,1,3,8,4,3,9,3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 797161 is a 6-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 7-digit number. Let me count: 2,3,9,1,3,8,4,3,9,3. That's 10 digits, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the digits as I compute them, from right to left, and then reverse them at the end.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3 (units place)\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1 (tens place)\n1*3=3 +1=4 (hundreds place)\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2 (thousands place)\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2 (ten thousands place)\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2 (hundred thousands place)\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2 (millions place)\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2 (ten millions place)\nNow, write down the carry over 2 (hundred millions place)\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are: 3,8,4,1,9,3,9,3,2. Wait, that's 9 digits, but 797161 is 6 digits, so 797161*3 should be a 7-digit number. So, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me list the number: 7 9 7 1 6 1.\n\nSo, 6 digits. Multiplying by 3, the result should be up to 7 digits.\n\nLet me write down the multiplication step by step:\n\n      7 9 7 1 6 1\n    x          3\n    -------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the carry over 2.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 3,8,4,1,9,3,2.\n\nWait, that's 7 digits: 2,3,9,1,4,8,3.\n\nWait, no, when writing from right to left, the first digit is units, then tens, etc. So, the result should be read from left to right as 2,3,9,1,4,8,3. Wait, that would be 2391483.\n\nWait, that's 2,391,483. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nCompute 797,161 * 3:\n\n700,000 *3=2,100,000\n\n90,000 *3=270,000\n\n7,000 *3=21,000\n\n100 *3=300\n\n60 *3=180\n\n1 *3=3\n\nAdding those together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 +21,000=2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 +300=2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 +180=2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 +3=2,391,483\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 797,161 *3=2,391,483.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait a minute, let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that's a lot of computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 +3=4\n\nThen, 1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nThen, 1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nThen, 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nThen, 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nThen, 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nThen, 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573\n\nThen, 1 +3*88573=1 +265719=265720\n\nThen, 1 +3*265720=1 +797160=797161\n\nFinally, 3*797161=2,391,483.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and each multiplication and addition seems correct upon verification.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 2,391,483.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{2391483}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue outward with the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Next layer:\n    \\[\n    1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n    \\]\n\n11. Next layer:\n    \\[\n    1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n    \\]\n\n12. Next layer:\n    \\[\n    1 + 3 \\times 265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n    \\]\n\n13. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 797161 = 2391483\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{2391483}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a nested set of additions and multiplications. Each part inside the parentheses is 1 plus 3 times something. Since it's nested so many times, maybe the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with 1 plus 3 times the result of the next parentheses. That seems repetitive, so perhaps there's a pattern or a recursive formula I can use here.\n\nLet me assign each level a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3\n- Then the next one out would be E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n- Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n- And so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression.\n\nSo, each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E1. That seems manageable. Let me compute each E(n) step by step.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. But the original expression is 3 times E9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is E9. So, the total value would be 3*E9.\n\nSo, E9 is 29524, so the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 9, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check my calculations for E1 to E9 because that's where the complexity is. Maybe I made a mistake in one of those steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. So, E9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nHmm, seems solid. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the E(n) variables, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1+3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nAnd finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYep, same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, it's more of a recursively defined sequence. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), which has the solution E(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nE_p = 1 + 3*E_p\n\nSolving for E_p:\n\nE_p - 3*E_p = 1 => -2*E_p = 1 => E_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, E(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So, E(9)=29524, then the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered multiple approaches: iterative step-by-step computation, defining a recursive sequence, solving the recurrence relation, and verifying each step. All methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and substituting it into the next level. \n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - E\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Substitute E\u2081 into the next level:\n   - E\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Continue this process up to the ninth level:\n   - E\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a nested series of additions and multiplications by 3. It starts with 3 times something, and that something is (1 + 3 times another similar expression). It seems like each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how nested expressions work.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3 times that result). So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nWait, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1 to the next layer. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait a second, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, I should have 9 steps of computing each layer. Let me recount:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps, let me go through the layers again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after 9 such operations, starting from 4, I get 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. \n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer was (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. \n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a non-homogeneous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\n1 = C*3^0 - 1/2\n1 = C*1 - 1/2\nC = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems like a formula we can use. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's our first layer.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, that's the second layer.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous) +1. The original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so n=9.\n\nThus, the innermost expression after 9 layers is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down layer by layer:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter evaluating all layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of the problem. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the previous one. That makes me think I should probably solve it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That's usually how you handle parentheses, right? Start with the innermost and move outward.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, if I count the number of opening parentheses, I can see how many layers there are. Let me count: starting from the left, each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let's see, the first layer is 3(1 + ...), then inside that is another 3(1 + ...), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3s at the beginning of each parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 3(1+3(...)), and each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 3(1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers of 3(...). Wait, actually, let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\": 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers. That means I have to compute from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and work my way out to the first layer.\n\nSo, let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the next layer). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution.\n\nLet me number the layers from innermost to outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, Layer 1 would be the innermost, and Layer 9 would be the outermost. So, I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The innermost parentheses is the last one: 1 + 3. So, that's Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. Layer 2: 3*(1 + result of Layer 1). Then Layer 3: 3*(1 + result of Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the structure is such that each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I should start from the innermost and work outward, each time computing the value of each layer based on the next one.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n- Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n- Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n- Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n- Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n- Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n- Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n- Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the layer numbering. Let me go back to the original expression:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, Layer 9 would be the outermost, so the final result is 36084. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me go step by step again, maybe using a table to keep track.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 3*(1 + 4)   | 15\n3    | 3*(1 + 15)  | 48\n4    | 3*(1 + 48)  | 147\n5    | 3*(1 + 147) | 444\n6    | 3*(1 + 444) | 1335\n7    | 3*(1 + 1335)| 4008\n8    | 3*(1 + 4008)| 12027\n9    | 3*(1 + 12027)|36084\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. Hmm, 49*3 is 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; so 300+120=420, +24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; 1200+120=1320, +15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute this. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s at the beginning: Let's see, starting from the left, each time we have 3 followed by (1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"(\":\n\n- The first \"(\" after the first 3 is Layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another \"(\" is Layer 2.\n- Continuing this way, up to Layer 9.\n\nYes, so there are 9 layers of parentheses, meaning we compute from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time using the result from the inner layer. So, my earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some pattern, but given that it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation seems manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each next layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting with a1 = 4, then a2 = 3*(1 + a1), a3 = 3*(1 + a2), and so on up to a9.\n\nBut, in any case, the step-by-step computation seems to give me 36084 as the final result.\n\nLet me just verify each step once more to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different method or checking the arithmetic in a different way.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16. Let's compute 16*3: 10*3=30, 6*3=18; 30+18=48.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That makes sense because with all those parentheses, I should solve the innermost one first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 * 4 = 12. \n\nWait, but then that 12 is inside another parentheses, right? So, the next level up is (1 + 12). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nNow, moving out another level, we have 3 times 13. Let me calculate that: 3 * 13 = 39. \n\nGoing up another level, the next expression is (1 + 39). Let me add those: 1 + 39 = 40. \n\nNext, moving out, we have 3 times 40. Calculating that: 3 * 40 = 120. \n\nMoving up another level, we have (1 + 120). Adding those together: 1 + 120 = 121. \n\nContinuing outward, the next step is 3 times 121. Let me compute that: 3 * 121. Hmm, 120 * 3 is 360, and 1 * 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. \n\nNow, moving up, the next expression is (1 + 363). Adding those: 1 + 363 = 364. \n\nNext, 3 times 364. Let me figure that out. 300 * 3 is 900, 60 * 3 is 180, and 4 * 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. \n\nMoving up another level, we have (1 + 1092). That's straightforward: 1 + 1092 = 1093. \n\nThen, 3 times 1093. Let's compute that. 1000 * 3 is 3000, 90 * 3 is 270, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. \n\nNext, moving up, we have (1 + 3279). That's 1 + 3279 = 3280. \n\nThen, 3 times 3280. Let me calculate that. 3000 * 3 is 9000, 200 * 3 is 600, and 80 * 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. \n\nMoving up another level, we have (1 + 9840). That's 1 + 9840 = 9841. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times 9841. Let me compute that. 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. \n\nWait, let me double-check that last multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 9841 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step involved computing the innermost parentheses, moving outward, and multiplying by 3 each time. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down step by step, I was able to compute each part without getting lost.\n\nLet me just recap the steps I took:\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next parentheses: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next parentheses: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next parentheses: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next parentheses: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next parentheses: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next parentheses: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next parentheses: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nSo, each time, I took the result from the innermost parentheses, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and repeated this process until I reached the outermost layer. It's like peeling an onion, layer by layer, each time computing the current value before moving outward.\n\nI think the key here was to not get overwhelmed by the number of parentheses but instead tackle each one step by step. It's easy to get lost if I tried to compute everything at once, but by focusing on one small part each time, it became manageable.\n\nLet me also think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each step manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, if I denote each step as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3, a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on. So, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. \n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can express a_n in a closed-form formula. Let me try to recall how to solve linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A * 3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3C + 1\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A * 3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A * 3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2\n3A = 9/2\nA = (9/2) / 3\nA = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, if I can express the number of terms here, I might have been able to compute the result more quickly. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. \n\nLooking back at the original expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Wait, let me count:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(result) + 1\n3. 3*(result) + 1\n...\nUp to 9 times?\n\nWait, actually, when I broke it down earlier, I had 16 steps, but maybe that's because I was writing each multiplication and addition separately. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the structure: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the entire expression has 9 such layers because starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of terms n is 9.\n\nWait, actually, in the expression, the number of multiplications by 3 is 9, which would correspond to n=9 in the recurrence. So, using the closed-form solution, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Since a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = 59049 / 2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 29523. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the closed-form solution?\n\nWait, let's go back. The initial condition was a1 = 4, right? Because the innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4. So, in the recurrence, a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3a1, etc. So, if I have 9 layers, that would correspond to a9.\n\nBut according to the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1 should be (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches my earlier computation where after the first multiplication, I had 12, then 1 + 12 =13.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nBut wait, when I computed manually, I ended up with 29523. That's a problem because the two methods should give the same result. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check my manual computation again, step by step.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so in the manual computation, I ended up with 29523, but the closed-form formula gave me 29524. That's a difference of 1. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is different. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(...) +1\n3. 3*(...) +1\n...\nLet me count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each time we have another (1 + 3(...))\n- Let's count how many opening parentheses there are before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me parse the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). The innermost part is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers after the first 3(...). Hmm, no, actually, the expression is 3*(...), where the ... has 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)), because starting from the innermost, each time we have another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3*(...). So, actually, the number of layers is 9, meaning n=9 in the recurrence.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a9 = 29524, but my manual computation gave 29523. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, n=9, which would give a9=29524 according to the formula. But my manual computation gave 29523. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check my manual computation again. Maybe I missed a step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so that's 16 steps, but according to the recurrence, it should be 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps the confusion is in how we're counting the layers.\n\nWait, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) is the next layer.\n\nSo, in the manual computation, we have:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but in my manual computation, I stopped at 3*9841=29523, which is the outermost layer. So, perhaps in the formula, a9 is the result after 9 layers, which is 29524, but in the manual computation, I computed up to 3*9841, which is the 9th multiplication, but perhaps the formula counts the layers differently.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the recurrence, a1 = 4, which is the innermost. Then, a2 = 13, which is the next layer. So, a9 would be the result after 9 layers, which would be the outermost layer before multiplying by the final 3.\n\nWait, no, the outermost operation is 3*(a9). So, the total expression is 3*a9, where a9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, in the formula, a9 = 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But that's not matching my manual computation.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested expression with 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the total number of layers is 9 inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in the recurrence, a1 = 4, a2 = 13, ..., a9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation, I computed 3*(...), where ... ended up as 9841, which gave me 29523. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the manual computation.\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 3*4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13 (Layer 2)\n4. 3*13 = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40 (Layer 3)\n6. 3*40 = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121 (Layer 4)\n8. 3*121 = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364 (Layer 5)\n10. 3*364 = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n12. 3*1093 = 3279\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n14. 3*3280 = 9840\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n16. 3*9841 = 29523 (Layer 9)\n\nWait, so in the manual computation, I have 9 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, the 9th layer is (1 + 3*9840) = 9841, and then the outermost multiplication is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a9 = 29524, which would be the result of the 9th layer, i.e., (1 + 3*a8). So, a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9840 = 1 + 29520 = 29521. Wait, that's not matching my manual computation.\n\nWait, in my manual computation, after layer 8, I had 9841, which is (1 + 3*3280). So, a8 = 9841. Then, a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, a9 = 29524.\n\nBut in my manual computation, I stopped at 3*a8 = 3*9841 = 29523, which is the total expression. So, the total expression is 3*a8, not 3*a9.\n\nWait, so in the formula, a9 = 29524, but the total expression is 3*a8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, the confusion arises because in the formula, a_n is the value after n layers, which is (1 + 3*a_{n-1}), but the total expression is 3*a9, where a9 is the value after 9 layers.\n\nWait, no, let me parse the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's 3 multiplied by the result of the nested expression. The nested expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the nested expression is a9, which is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation, I computed the nested expression as 9841, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. That suggests that I only computed 8 layers, not 9.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers in the manual computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the nested expression is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation earlier, I stopped at 3*9841 = 29523, which is the outermost multiplication, but that would only be 8 layers. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, looking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many (1 + 3(...)) expressions are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a separate layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the nested expression has 9 layers, meaning a9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation earlier, I only computed up to 3*9841 = 29523, which suggests I only computed 8 layers. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me write out the layers again:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the nested expression is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier manual computation, I stopped at 3*9841 = 29523, which is the result after 8 layers, not 9. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, looking back at the original expression, the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions is 9, so the nested expression has 9 layers, and the total expression is 3 times that. So, the correct result should be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier manual computation where I ended up with 29523. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the manual computation step by step, carefully:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next layer: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next layer: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next layer: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so that's 16 steps, but according to the recurrence, after 9 layers, we should have 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation, I only reached 29523, which is 3*9841, where 9841 is the result after 8 layers.\n\nSo, the confusion is that the original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so the nested expression is a9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my manual computation, I only computed 8 layers, resulting in 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me try to compute all 9 layers manually:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = "

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding what's going on here. It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute it from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3* something. Let me see: the innermost part is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers in total. Wait, actually, let me check again. The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(... So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(... So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(... parts. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is nested inside. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(... segments. Let's see: starting from the outermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ... So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), and so on. So, how many layers is that? Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...). \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let me write down each step as I compute each layer, starting from the innermost one.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\n3*88573: Let's compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(previous result). So, 3*265720.\n\nCompute that: 200000*3=600000, 65720*3. Let me compute 65720*3: 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 180000 +15000=195000, +2100=197100, +60=197160. Then 600000 + 197160 = 797160.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back and check each step to see if I made a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\n12. Finally, outermost: 3*265720 = 797160. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*265720 again.\n\n3*200,000 = 600,000\n\n3*60,000 = 180,000\n\n3*5,000 = 15,000\n\n3*700 = 2,100\n\n3*20 = 60\n\nWait, 265,720 is 200,000 + 60,000 + 5,000 + 700 + 20.\n\nSo 3*265,720 = 600,000 + 180,000 + 15,000 + 2,100 + 60.\n\nAdding up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted the layers correctly because 797,160 seems quite large, and sometimes with these nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each 3(1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count how many 3(1+3(...) there are. Starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) - that's the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ... So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) in the expression.\n\nWait, the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, a new 3(1+3(...) is added. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(... starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me see: starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each time we go out, it's layer 2, 3, etc. So, if I have 9 layers, then I should have 9 computations. But in my earlier computation, I had 11 steps, which suggests 11 layers, but that can't be right because the expression only has 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try again. Let's parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ... So, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, now I'm getting 88,572 as the final result, which is much lower than 797,160. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each 3*(1 + ... adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... after the initial 3*(.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer1)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer9)\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's only 9 layers, which means I had an extra two layers in my initial calculation, which led me to the incorrect result of 797,160. So, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times would lead to a much smaller number than 797,160. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were 11 layers instead of 9.\n\nWait, let me check the expression again to make sure I'm not miscounting.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent 3*(1 + ... is a new layer. Let me count how many 3*(1 + ... there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers, leading to 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 3*(Layer11), which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, outermost: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but when I first started, I thought there were more. I need to make sure I'm correctly counting the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3( after the first one.\n\nLooking at the expression: after the first 3(, there are 8 more 3(, but wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times \"3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. So, the number of 3( after the first one is 8, making it 9 layers in total. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but that was a mistake. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't misread it.\n\nProblem: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nYes, that's nine layers of 3*(1 + ... So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's solve it:\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result we got earlier by step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested multiplications and additions. It starts with 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by another similar expression), and this pattern continues several times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, I see 1+3, and then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So the innermost part is 1+3, right? Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n1. Compute 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, that result is multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each level is 3 times (1 plus the next level). So maybe I should work from the inside out, computing each level step by step.\n\nLet me write down each level as I go:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is each time 1 plus 3 times the previous level. Let me see:\n\nWait, the problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many levels there are. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and this happens multiple times. Let me count the number of 1+3 parts.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3*(1+3))\n3. Next: (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, but how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, each step is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 sections. Let's see: from the innermost, there are 9 instances of 1+3, each time multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next level. Wait, no, perhaps it's 8 levels. Wait, maybe I should count the number of times 1+3 is used.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier if I start computing from the inside and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign each level a number, starting from the innermost as level 1, then level 2, up to level 9, since I can see that there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time we go one level out, it's 1 + 3*(previous level). So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), right? Because the outermost is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)) which is Level 9.\n\nSo, final result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the levels correctly because that seems like a lot of computation. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the levels.\n\nLet me go through each level again to make sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 *29524=88572.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me check how many levels there are. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). From the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first level. Then each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1.\n\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 Level 2.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 Level 3.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we add another level. So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before each 1+3.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and each time we go out, it's 1+3*(...). So, let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many 1+3 sections are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new level. Let's count how many times we have 1+3:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen, each time we go out, another 1+3. So, the number of 1+3 is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, each step adds another 1+3. So, 9 levels.\n\nWait, but when I computed Level 9 as 29524, that would be the result of the innermost 1+3 through 9 levels, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each level manually, because if I have to compute 9 levels, that's time-consuming, and I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, so each level is defined as Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, starting from Level 1 = 4, Level 2=13, Level3=40, etc.\n\nI notice that each Level n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me think about this.\n\nWait, so Level 1: 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLevel4: 1 +3*40=121.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation: Level n = 1 + 3*Level(n-1), with Level 1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Level n - 3*Level(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is Level_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Level_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A =1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level(n) = Level_h(n) + Level_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: Level(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is Level(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: Level(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Level(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level(9)) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, Level(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12 \u21922, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Level(9) again using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nLevel(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nBut in this case, since each level is 1 +3*previous_level, it's similar to a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nWait, but using the formula we derived earlier, it's easier.\n\nSo, after computing all levels up to Level 9, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of levels. Since the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, so:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3*(1+3))\n\n3. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n4. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n5. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n\n6. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n\n7. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))\n\n8. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\n9. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 levels of 1+3, each multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next level. So, Level 9 is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9).\n\nThus, the computation seems correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost level:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next level:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part of the expression because that seems like the logical place to begin. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So, let me write that down: 1 + 3. That's easy enough, that equals 4. So, replacing that innermost part with 4, the expression becomes a bit shorter. Let me see:\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I should work my way outwards step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression properly. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. From the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and then each of those is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each step outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of times we have a 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first opening parenthesis after 3 is for the first 1+3.\n2. Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, so from the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, that means there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). Hmm, that seems a bit too many. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is for 1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses. So, that means we have 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working our way outwards.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I thought the innermost was 1+3, which would be the 9th layer, but actually, each layer is 1+3*(next layer). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1+3, then the 8th layer is 1+3*(9th layer), and so on, until the first layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value of each layer and substituting it into the next.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from innermost to outermost as layer 1 to layer 9.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is the first one we compute, so maybe layer 1 is the innermost, layer 2 is the next one out, up to layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let's start.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nWait, this seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, it's a recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find D.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant D. So, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D =1\n\n-2D=1 => D= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula.\n\nSince a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, the value is 3*a_9=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, and it confirms the answer.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time computing the value of the current layer and substituting it into the next. Using the recursive relation and solving it, we find the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So let me count how many layers there are here. Each time I see a \"1+3\", that's one layer, and then each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to the next layer. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to see it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I can see that there are nine layers here, each starting with \"1 + 3\". Let me start from the innermost one and work my way out. So the innermost part is \"1 + 3\". Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one. Maybe I can write down each step so I don't get lost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when you do a lot of multiplication and addition, it's easy to slip up.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 3*9841. Let's break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer checks out. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let me break this down:\n\n30000*3 = 90000\n\nBut wait, 29524 is less than 30000. So, 29524*3.\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I end up with 88572 as the result.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression had nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", right? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each \"1 + 3\":\n\n1: (1 + 3(...\n\n2: (1 + 3(...\n\n3: (1 + 3(...\n\n4: (1 + 3(...\n\n5: (1 + 3(...\n\n6: (1 + 3(...\n\n7: (1 + 3(...\n\n8: (1 + 3(...\n\n9: (1 + 3(...\n\nAnd then the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. So yes, 9 layers, each corresponding to Layers 1 through 9 as I computed earlier. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just try another way to compute the innermost layers to see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recursive formula, I get the same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating each layer from the innermost one:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses where each one is multiplied by 3. It seems like each step involves computing the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Let me try to parse this structure.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking closer, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 1 plus 3 times that, and so on. So, maybe I can represent each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me try to write this out.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost part as A\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081. Then A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082, and so on, until A\u2089, since there are nine layers in total. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we add another 1+3(...) until we have nine layers. Wait, no, actually, each time we have a 1+3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then, the next one is 1+3*(previous), so that's two layers, and so on, until the outermost layer is the ninth. So, A\u2081 is (1+3), A\u2082 is 1+3*A\u2081, up to A\u2089, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the problem, it's 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, the outermost layer is 3*(A\u2089), where A\u2089 is 1 + 3*A\u2088, and so on. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me list the layers as A\u2081 through A\u2089, where each A\u2096 is defined as 1 + 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081, except for A\u2081, which is just 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, A\u2081 would be the innermost, so A\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082, and so on until A\u2089, and then the total expression is 3*A\u2089.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, the inner expression is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's A\u2082 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's A\u2083 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's go on. A\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. So adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because each step seems to be growing rapidly, which might be correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So A\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So A\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So A\u2089 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29,524. Let's compute that:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors because each step depends on the previous one, and a small mistake could throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me verify each A\u2096 again:\n\nA\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2086: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1,080 + 12 = 1,092. So 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2087: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093:\n\n1,000*3=3,000\n\n90*3=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding: 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279\n\nSo, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2088: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3:\n\n3,000*3=9,000\n\n280*3=840\n\nSo, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840\n\n1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2089: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,841*3:\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524:\n\n29,524*3: Let's compute 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.\n\nAdding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29,524 another way to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 7, 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 is a 5-digit number, so let me write it properly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each step is 1 + 3*previous, so it's a geometric series? Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. Let me see.\n\nThe general form is A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a geometric sequence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A\u2099 = C*(3)\u207f, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to find the closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition A\u2081 = 4: 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, A\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n = 9 because we have nine layers. So, A\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, A\u2089 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also get 88,572, which confirms our step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward. Let's define each layer as \\( A_k \\) where \\( A_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer \\( A_{k} = 1 + 3A_{k-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   A_2 = 1 + 3A_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a series of nested parentheses where each inner expression is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the result of the inner expression. \n\nSince there are multiple layers, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each step without getting confused by the nesting. Let me count how many layers there are. \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, let's see. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and each closing one closes it. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of times this happens. \n\nWait, maybe I should just count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: \n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so inside that, there's another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. \n\nI think there are 9 layers here because I see 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3. Let me check: \n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(... \n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So I need to compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. Let's start.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\n**Step 2: Move one layer out**\n\nNow, the next layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), where the ... is now 4 from the previous step. So let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute inside the parentheses: 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the inner part is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So in this case, the innermost result is 4, so it's 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, but hold on, is it 1 + 3*4 or 3*(1 + 4)? Let me make sure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(inner)). So yes, it's 3*(1 + 3*(inner)). So if the inner is 4, then it's 3*(1 + 3*4).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let's parse it correctly. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(inner)), so the inner is 4. So the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4). \n\nWait, but hold on, is it 3*(1 + (3*4)) or 3*(1 + 3*(inner))? I think it's the latter. So it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)). \n\nSo first, compute 3*4 = 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13, then multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. \n\nNo, actually, wait. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(inner)). So inner is 4, so 3*(inner) is 3*4=12. Then 1 + 12=13, then 3*13=39. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(39))))))))\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm replacing correctly. The original expression after the first step was:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nSo after computing the innermost (1+3)=4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4). So that's 3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. So that layer becomes 39. So the next layer out is now:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(39))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because after computing the innermost, we have 3*(1 + 3*(4))=39, so that entire layer is replaced by 39. So the next layer up is 3*(1 + 3*(39)). \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer9)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) \n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me compute Layer7.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*(39)) \n\nFirst compute 3*39: 3*39=117\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 117=118\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*118=354\n\nSo Layer7=354\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check.\n\nLayer8=39\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(1 + 117)=3*118=354\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to Layer6:\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer7))=3*(1 + 3*354)\n\nCompute 3*354: 3*354=1062\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1062=1063\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*1063=3189\n\nSo Layer6=3189\n\nWait, that's a big number. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to make this easier, instead of computing each layer manually. Because doing this step by step might take a while and could be error-prone.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). So if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 3*L_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13=39\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 3*L_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39)=3*118=354\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 3*L_3)=3*(1 + 3*354)=3*1063=3189\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 3*L_4)=3*(1 + 3*3189)=3*(1 + 9567)=3*9568=28704\n\nWait, hold on, 3*3189 is 9567, right? Because 3000*3=9000, 189*3=567, so 9000+567=9567. Then 1 + 9567=9568, then 3*9568=28704.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 3*L_5)=3*(1 + 3*28704)=3*(1 + 86112)=3*86113=258339\n\nWait, 3*28704=86112, then 1 + 86112=86113, then 3*86113=258339.\n\nYes.\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 3*L_6)=3*(1 + 3*258339)=3*(1 + 775017)=3*775018=2325054\n\nWait, 3*258339=775017, then 1 + 775017=775018, then 3*775018=2325054.\n\nYes.\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 3*L_7)=3*(1 + 3*2325054)=3*(1 + 6975162)=3*6975163=20925489\n\nWait, 3*2325054=6975162, then 1 + 6975162=6975163, then 3*6975163=20925489.\n\nYes.\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 3*L_8)=3*(1 + 3*20925489)=3*(1 + 62776467)=3*62776468=188329404\n\nWait, 3*20925489=62776467, then 1 + 62776467=62776468, then 3*62776468=188329404.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are getting really large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nLet me verify L_2 to L_3:\n\nL_2=39\n\nL_3=3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(1 + 117)=3*118=354. Correct.\n\nL_4=3*(1 + 3*354)=3*(1 + 1062)=3*1063=3189. Correct.\n\nL_5=3*(1 + 3*3189)=3*(1 + 9567)=3*9568=28704. Correct.\n\nL_6=3*(1 + 3*28704)=3*(1 + 86112)=3*86113=258339. Correct.\n\nL_7=3*(1 + 3*258339)=3*(1 + 775017)=3*775018=2325054. Correct.\n\nL_8=3*(1 + 3*2325054)=3*(1 + 6975162)=3*6975163=20925489. Correct.\n\nL_9=3*(1 + 3*20925489)=3*(1 + 62776467)=3*62776468=188329404. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWhich is a geometric series multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1 before being multiplied by 3 again.\n\nAlternatively, let's denote the entire expression as S. Then S can be written as:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3)))\n\nBut since there are 9 layers, it's a finite nested expression. So maybe we can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few layers and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nLayer1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39\n\nLayer3: L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2)=3*(1 + 117)=3*118=354\n\nLayer4: L4=3*(1 + 3*L3)=3*(1 + 1062)=3*1063=3189\n\nLayer5: L5=3*(1 + 3*L4)=3*(1 + 9567)=3*9568=28704\n\nLayer6: L6=3*(1 + 3*L5)=3*(1 + 86112)=3*86113=258339\n\nLayer7: L7=3*(1 + 3*L6)=3*(1 + 775017)=3*775018=2325054\n\nLayer8: L8=3*(1 + 3*L7)=3*(1 + 6975162)=3*6975163=20925489\n\nLayer9: L9=3*(1 + 3*L8)=3*(1 + 62776467)=3*62776468=188329404\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 39, 354, 3189, 28704, 258339, 2325054, 20925489, 188329404.\n\nI notice that each term is approximately 3 times the previous term, but not exactly because each time we add 1 before multiplying by 3. So it's like each term is 3*(previous term*3 +1).\n\nWait, let me express it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nThen, L_1 = 4\n\nFor n >1, L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1})\n\nSo, L_n = 3 + 9*L_{n-1}\n\nWait, because 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1})=3*1 + 3*3*L_{n-1}=3 +9*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is L_n = 9*L_{n-1} +3\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*9^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, let's assume the solution is constant, i.e., L_n = C for all n.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 9*C +3\n\nC -9C=3\n\n-8C=3\n\nC= -3/8\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*9^n -3/8\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. For n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*9^1 -3/8\n\n4 = 9A - 3/8\n\nAdd 3/8 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/8 =9A\n\nConvert 4 to eighths: 32/8 +3/8=35/8=9A\n\nSo, A=35/(8*9)=35/72\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n= (35/72)*9^n -3/8\n\nSimplify:\n\nNote that 9^n = (9)^n, so:\n\nL_n=35/72 *9^n -3/8\n\nWe can write 35/72 as 35/(8*9)=35/72\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/8:\n\nL_n= (35/9 *9^{n-1}) -3/8\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just compute it as is.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is our case, L_9= (35/72)*9^9 -3/8\n\nBut 9^9 is a huge number, and 35/72 is a fraction, so it's not very helpful for computation, but it's good to know the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already computed L_9 step by step as 188,329,404, and that seems consistent, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if 35/72 *9^9 -3/8 equals 188,329,404.\n\nCompute 9^9 first.\n\n9^1=9\n\n9^2=81\n\n9^3=729\n\n9^4=6561\n\n9^5=59049\n\n9^6=531441\n\n9^7=4782969\n\n9^8=43046721\n\n9^9=387420489\n\nSo, 9^9=387,420,489\n\nNow, compute 35/72 *387,420,489\n\nFirst, compute 387,420,489 /72\n\n387,420,489 \u00f772:\n\nLet me compute 387,420,489 \u00f772.\n\n72*5,000,000=360,000,000\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 -360,000,000=27,420,489\n\nNow, 72*380,000=27,360,000\n\nSubtract:27,420,489 -27,360,000=60,489\n\nNow, 72*839=60,489 (because 72*800=57,600, 72*39=2,808; 57,600+2,808=60,408. Wait, that's 60,408, which is 81 less than 60,489. So 72*839=60,408, and 60,489-60,408=81, which is 72*1.125, but that's not an integer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 72*839=72*(800+39)=72*800=57,600 +72*39=2,808= total 57,600+2,808=60,408.\n\nThen, 60,489-60,408=81, which is 72*1.125, but since we need integer division, it's 839 with a remainder of 81.\n\nSo total is 5,000,000 +380,000 +839=5,380,839 with a remainder of 81.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 /72=5,380,839 with a remainder of 81, which is 5,380,839 +81/72=5,380,839 +1.125=5,380,840.125\n\nBut since we're multiplying by 35, let's compute:\n\n35*(5,380,839 +81/72)=35*5,380,839 +35*(81/72)\n\n35*5,380,839=?\n\nWell, 5,380,839 *35:\n\nFirst, 5,380,839 *30=161,425,170\n\nThen, 5,380,839 *5=26,904,195\n\nAdd them together:161,425,170 +26,904,195=188,329,365\n\nNow, compute 35*(81/72)=35*(9/8)=315/8=39.375\n\nSo total is 188,329,365 +39.375=188,329,404.375\n\nBut since L_n must be an integer, and we have L_n=35/72*9^n -3/8\n\nSo, 35/72*9^9=188,329,404.375\n\nThen subtract 3/8=0.375\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 -0.375=188,329,404\n\nWhich matches our step-by-step computation. So that confirms that L_9=188,329,404.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the recurrence relation also leads to the same result. So I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive kind of expression, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Let me try to visualize this. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then working my way outwards. That might be the easiest way to handle it.\n\nSo, let me write down each step as I go. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's count how many layers there are. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so I think I need to compute from the 9th layer up to the first. Let me label them from inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3 * (result of Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + (result of Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 3 * (result of Layer 3)\nAnd so on... Wait, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So each time, it's 3*(1 + something). \n\nWait, maybe I should write this as a recursive formula. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), and the base case would be f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(2) would be 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then f(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Then 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Then 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Then 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Then 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Then 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Let me count the layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer wraps another 3*(1 + ...). So if I have 9 layers, then f(9) would be the total. Let me list each f(n) step by step.\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the value of the expression is 36,084. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with f(1) = 4, correct.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15, correct.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, correct.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147, correct.\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444, correct.\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335, correct.\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008, correct.\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027, correct.\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084, correct.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again, perhaps using another approach. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for f(n). Let's see:\n\nf(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1))\n\nExpanding this, f(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be the solution to f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p.\n\nPlugging into the equation: f_p = 3 + 3*f_p\n\nSo, f_p - 3*f_p = 3 => -2*f_p = 3 => f_p = -3/2\n\nBut that's a fraction, and our initial conditions are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern by computing the first few terms.\n\nFrom before:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 15\n\nf(3) = 48\n\nf(4) = 147\n\nf(5) = 444\n\nf(6) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3, but wait, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous term), which is the same as 3 + 3*previous term.\n\nWait, so f(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can express it as f(n) = 3^n + something.\n\nLet me try to compute f(n) in terms of 3^n.\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nn=1: f(1)=4=3^1 +1\n\nn=2: f(2)=15=3^2 +6\n\nn=3: f(3)=48=3^3 + 15\n\nn=4: f(4)=147=3^4 + 48\n\nn=5: f(5)=444=3^5 + 147\n\nn=6: f(6)=1335=3^6 + 444\n\nn=7: f(7)=4008=3^7 + 1335\n\nn=8: f(8)=12027=3^8 + 4008\n\nn=9: f(9)=36084=3^9 + 12027\n\nWait, so f(n) = 3^n + f(n-1), but that doesn't seem to hold because, for example, f(2)=15, which is 3^2 +6=9+6=15, but f(1)=4, so 3^1 +1=4. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurate to say f(n) = 3^n + something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -3)/2=(9-3)/2=6/2=3. But f(1)=4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's write the recurrence as f(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1). This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has solution f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), let's assume a constant particular solution, say f_p.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: f_p = 3 + 3*f_p\n\nSo, f_p - 3*f_p = 3 => -2*f_p = 3 => f_p = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow apply the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 \u2248 1.8333\n\nHmm, that's a fractional coefficient, which seems odd given that all our computed f(n) are integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I should try a different form for the particular solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the particular solution should be of the form A*n + B, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let me try that.\n\nAssume f_p(n) = A*n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A*n + B = 3 + 3*(A*(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 3 + 3A(n -1) + 3B = 3 + 3A*n - 3A + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*n + B\n\nRight side: 3A*n + (3 - 3A + 3B)\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nFor n terms: A = 3A => A - 3A = 0 => -2A = 0 => A=0\n\nFor constants: B = 3 - 3A + 3B\n\nSince A=0, this becomes B = 3 + 3B => B - 3B = 3 => -2B = 3 => B = -3/2\n\nSo the particular solution is f_p(n) = 0*n - 3/2 = -3/2\n\nThen the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow apply f(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nHmm, that's the same result as before. So f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: f(1)= (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 = 11/2 - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2)= (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5: (11/6)*243 - 3/2 = (2673/6) - 3/2 = 445.5 - 1.5 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6: (11/6)*729 - 3/2 = (8019/6) - 3/2 = 1336.5 - 1.5 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7: (11/6)*2187 - 3/2 = (24057/6) - 3/2 = 4009.5 - 1.5 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8: (11/6)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/6) - 3/2 = 12028.5 - 1.5 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9: (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 = (216513/6) - 3/2 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the expression is indeed 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the formula as f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + something, but since I already have the correct formula and verified it with the step-by-step computation, I think that's sufficient.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute f(9) using the formula:\n\nf(9) = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\n3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, (11/6)*19683 = (11*19683)/6\n\nLet me compute 19683 \u00f7 6 first: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280*11=36,080 and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36,080 +5.5=36,085.5\n\nThen subtract 3/2=1.5: 36,085.5 -1.5=36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula gives the correct result, and the step-by-step computation also leads to 36,084.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times the sum of 1 and the result of the previous layer. After calculating each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

So, I need to compute this step by step, each time using the result from the previous layer.\n\nLet me start computing each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after computing all layers, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression, which we computed as 29524.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me cross-verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made an error in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\n\n*          3\n\n__________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n= 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go back through each layer again to see if I made any mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but since it's a finite nested multiplication, computing each layer step by step is the most straightforward approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a bit more complex, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nI wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. Let me think. If we have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is built upon the previous. The closed-form might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as:\n\nx_{k} = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nSo, x_1 = 4.\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nx_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, using this recurrence, we can compute each term step by step, which is what I did.\n\nTherefore, computing each layer step by step is the correct approach, and I've done that correctly.\n\nSo, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different method or check with another approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, so it's like each layer is (previous layer) multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each time we multiply by 3 and add 1.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 4*3 +1 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 13*3 +1 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 40*3 +1 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 121*3 +1 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 364*3 +1 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1093*3 +1 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 3280*3 +1 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 9841*3 +1 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, that method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final step is multiplying 29524 by 3, which is 88,572.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost layer and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, I can compute each layer step by step. That makes sense because parentheses indicate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be evaluated first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nWait, so each time I go out a layer, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nLet me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, that means there are 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nWait, so my initial count went up to 10 layers, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, step by step, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nLet me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8.

Final multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out, so the final result should be 88572. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can write each step with the exact expression to ensure I didn't skip any layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one, so each step is dependent on the one before. Since I verified each calculation, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this expression without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nThis looks like a nested multiplication where each term is 3 times the next term plus 1. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut since the expression is finite, with 9 layers, it's better to think of it as a finite nested multiplication rather than an infinite series.\n\nBut since we already have the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation confirming the result, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, writing down each multiplication.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous methods. So, every way I compute it, I get 88572 as the result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. There doesn't seem to be any mistake in the calculations, and multiple methods (step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and verifying each layer) all lead to the same result.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n- After computing all 9 layers, multiply the final result by 3 to get the overall value.\n- Each step was verified, and the general solution using recurrence relations also confirmed the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

So, starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, and then each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Since there are multiple layers, I think the best approach is to work from the inside out, solving each set of parentheses one by one.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, that's nine layers deep. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to confirm. Starting from the left, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so 3(...), and each of those has another 3(...) inside, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. Wait, that's nine 3s. So there are nine layers of multiplication and addition. So, I need to compute starting from the innermost 1+3, then work my way out each time.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can substitute each innermost expression with its value and work my way outwards. So, starting from the innermost part:\n\nFirst, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that 4. Let me write that down:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nSo, substituting the previous result as 4, we have:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 40. Let me keep track of each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be:\n\n1 + 3*40\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, that's 121. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121 first:\n\n3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, so that's 364. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, that's 1093. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThat's 3280. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, that's 9841. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's do this step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThat's 29524. Next layer:\n\n1 + 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12.\n\nSo adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, that's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result:\n\n3*88573\n\nLet me compute that. 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait a second, let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps seem correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the outermost layer, which is just multiplied by 3. So, I think 265719 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, starting from the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\na_11 = 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, each a_i is defined as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form formula for such a sequence. Let me think. It's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where in this case, c=3 and d=1. \n\nThe standard solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = (a_1 + (d)/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} - (d)/(c - 1)\n\nLet me check if that applies here. Wait, actually, the standard form is a bit different. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d.\n\nThe solution is:\n\na_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which is after the first iteration. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the sequence as starting from a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. Let me try that.\n\nIf I set a_0 = 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich matches our earlier terms. So, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation can be found using the method of solving linear recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3*B = 1 => -2*B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\n1 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=10: a_{10} = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=11: a_{11} = (3^{12} - 1)/2 = (531441 - 1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720\n\nWait, hold on. When I compute a_{11} using the formula, I get 265720, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 265719. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's a_1 = 4, as before. Then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses. So, does that mean 10 layers? But in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_{10}, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result, which was 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_{11} would be (3^{12} -1)/2 = 265720. But that's off by one. Hmm, where is the confusion here?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a_n where n starts at 0, so a_0 =1, a_1=4, a_2=13,... up to a_{10}=88573, which is 11 terms. So, if I want to compute the expression which is 3*a_{10}, that would be 3*(88573)=265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_{10} = (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719, which matches my step-by-step.\n\nBut when I computed a_{11} using the formula, I got 265720, which is one more than the step-by-step result. So, the formula is correct, but in the problem, we only have 10 layers, so we're at a_{10}, not a_{11}.\n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each time there's an opening parenthesis, let's count them:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write each opening parenthesis as '(':\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses. Each corresponding to each multiplication by 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is a_1, then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_{10}. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}, which is 3*88573=265719.\n\nSo, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n is the number of layers, starting from n=1 as the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the formula accordingly. If the innermost is n=1, then the outermost is n=10, so the total expression is 3*a_{10}.\n\nBut regardless, since I've already computed step-by-step and verified each layer, and the formula gives me the same a_{10}=88573, then 3*88573=265719.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*88573 again:\n\n3*80000=240000\n\n3*8000=24000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*70=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding these together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3:\n\n88573\n*     3\n--------\n265719\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each layer and verifying using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 265719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of additions and multiplications. It starts with the innermost parentheses and works its way out. So, maybe the best approach is to start from the inside and work my way outwards, solving each layer one by one. That seems logical because each layer depends on the result of the previous one. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nOkay, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, so I replace that part with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*(result of innermost)).\n\nSo, the next layer out from the innermost is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*4: 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))\n\nOkay, so now the next layer is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that.\n\n3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, that layer becomes 121. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*121). Compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, that layer becomes 364. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that layer becomes 1093. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093). Compute 3*1093. Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that layer becomes 3280. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*3280). Compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that layer becomes 9841. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(9841))\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that layer becomes 29524. Now, the expression is:\n\n3(29524)\n\nFinally, the last layer is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 can be broken down as 29000 + 524.\n\nCompute 3*29000 = 87000.\n\nCompute 3*524: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 + 72 = 1572.\n\nNow, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing all the layers step by step, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps, let me go through them again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n3. 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121\n5.1 +3*121=1+363=364\n6.1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n7.1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8.1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9.1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10.3*29524=88572\n\nEach step seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested multiplications and additions. Each part is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus another similar expression. It looks like a recursive structure, maybe? Let me try to parse it from the inside out. Sometimes, when expressions are nested like this, starting from the innermost part makes it easier.\n\nSo, let me write it out step by step. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me calculate that: 3 * 4 = 12. \n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The structure is 3(1 + ... ). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next part). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3 times that 4, which is 12. Then, the next layer is 1 + 12, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, I think I was a bit confused earlier. Let me try to outline this properly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 3*(result of layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each layer as a separate step. Let me try to write each step down:\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe it's better to define each layer as:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps it's better to compute from the inside out, starting with the innermost, then building up each layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result of innermost)). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer is 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result of previous layer)). So, that's 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we compute the next layer by taking 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's do this step by step for all layers.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result of layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + ...)\n3. 3*(1 + ...)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, there are 9 sets of parentheses, each with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. So, the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer is built on top of that. So, perhaps there are 9 layers? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. Let me count how many times 3(1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write it as a nested structure:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost as Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should approach it as a recursive sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next term would be a(2) = 1 + 3*a(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na(3) = 1 + 3*a(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na(4) = 1 + 3*a(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na(5) = 1 + 3*a(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na(6) = 1 + 3*a(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na(7) = 1 + 3*a(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na(8) = 1 + 3*a(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na(9) = 1 + 3*a(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a(9), since the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are 9 layers. Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each 3*(...) adds another layer. So, counting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9. So, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 40, up to a(9) = 29524.\n\nWait, but when I compute a(9), that would be the result of the innermost 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*a(9). Wait, but let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first 3 is multiplying the entire nested expression, which has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers inside the initial 3 is 9. So, the initial 3 is multiplied by a(9), which is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step by step, because it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, writing down each a(n) as I go.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count them:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1. Each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a new layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each adding a new (1+3(...)). Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and the initial 3 is multiplied by that Layer 9 result.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute the expression step by step, writing each layer as I go.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Compute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*4 = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 3*13 = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 3*40 = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 3*121 = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 3*364 = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 3*1093 = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 3*3280 = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 3*9841 = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each step builds on the previous one, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a geometric series or recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recursive formula is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a(n) = 3*a(n-1), which has the solution a_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p(n) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n0 = 1 + 2K\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches.\n\nn=4:\n\na(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches.\n\nn=5:\n\na(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a(9) =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each containing 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the result of the previous one. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with a 1 and adds 3 multiplied by the result of the next parentheses. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me check again. The innermost parentheses is the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, replacing that with 4, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake there. Let me count the number of parentheses to make sure I'm replacing the correct one. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one, so starting from the end, the last closing parenthesis is part of (1 + 3). So, that's the innermost one. So, replacing (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer out is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, moving one step out, we have (1 + 3*(result of innermost)). Since the innermost was 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, replacing that part in the expression, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me make sure I'm replacing the right part. Each time I compute a layer, I should replace that entire parentheses with its result. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me recount. Each time I replace a layer, I go one step out. So, starting from the innermost, which is step 1, then step 2, up to step 9, and then the final multiplication by 3. Let me write this down more clearly.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Replace that with 4, so the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Replace that 13, so the next layer is (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Replace that 40, so next layer is (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Replace that 121, so next layer is (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Replace that 364, so next layer is (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Replace that 1093, so next layer is (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Replace that 3280, so next layer is (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Replace that 9841, so the next layer is (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after all the parentheses are computed, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\nStep 10: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 3 * 29524 can be computed as follows:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3 * 500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps when computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the steps up to 29524 are correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I feel like this might be too large. Let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I replace a layer, I move one step out. So, with nine layers, I should have nine steps of computation, and then the final multiplication by 3 as step 10.\n\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses:\n\nEach time I see a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of opening parentheses is 9, each corresponding to a closing one. So, yes, nine layers.\n\nSo, step 1 to step 9 correspond to each layer, and then step 10 is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3 * previous layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the step number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each step is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. However, since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and a constant term of 1 added each time.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether computing step by step or using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Replace that with 4, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Replace that 13, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Replace that 40, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Replace that 121, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Replace that 364, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Replace that 1093, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Replace that 3280, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Replace that 9841, so the next layer is:\n   \\[ (1 + 3 \\times 9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$, right? Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost expression is $1 + 3$. That equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n   $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that. So, the very last part was $1 + 3$, which is 4, so the next layer up is $1 + 3(4)$. Hmm, maybe I should write this step by step. Let me list each step as I go outwards.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and each time we go out, we have another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses, so nine layers. Let me confirm:\n\nThe original expression is:\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nYes, each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward, updating the expression each time.\n\nLet me write each step clearly.\n\n1. Innermost layer: Compute $1 + 3$\n   - $1 + 3 = 4$\n   - Now, replace that part in the expression:\n     $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\n2.

Let me compute that.\n\n10. Compute $3 \\times 29524$\n    - 3 times 29,524: Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n    - 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n      - 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n      - 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n      - 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n      - 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n      - 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n      So, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplications.\n\nStarting from step 1:\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3\u00d729524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps seem correct. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and then added 1, except for the last step, where I just multiplied by 3. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or a pattern.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose I have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is f(1) = 4, and each subsequent layer is built by f(k) = 1 + 3*f(k-1). So, for n layers, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nI remember that for such recurrence relations, we can find a closed-form formula. Let me try to derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, f(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait a second, in our problem, we started with the innermost layer as f(1)=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each layer outwards increases n by 1. So, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back, the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nSo, n=9 in the formula.\n\nThus, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's exactly the number I got in step 9, which was 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572, which is the final result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more directly without going through each layer step by step. That's a good check. It confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it using the formula.\n\nGiven n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYep, same result. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the way numbers are built in base 3, but I don't know if that's helpful here.\n\nBut in any case, both methods, the step-by-step computation and the formula, give me the same answer, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing from the innermost layer outward, we find each successive value. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems recursive, like each layer depends on the one before it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost bracket:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost part as A\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then moving outwards, the next layer would be A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081\n- Then A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082\n- And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, if I can compute each A\u2081, A\u2082, A\u2083, etc., step by step, I can build up the solution.

A\u2085 is 364. Moving on to A\u2086:\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA\u2086 is 1093. Then A\u2087:\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, that's a jump. A\u2087 is 3280. Now, A\u2088:\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA\u2088 is 9841. Next, A\u2089:\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nAnd finally, A\u2081\u2080:\nA\u2081\u2080 = 1 + 3*A\u2089 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait a second, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers, right? Wait, no, let me count again.\n\nLooking at it: each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, we have A\u2081 through A\u2089, each depending on the previous.\n\nWait, earlier I went up to A\u2081\u2080, which might be incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\nThen, moving out, each step adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see the depth.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, the expression ends with nine closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, we have A\u2081 to A\u2089.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's nine layers. Therefore, we have A\u2081 through A\u2089, each computed as A\u2096 = 1 + 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081, starting from A\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed up to A\u2081\u2080, which was incorrect. So, let me correct that. We only need to compute up to A\u2089.\n\nSo, let's start over with the correct number of layers.\n\nCompute A\u2081 to A\u2089, where each A\u2096 = 1 + 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081, starting with A\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, A\u2089 is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*A\u2089. So, the total value is 3*A\u2089.\n\nWait, but A\u2089 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to A\u2081\u2080, I got A\u2081\u2080 = 88573, which is 1 + 3*29524. So, that was A\u2081\u2080, but in reality, since the expression only has nine layers, the outermost operation is 3*A\u2089, not 1 + 3*A\u2089.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after nine layers, the innermost becomes A\u2081, then A\u2082, up to A\u2089, which is the result of the ninth layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, A\u2089 was 29524, so 3*A\u2089 would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I thought of the entire expression as starting with 3*(A\u2089). So, the final result is 3*A\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to A\u2081\u2080, I had A\u2081\u2080 = 88573, which would be 1 + 3*A\u2089, but that's not part of the original expression. So, I think I confused myself earlier by adding an extra layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is that the innermost is A\u2081 = 4, then A\u2082 = 13, A\u2083 = 40, A\u2084 = 121, A\u2085 = 364, A\u2086 = 1093, A\u2087 = 3280, A\u2088 = 9841, A\u2089 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write down the layers step by step, making sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nLet me list each A\u2096:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, A\u2089 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to A\u2081\u2080, I got 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524. But that's not part of the original expression because the original expression ends at A\u2089, and then multiplies by 3.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by computing an extra layer, thinking there were ten layers, but actually, there are nine.\n\nTo confirm, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, nine layers. Therefore, A\u2081 through A\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3*A\u2089.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute it again step by step.\n\nCompute A\u2081 to A\u2089:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression = 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's compute a simpler version with fewer layers. Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich matches our earlier method.\n\nSimilarly, another test case: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, we get 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses is another similar expression. So, starting from the innermost part might be the best approach. That way, I can work my way outwards, simplifying each layer as I go. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). So, let's start there.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). So, 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost parentheses). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, after computing (1 + 3), we substitute that back into the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(that result). \n\nWait, let me check that again. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the inside, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...), that's the innermost. Let me see:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...\n\nSo, let's count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1+3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1+3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1+3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1+3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1+3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1+3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1+3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1+3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after each \"1+3\".\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nL1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 * 3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me see how many times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3(, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can peel away a layer by dividing by 3 and subtracting 1.\n\nWait, but I think I've already correctly identified that there are 9 layers, each adding another \"1+3*(previous)\".\n\nWait, but let me check: the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and then each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- 3( : 1\n\nThen, inside that, 1+3( : 2\n\nThen, 1+3( :3\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3): that's 9 opening parentheses in total after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but actually, the initial 3( is the outermost, and then each layer adds another (, so the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me try computing it in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a form of a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built as follows:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 =1 +39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, perhaps I can compute a_9 more efficiently.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, we set a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of the problem. It's a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Specifically, it's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (and so on))). I count nine sets of parentheses, so there are nine layers here. That means I'll have to compute this from the innermost parentheses outwards, working my way up each layer one by one. \n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). So, substituting the innermost result:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, that's 1 + 12, which equals 13.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. The second innermost expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3). So, 1 + 3 is 4, then 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the second innermost layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nAlright, so now the third layer gives us 40.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(40).\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nWait, 120 plus 1 is 121? Hmm, 120 + 1 is 121, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the fourth layer gives us 121.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(121).\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is... let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWait, 363 + 1 is 364? Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, fifth layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364).\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, sixth layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093).\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, 3279 + 1 is 3280, correct.\n\nSo, seventh layer is 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280).\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nSo, eighth layer is 9841.\n\nNow, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(9841).\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, 29523 + 1 is 29524, correct.\n\nSo, the ninth layer, which is the outermost, gives us 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*(29524). Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, 29524*3: Let me check that calculation again because 29524 is 29,524, and 29,524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation where I thought it was 88,572. Wait, no, actually, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I had 20000*3=60,000; 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that with another method. 29,524 * 3: Let's compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But since it's 29,524, that's 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000*3=90,000, minus 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. Finally, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula, to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, by computing each a_n step by step, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 =29,524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me even more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a deeply nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, and then verifying using a mathematical formula for the recurrence relation, I arrived at the solution of 88,572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially with such a long expression. Each step built on the previous one, and the formula confirmed the results, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with a formula, the computed value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost outwards:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent level adds another 3 times that result. It's like a chain of operations, each one building on the previous. \n\nSince there are multiple layers here, maybe the best way to tackle this is to work from the inside out. That is, start by computing the innermost parentheses and then work my way outward. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet's count how many times this nesting happens. I see that each \"1+3(\" is a new level, and I can count them: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me see... Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each level is enclosed in another set of parentheses, so I think there are nine layers in total. Wait, actually, let me check that again.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer. Let me count the number of 3s outside each parentheses. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then 3*(1+3)\n3. Then 1+ that result\n4. Then 3*(1+ that)\n5. Then 1+ that result\n6. Then 3*(1+ that)\n7. Then 1+ that result\n8. Then 3*(1+ that)\n9. Then 1+ that result\n10. Then 3*(1+ that)\n11. Then 1+ that result\n12. Then 3*(1+ that)\n13. Then 1+ that result\n14. Then 3*(1+ that)\n15. Then 1+ that result\n16. Then 3*(1+ that)\n17. Then 1+ that result\n18. Then 3*(1+ that)\n19. Then 1+ that result\n20. Then 3*(1+ that)\n21. Then 1+ that result\n22. Then 3*(1+ that)\n23. Then 1+ that result\n24. Then 3*(1+ that)\n25. Then 1+ that result\n26. Then 3*(1+ that)\n27. Then 1+ that result\n28. Then 3*(1+ that)\n29. Then 1+ that result\n30. Then 3*(1+ that)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step as I compute it:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Then, 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Then, 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Then, 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Then, 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. Then, 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. Then, 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Then, 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Then, 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573\n20. Then, 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265719\n21. Next layer: 1 + 265719 = 265720\n22. Then, 3*(1 + 265719) = 3*265720 = 797160\n23. Next layer: 1 + 797160 = 797161\n24. Then, 3*(1 + 797160) = 3*797161 = 2391483\n25. Next layer: 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n26. Then, 3*(1 + 2391483) = 3*2391484 = 7174452\n27. Next layer: 1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n28. Then, 3*(1 + 7174452) = 3*7174453 = 21523359\n29. Next layer: 1 + 21523359 = 21523360\n30. Then, 3*(1 + 21523359) = 3*21523360 = 64570080\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(1 + previous result). Let me count the number of 3s outside each parentheses. \n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n4. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n5. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n6. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n7. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n8. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n9. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n10. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n11. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n12. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n13. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n14. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n15. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n16. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n17. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n18. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n19. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n20. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n21. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n22. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n23. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n24. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n25. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n26. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n27. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n28. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n29. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n30. Then, 3*(1 + result)\n31. Finally, the outermost 3*(1 + result)\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the original expression only has a certain number of layers. Let me recount. Each time I see a \"3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"3(\" appears. Let me look:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is the outermost, then each \"3(\" inside is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3...\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 3*(1+3). Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2). Up to layer9: 3*(1 + layer8). Then, the outermost 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, so total layers are 9, plus the outermost, making it 10 layers? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + result2)\n4. 3*(1 + result3)\n5. 3*(1 + result4)\n6. 3*(1 + result5)\n7. 3*(1 + result6)\n8. 3*(1 + result7)\n9. 3*(1 + result8)\n10. 3*(1 + result9)\n11. 3*(1 + result10)\n\nWait, no, that's too many. Let me try a different approach. Let me think of it as a recursive expression. Each time, you have 3*(1 + previous). So, if I denote each layer as a term, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from term1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen term2 = 3*(1 + term1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nWait, no, that's not right because term2 would be 3*(1 + term1), but term1 is 4, so term2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\na_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Because from the innermost (1+3), there are 8 more layers, making it 9 layers in total. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each \"3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nSo, the initial expression is 3(1+3(...)), so that's the first 3. Then, inside, it's 3(1+3(...)), which is the second 3, and so on. Let me count how many times \"3(\" appears after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3.\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Then, inside, the next \"3(\" is the second layer.\n3. Then, inside that, another \"3(\" is the third layer.\n4. Continuing this way, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me see: after the initial 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more \"3(\" instances. Wait, no, let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3.\n\nEach time I see a \"3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then inside it, there's another 3, then another, and so on. Let me count:\n\n- The initial 3 is layer 1.\n- Then, inside it, the next 3 is layer 2.\n- Then, inside that, another 3 is layer 3.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, each \"3(\" is a new layer, and I can see that there are 8 more \"3(\" after the first one, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I tried earlier, I got up to a_10 = 108255. But let me check again. Maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each \"1 + 3(\" as a step. Let me try to compute each step methodically.\n\nLet me start by writing down each step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep 3: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nStep 10: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 8 more \"3(\" instances, making it 9 layers in total. So, after computing up to Step9, which is 36084, that would be the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, which gives 36084, the next step is to compute 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. But wait, is that the final answer? Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers inside. So, when I compute up to Step9, that's the value of the innermost 9 layers, which is 36084. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) would be 3*36085 = 108255. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me clarify: Each \"3(\" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, which is layer1. Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, layer2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to layer9, which would be 3*(1 + previous layer8). Then, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, no, that would make it layer10. But in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, let me recount the layers by looking at the number of \"3(\" instances after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each \"3(\" inside adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Inside it, the next \"3(\" is the second layer.\n3. Inside that, another \"3(\" is the third layer.\n4. Continuing this way, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me see: After the initial 3, there are 8 more \"3(\" instances, making it 9 layers in total. So, the innermost is layer9, which is (1+3). Then, each layer above is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, layer9: (1+3)=4\n\nlayer8: 3*(1 + 4)=15\n\nlayer7: 3*(1 +15)=48\n\nlayer6: 3*(1 +48)=147\n\nlayer5: 3*(1 +147)=444\n\nlayer4: 3*(1 +444)=1335\n\nlayer3: 3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\nlayer2: 3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\nlayer1: 3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 +36084)=108255\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is the outermost, then each \"3(\" is a new layer. So, if there are 9 \"3(\" after the initial one, that makes 10 layers in total. Wait, no, because the initial 3 is the first layer, and each \"3(\" inside adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me approach it differently. Let me define the expression as follows:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. Next layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nSo, after computing all 9 layers from the innermost, the result is 108255.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\" inside the outermost 3. So, each time, we're adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my steps above, I went up to step10, which would be the 10th layer. But perhaps the initial 3 is the first layer, and each inner \"3(\" adds another layer, so with 9 inner \"3(\"s, making it 10 layers in total. So, the final result is 108255.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually.\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nSo, in this case, with 3 layers inside, the result is 147.\n\nWait, but according to my step-by-step approach above, if I have 3 layers inside, I would compute:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 3*(1+4)=15\n\n3. 3*(1+15)=48\n\n4. 3*(1+48)=147\n\nSo, that's 4 steps, but the original expression only has 3 layers inside. Hmm, so perhaps the number of steps is one more than the number of layers inside.\n\nWait, in the example above, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which has 3 inner \"3(\"s. So, the number of steps is 3 + 1 = 4. So, in the original problem, with 9 inner \"3(\"s, the number of steps would be 9 + 1 = 10, resulting in 108255.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in the smaller example, 3 layers inside lead to 4 steps, resulting in 147. Similarly, in the original problem, 9 layers inside lead to 10 steps, resulting in 108255.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 108255.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet's go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. Outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 108255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to find the result without computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis kind of expression is a nested multiplication, where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). It resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value after n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\na_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nLooking at the sequence: 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084, 108255\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\nFrom a_1=4 to a_2=15: 3*4=12, but 15 is 12 + 3.\n\nFrom a_2=15 to a_3=48: 3*15=45, but 48 is 45 + 3.\n\nWait, that's not consistent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric progression with a common ratio.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na_2 = 15, which is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nSo, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a general formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nAlternatively, factoring:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works for the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the innermost layer, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is a_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 +"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a bunch of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like it's a repeating pattern. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, starting from the inside: the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, let me write that down.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, maybe I should represent this as a recursive expression or something. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to just compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2), and so on.\n\nWait, so let me write each step clearly:\n\nLet me number each step from the inside out. There are 9 sets of parentheses, so I think there are 9 layers. Let me confirm that. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Each time, it's inside another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and since there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are 9 layers to compute.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this result R1.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*R1. So, substituting R1:\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this R2.\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*R2:\n\n3. Compute 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. R3.\n\nNext layer:\n\n4. Compute 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. R4.\n\nWait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, R4 is 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. Compute 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. R5.\n\nNext:\n\n6. Compute 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. R6.\n\nNext:\n\n7. Compute 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. R7.\n\nWait, 3*1093: Let me check that calculation. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\n8. Compute 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. R8.\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Okay.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. Compute 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, let's compute 3*9841 first. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Let's call this R9.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(R9), because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, now we compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because each step seems to be increasing exponentially, but maybe that's just how it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*R, where R is the result from the previous step. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might make this easier instead of computing each step.\n\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since we derived the formula, we can compute a_n directly without computing each step.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. Using the formula is more efficient, especially if there were more layers.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue substituting and computing each layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4.

Let me try to count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to the next 1, and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Hmm, let's see: \n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then that is multiplied by 3 and added to another 1. So each step, it's like we're doing another layer of 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see how many layers there are. \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(...), and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of 1+3 sections. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(result of 1)\n3. Next: 1+3*(result of 2)\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...1))\n3. (1+3(...2))\n4. (1+3(...3))\n5. (1+3(...4))\n6. (1+3(...5))\n7. (1+3(...6))\n8. (1+3(...7))\n9. (1+3(...8))\n10. (1+3(...9))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Let me check again. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)), and so on until we have 9 layers. So actually, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So perhaps it's a 9-level nested expression.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

So actually, there are 9 layers of multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So it's 9 levels deep.\n\nSo maybe the way to solve this is to start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards, computing each step one by one. That sounds manageable.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1)\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n...\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8)\nThen the total expression is 3*(L9)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 = 1 + 3*(L8). So maybe I should compute L1 to L9 and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute that: 3*29524\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute too many.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. L1: 1+3=4\n2. L2: 1 + 3*4=13\n3. L3: 1 + 3*13=40\n4. L4: 1 + 3*40=121\n5. L5: 1 + 3*121=364\n6. L6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n7. L7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n8. L8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n9. L9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so L9 is correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a*(a + a*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nSo it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute L9 again using the formula.\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer, which might be faster for larger numbers, but in this case, since n=9, it's manageable.\n\nWait, let me see if I can use the formula for the entire expression. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So that's 3*L9, where L9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the outermost is 3*that.\n\nSo the entire expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 3*(L9), where L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo both methods agree, so I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation of each layer. Let me recompute each L1 to L9 quickly.\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3 to get the total value:\n\\[\n3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by looking at the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a series of nested expressions where each time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part and working our way out might be the best approach. That usually works with nested expressions because you can solve the innermost parentheses first and then substitute those values back into the outer expressions.\n\nSo, let me try to identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since I just replaced the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next one becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). The ... here would be the previous result, which is 13. So, this becomes (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next expression is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, now we're at 364.\n\nGoing another step out, the expression becomes (1 + 3*364). Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nContinuing, the next level is (1 + 3*1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, now we have 3280.\n\nMoving out another level, we have (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's 9841.\n\nNext, the expression becomes (1 + 3*9841). Let's calculate: 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, and 1 + 88572 is 88573. That's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*88573. Let me calculate that: 3 times 80,000 is 240,000; 3 times 8,000 is 24,000; 3 times 500 is 1,500; 3 times 70 is 210; and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those up: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500; 265,500 + 210 is 265,710; and 265,710 + 9 is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems a bit high. Maybe I should do it another way. 88573 multiplied by 3. Let me break it down:\n\n88,573\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 7 is 21, carry over the 2; 3 times 5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, carry over the 1; 3 times 8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carry over the 2; 3 times 8 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So, writing that down, it's 265,719. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount the number of times I replaced the innermost parentheses. The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, and each of those is nested.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine steps, each time moving out one level. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives us 3*29524 = 88572? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my earlier steps, I think I messed up the count. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, how many times does 1 + 3 get nested? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds one more level. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent is one more level. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\nWait, so that's actually ten steps? Because the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each time we have a new level, so starting from 1, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times do we have the 1 + 3*...?\n\nLet me think: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... (1 + 3)))) with nine 1 + 3s. Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside, we have 1 + 3(...). Each time, we have another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are nine instances of \"1 + 3(\" inside the expression. So, each time, we have to compute each level, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 8: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Level 7: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Level 6: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Level 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Level 4: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Level 3: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Level 2: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Level 1: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all nine levels, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which would be 3*(29524). But according to my previous calculation, that's 88572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 29524 and then said the outermost is 3*29524, which is 88572, but then in my second calculation, I thought it was 3*88573, which was 265,719. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine levels. So, each time, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, each subsequent level is (1 + 3*previous result). So, after nine levels, we get to 29524, and then we have to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, so that's 29524*3. Let me compute that correctly. 29,524 multiplied by 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 29524, then 3*29524 is 88,572, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 29524 and then went to 88573, which was incorrect because I thought the outermost was 3*(1 + 3*29524), but no, actually, the outermost is just 3*(result after nine levels). So, 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me recount the levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think my initial confusion was because I miscounted the number of levels, but upon recounting, it's clear that after nine levels, we have 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations at each level. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting with Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*4). 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*9841). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. As above, that's 88,572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have multiple levels, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me compute each level again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've verified each step, and all the calculations check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try to compute it in a different way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given the structure, it's a linear nesting of expressions, so each step depends on the previous one, which suggests that we have to compute each level step by step as we did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think: Let's denote a_n as the value at each level, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. So, to summarize, by starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way out, step by step, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1, we arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves calculating the value inside the parentheses and substituting it into the outer expression until the entire expression is simplified.\n\n1. **Innermost Expression**: Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Next Level**: Substitute 4 into the next level: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n3. **Continue Substituting**: Each subsequent level uses the result from the previous step:\n   - (1 + 3*13) = 40\n   - (1 + 3*40) = 121\n   - (1 + 3*121) = 364\n   - (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n   - (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n   - (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n   - (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a nested set of additions and multiplications. It seems like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and then multiplied by 3 again. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the inside: the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, that result is going to be multiplied by 3 in the next layer. So, the next part is 3 times that 4. Let me write that down: 3 * 4 = 12. \n\nWait, so the next layer is 1 + 12. Let me compute that. 1 + 12 equals 13. Okay, so now we have 13. That's the result of the second innermost expression. Now, moving out another layer, we have 3 times this 13. So, 3 * 13 is 39. \n\nNext, we add 1 to that 39. So, 1 + 39 equals 40. Now, moving out another layer, we have 3 times 40, which is 120. Then, we add 1 to 120, getting 121. \n\nContinuing outward, 3 times 121 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. Next, 3 times 364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. \n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm keeping track correctly. Let me list each step as I go through each layer. Maybe I can number the layers to avoid confusion.\n\nLet's label each layer from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3 * (Layer 1) = 3 * 4 = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3 * (Layer 2) = 3 * 13 = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3 * (Layer 3) = 3 * 40 = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3 * (Layer 4) = 3 * 121 = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3 * (Layer 5) = 3 * 364 = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3 * (Layer 6) = 3 * 1093 = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3 * (Layer 7) = 3 * 3280 = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3 * (Layer 8) = 3 * 9841 = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot.

So the entire expression is 3*a9, right? Because a9 is the innermost, and each subsequent a is built by 1 + 3*a_next.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4.\n\nThen moving outward, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the first step is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen next is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I defined a9 as 29524, but the entire expression is 3*a9, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but when I did the layers, I had 9 layers, ending at 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside, because the innermost is (1+3), then each additional layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. (1+3*(4)) = 13\n\n3. (1+3*(13)) = 40\n\n4. (1+3*(40)) = 121\n\n5. (1+3*(121)) = 364\n\n6. (1+3*(364)) = 1093\n\n7. (1+3*(1093)) = 3280\n\n8. (1+3*(3280)) = 9841\n\n9. (1+3*(9841)) = 29524\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is that there are eight layers inside the initial 3*(...), so maybe I have one extra layer. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3), then each step adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I have one extra layer. Let me check the count again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3), then each additional layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1+3*(...):\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the number of layers is nine, so perhaps the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm by computing each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or misapply the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such expressions.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so starting from the inside, I think I need to work my way outwards because of all the nested parentheses. That usually makes sense when dealing with such expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. \n\nLooking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now that I have that, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. So the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading it correctly. So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Hmm, so it's like each step is multiplying the next layer by 3 and then adding 1. \n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So each time, you're taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1 to it. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3) = 4. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so now I have 40. Next layer out would be 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, so 121 so far. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that:\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nMoving on, the next layer would be 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that:\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 3*364 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that:\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093. Let me verify that multiplication. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. So 3279 + 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate:\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280. Let's see: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. That looks right.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841. Let me check: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1 to get 29524. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then add 1 to get 88573. That seems correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that:\n\nFinal layer: 3 * 88573\n\nLet me break this down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 88573 * 3.\n\nCompute 80000*3 = 240000\n\nCompute 8000*3 = 24000\n\nCompute 500*3 = 1500\n\nCompute 70*3 = 210\n\nCompute 3*3 = 9\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3 * 88573 = 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait a second, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me just verify one or two of the intermediate steps again to be thorough.\n\nFor example, step 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Correct.\n\nFinal step: 3*88573. 88573*3: 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3=210; 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240,000 +24,000=264,000; +1,500=265,500; +210=265,710; +9=265,719.

That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).

Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now that layer becomes 13. Let me replace that in the expression.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo now, replacing that, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me note that down.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems correct.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWhoa, that's a big jump. Let me confirm: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Yes.\n\nContinuing outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems right.\n\nMoving outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*9841. Let's see, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\nSo adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the next layer is 29524. Replacing that, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate 3*29524 first.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, the next layer is 88573. Moving outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*88573. First, compute 3*88573.\n\n88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9.\n\nAdding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nThen, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me confirm:\n\n88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*265720. First, compute 3*265720.\n\n265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60.\n\nAdding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nThen, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. Correct.\n\nSo, now, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*797161. First, compute 3*797161.\n\n797161 * 3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3.\n\nAdding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000; 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000; 2391000 + 300 = 2391300; 2391300 + 180 = 2391480; 2391480 + 3 = 2391483.\n\nThen, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n797161 * 3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000; 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000; 2391000 + 300 = 2391300; 2391300 + 180 = 2391480; 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part of the expression because that seems logical. When dealing with nested parentheses, it's usually best to work from the inside out. So, the innermost part here is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the very last part. Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see. So, after simplifying the innermost, the next one would be 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, each time, I need to compute the innermost first, then work my way outward.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of this as a recursive expression. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I can represent this as a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to outline the layers.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let me count: starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, so:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. It seems like there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) because each time it's 1+3( and then another similar expression. Wait, no, actually, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more layers. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)):\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's see how many layers we have.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and layer 9 is the outermost. So, total of 9 layers. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, we add another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen,\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying L9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 in another way.\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, then each time we add another layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another one. So, L1 to L9, which I computed correctly.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute the layers again quickly.\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the way the layers are nested, it's a bit more involved. However, since I've already confirmed it with two methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014I think it's safe to say that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\n- Each layer is computed by starting from the innermost and working outward.\n\n- The recurrence relation approach confirmed the result.\n\n- The closed-form solution using the recurrence relation also confirmed the result.\n\nTherefore, the final value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1 \\) to \\( L_9 \\):\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   L_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\n   L_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\n   L_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\n   L_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\n   L_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   L_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   L_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   L_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot L_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each containing a 1 and a 3 multiplied together. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step. Let me count them to be sure. Starting from the right, each \"1 + 3\" is one layer, and each 3 multiplied by that is another. So, let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(result of above)\n3. Next layer is (1 + result)\n4. Then, 3*(result of above)\n5. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, I compute the innermost parentheses first, then move outwards. Let me try to map this out step by step.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each time you have 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nEach time, you have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one.\n\nLet me try to list each step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3*4 = 12\n3. Add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n5. Add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n7. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3*121 = 363\n9. Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps? But I thought there were only 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of multiplications by 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) which is 4. Then, multiplied by 3: 3*4 = 12\n- Then, (1 + 12) = 13, multiplied by 3: 39\n- Then, (1 + 39) = 40, multiplied by 3: 120\n- Then, (1 + 120) = 121, multiplied by 3: 363\n- Then, (1 + 363) = 364, multiplied by 3: 1092\n\nWait, so each time I compute (1 + previous result) and then multiply by 3. So starting from the innermost, I have 9 layers of multiplication by 3. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) and working outwards, each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a step, and each is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3*121 = 363\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so that's 9 multiplications by 3, but each time after multiplying, you add 1 in the next layer. So, maybe the total number of operations is 9 multiplications and 9 additions? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer is a \"1 + 3(...)\" which is then multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous.\n\nLet me try to represent this as a recursive process. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the original expression, after the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each step being 3*(1 + previous step). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each step is 3*(1 + previous). Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, S3, etc., where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, that's different from before. Hmm, maybe I was adding 1 after multiplying by 3. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the order.\n\nWait, in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, the order is: compute the innermost (1 + 3), then multiply by 3, then add 1, then multiply by 3, etc. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse the expression correctly. Let me consider the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, starting from the innermost.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that seems different from my previous approach. So, which one is correct? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time computing 3*(1 + previous). So, the outermost layer would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255. Wait, but that's not matching my earlier steps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)).\n\nSo, let me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the outermost expression is Level 9, which is 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 1092. So, which is correct? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had 10 steps, but that was probably because I was counting both the addition and multiplication as separate steps, but perhaps the correct way is to consider each 3*(1 + ...) as a single step. So, with 9 such steps, we end up with 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, this is a recursive relation where each term is defined as 3*(1 + previous term). Let me denote the nth term as a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4 (from (1 + 3))\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nBecause 3/2 = 9/6, so:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\nLet me compute 10*19683 = 196,830\n\nThen, 1*19683 = 19,683\n\nAdding them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6\n\nLet me compute this division:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0\n\n6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5\n\n6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2\n\n6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0\n\nSo, 216,504 \u00f7 6 = 36,084\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 36,084\n\nSo, the value of the entire expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got the same result, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at 36,084. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula which also gave me 36,084 when n=9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 3^9 is indeed 19,683.\n\nThen, 11*19,683: Let's compute 10*19,683 = 196,830 and 1*19,683 = 19,683, so adding them gives 216,513.\n\nSubtracting 9 gives 216,504.\n\nDivided by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6. Let me do this division step by step.\n\n6 into 21 is 3 (3*6=18), remainder 3.\n\nBring down the 6: 36. 6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\nBring down the 5: 05. 6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5.\n\nBring down the 0: 50. 6 into 50 is 8 (8*6=48), remainder 2.\n\nBring down the 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo, the quotient is 36,084. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, both the step-by-step computation and the formula give me the same result, 36,084. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a recurrence relation to solve it more efficiently. Both methods led me to the same conclusion, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By carefully evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can determine the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 1}) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 2}) = 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 3}) = 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 4}) = 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 5}) = 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 6}) = 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 7}) = 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + \\text{Layer 8}) = 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a bunch of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each step depends on the result of the innermost part. Let me try to parse this from the inside out. Maybe if I start from the innermost parenthesis and work my way outward, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading the expression correctly. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of 3s, each time inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and it's repeated multiple times. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, we have a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: from the innermost to the outermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s inside.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Each \"1+3(...)\" adds another layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a depth of 9 layers. Because starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each parenthesis after that is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each time we have a \"(\", so let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each with a new \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, that would mean 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost 1+3. So, as I computed earlier, the innermost is 4, then each layer builds on that.\n\nSo, let me write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is built by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then after 9 layers, multiplying by 3 again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), so that's why it's 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the outermost operation is indeed 3*(...). Yes, because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the result of the 9 nested layers.\n\nSo, yes, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. I double-checked each step, both by computing manually and by using the recurrence relation formula. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find the final result to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like there's a repeating pattern here. Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how you handle parentheses. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Wait, but the next one is (1 + 3(1 + 3)). Hmm, so the innermost part was 4, so the next level would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The innermost is 1+3=4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4), which is 1 + 12=13. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that:\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems right.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(40)). Let's compute that:\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, so 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*(121)). Let me calculate that:\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(364)). Let's see:\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nMoving out another level: (1 + 3*(1093)). Calculating that:\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(3280)). Let me compute that:\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nAnother layer out: (1 + 3*(9841)). Calculating:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\nLevel 10: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a miscalculation. Let me recount the levels to ensure I didn't miss any. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems to be 10 levels, each time moving outward. So, each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and then added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3. Let me double-check a few of these calculations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting with Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*(9000 + 800 + 40 + 1). So 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, it seems that the computations are accurate. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. \n\nI wonder if there's a formula or a pattern here that could have made this easier instead of computing each step manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. \n\nLet me denote each step as a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general term is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. The recurrence is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4. Hmm, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard method to solve such recursions is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a\u2084=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a\u2085=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a\u2086=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a\u2087=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a\u2088=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a\u2089=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nn=10: a_{10}= (3^{11} -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Wait, hold on. Wait, but in our earlier computation, the outermost step was 3*29524=88572, not 88573. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Did I make a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me check. The formula gives a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=10, a_{10} = (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. But according to my step-by-step computation earlier, the final result was 88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? Let me check the step-by-step again. The last step was 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, it's 88573. Hmm, so there's a problem here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's one level, and each subsequent multiplication adds another level. Let me count how many times we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) =13\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nWait, wait, no, hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), which is a layer. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) =13\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n\nSo, that's 10 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*previous). Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so the final result is 3*88573=265719. Wait, but earlier, I thought the final result was 88572, but that was because I stopped at 3*29524=88572, which was incorrect because I missed the last layer.\n\nWait, so I think I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), and layer2 is (1 + 3*(layer3)), etc., until layer10, which is (1 + 3*(1+3)). So, in total, there are 10 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, when I computed up to a\u2089=29524, that was after 9 layers. Then, layer10 would be (1 + 3*29524)=1 + 88572=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to 3*29524=88572, which was incorrect because I didn't account for the 10th layer. So, actually, the correct final result should be 265,719.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier formula because according to the formula, a\u2099=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. If n=10, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and then multiplied by 3 gives 265719.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought the final result was 88572, but that was because I stopped at the 9th layer and multiplied by 3, which was a mistake.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(layer1). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3*, let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)):\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nContinuing, each * is inside another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of (1 + 3*(...) starting from the innermost. Let me see:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have (1 + 3*(...)), so:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n\nSo, that's 10 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer10)=3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, my initial mistake was stopping at layer9 and multiplying by 3, which gave me 88,572, but actually, there's one more layer, making it 10 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a\u2099=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=10, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and then the total expression is 3*a_{10}=265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. The formula I derived was for a\u2099, where a\u2099 is the result after n layers. So, if I have 10 layers, a_{10}=88573, and then the total expression is 3*a_{10}=265,719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula can be adjusted. Wait, in the formula, a\u2099 is the value after n layers, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=10, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}=3*(88573)=265,719.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(a_{10}), where a_{10}=88573, then the total is 265,719.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step-by-step, I thought I had 10 layers and ended up with 88,572, which was incorrect because I missed that the final multiplication by 3 is outside all the layers. So, actually, the correct result should be 265,719.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I only went up to 3*29524=88,572, which was because I thought that was the outermost layer, but actually, there's one more layer after that.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have (1 + 3*(...)), so:\n\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(88573)=265,719.\n\nSo, in my initial computation, I stopped at step 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, but that was incorrect because there was still one more layer (step10) which is (1 + 3*29524)=88573, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nTherefore, my initial answer of 88,572 was incorrect because I missed the last layer and the final multiplication. The correct answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and then 3*a_{10}=265,719.\n\nSo, that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this because I'm getting conflicting results between my step-by-step and the formula. Let me compute a_{10} using the formula and see if it matches the step-by-step.\n\nFrom the formula, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Then, 3*88573=265,719.\n\nFrom the step-by-step, after 10 layers, we have 88573, then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719. So, that's consistent.\n\nEarlier, I thought I had 10 layers and ended up with 88,572, but that was because I stopped one layer too early. So, the correct final result is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be adjusted to include the final multiplication by 3. Let me think.\n\nIf I let b\u2099 = 3*(a\u2099), where a\u2099 is the result after n layers, then b\u2099=3*a\u2099=3*( (3^{n+1} -1)/2 )=(3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, after 10 layers, a_{10}=88573, so b_{10}=3*a_{10}=265,719.\n\nAlternatively, b\u2099=(3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=10, b_{10}=(3^{12} -3)/2=(531441 -3)/2=531438/2=265,719. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, b\u2099=(3^{n+2} -3)/2, which gives the final result after multiplying by 3. So, for n=10 layers, b_{10}=265,719.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step-by-step, I thought I had 10 layers and ended up with 88,572, but that was because I didn't include the final multiplication by 3. So, actually, the correct answer is 265,719.\n\nLet me confirm this by computing the layers again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n\nThen, 3*88573=265,719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was stopping at the 9th layer and multiplying by 3, which gave me 88,572, but I had to go one more layer and then multiply by 3 to get the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, b\u2099=(3^{n+2} -3)/2, where n=10, gives us b_{10}=(3^{12} -3)/2=265,719.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 265,719.\n\nI think that's the accurate result. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation.\n\nLet me recompute the layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524=1 +88572=88573\n\nThen, 3*88573=265,719.\n\nYes, all these steps check out. So, the final answer is indeed 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(previous layer)). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all 10 layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, the final result is found to be 265,719.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is a smaller version of the whole problem. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, which is the last one: (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next part is 3*(1+3). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). \n\nWait, maybe I should label each layer to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3)\n3. 3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n7. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n8. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n9. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers here. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer1). So, yes, 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so that would mean the entire expression simplifies to 36,084. Hmm, let me check that again because that seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; so 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 400*3=1200, 45*3=135, so 1200+135=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 36*3=108. So 3000+900=3900+108=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let me compute 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27, so 12,000+27=12,027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let me compute 10,000*3=30,000, 2,000*3=6,000, 8*3=24. So 30,000+6,000=36,000+24=36,024. Wait, that's different from what I had before. I thought it was 36,084. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the last step.\n\nWait, 3*12,028: Let's compute it more carefully. 12,028 * 3:\n\n12,000 * 3 = 36,000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Wait, no, that's not right because 12,028 is 12,000 + 28, so 3*12,000 is 36,000, and 3*28 is 84, so 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. So that's correct. Wait, but earlier I thought I had 36,024, which was wrong. So the correct value is 36,084.\n\nWait, so maybe I miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 36,024. Let me check 3*12,028 again. 12,028 * 3:\n\n12,000 * 3 = 36,000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so that would make the final answer 36,084. Let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12,027\n\nLayer 9: 36,084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is calculated correctly, so the final result is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, the sequence is a recursive one: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWait, let me see: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify that: 3^n can be written as 3*3^{n-1}, so (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3*3^{n-1} = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2: a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (11*3^{0} -3)/2 = (11 -3)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (11*3^{1} -3)/2 = (33 -3)/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (11*3^2 -3)/2 = (99 -3)/2 = 96/2=48. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (11*81 -3)/2 = (891 -3)/2=888/2=444. Wait, no, that's not right because 3^4 is 81, so 11*81=891, 891-3=888, 888/2=444. But earlier, a_4 was 147. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in the initial calculation, a_4 was 147, but according to the formula, a_4 would be 444. That's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, let me check the general formula again. Maybe I made a mistake in deriving it.\n\nWe have a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant K. So, substituting into the equation: K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nThus, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, let's compute a_4 using this formula: a_4 = (11/6)*3^4 - 3/2.\n\n3^4 =81.\n\nSo, a_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*81: 11*81 = 891; 891/6=148.5.\n\nThen, 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct! So, a_4=147 as computed earlier. So, the formula works.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (11/6)*3^5 - 3/2.\n\n3^5=243.\n\n(11/6)*243= (11*243)/6.\n\n243 divided by 6 is 40.5, so 40.5*11=445.5.\n\nThen, 445.5 -1.5=444. Correct, as before.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, we can compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 divided by 6: 19683 \u00f76 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, multiply by 11: 3280.5 *11.\n\nLet me compute 3280.5 *10=32805, plus 3280.5=32805+3280.5=36085.5.\n\nThen, subtract 3/2=1.5: 36085.5 -1.5=36084.\n\nSo, a_9=36,084, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each layer manually and also derived a formula to compute it, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is defined as 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, we confirm that the final result is 36,084.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Proceed Outwards Layer by Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula**:\n   - Derived formula: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n   - For n=9: a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 = 36,084\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{36084}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time I compute that something, multiply by 3, add 1, and then move outward. That makes sense because with all those parentheses, the innermost one has to be computed first. \n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parenthesis and working my way out. I'll label each step as Step 1, Step 2, etc., to keep track of where I am. \n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. \n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3. \n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). \n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 1 result). \n\nSubstituting Step 1's result, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, Step 2 result is 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). \n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 2 result). \n\nSo, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Step 3 result is 40. \n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Step 3 result). \n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*40. \n\n3*40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121. So, Step 4 result is 121. \n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(Step 4 result). \n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*121. \n\nLet me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Step 5 result is 364. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 5 result). \n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*364. \n\nFirst, 3*364. Let's compute 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. So, adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 6 result is 1093. \n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(Step 6 result). \n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*1093. \n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 7 result is 3280. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 7 result). \n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*3280. \n\nFirst, 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 8 result is 9841. \n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(Step 8 result). \n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*9841. \n\nHmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Step 9 result is 29524. \n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(Step 9 result). \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the original expression again. The problem is $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nSo, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3*(...). Let's see: \n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). \n\nWait, so when I started, I did 1 + 3 as Step 1, then each subsequent step added another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 1, each time there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of times I see a '(', which indicates a new layer. \n\nStarting from the first '(', after the first 1: \n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \n2. Then another '(', so that's two layers. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Let me see: \n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. Let me see how many layers there are. \n\nWait, in the original expression, how many nested 1+3(...) are there? Let me count the number of '3(' after each '1+3('.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers? Because I see 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time I have a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see '1+3(' after the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3(1+3(...)), each time I see another '1+3(', so how many times does '1+3(' appear?\n\nLet me count each occurrence:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first '1+3(' is inside the first 3(...).\n- Then another '1+3(' inside that, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Because each time you have a 1+3(, and the innermost is 1+3, so perhaps there are 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 8, because starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time you have an opening parenthesis, except the last one which is closed. So, perhaps 8 layers? Wait, but when I did my earlier steps, I went up to Step 9, which resulted in 29524. But then, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing Step 9, which is the innermost layer, we have to go back and compute each layer outward, multiplying by 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(result of step 1)\n3. 1+3*(result of step 2)\n...\nUp to step n.\n\nWait, so in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, we have 1+3(...), and inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3(.\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3(, the first 1+3( is step 1, then another 1+3( inside that is step 2, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many 1+3( are there? Let me see:\n\n- The first 1+3( is after the initial 3(, that's layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another 1+3(, that's layer 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost 1+3, which is layer 8? Because each time we have a 1+3(, except the last one which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3(1+3(...)), there are 8 more 1+3( inside. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (innermost)\n2. 1+3*(1)\n3. 1+3*(result of step 2)\n...\nUp to step 9, which would be the outermost layer before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I have 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). Let me try to count the number of 1+3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3( after the initial 3, that's one. Then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...) \n2. The first 1+3( inside that is the second layer.\n3. Then another 1+3( inside that is the third layer.\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 1+3, which is the ninth layer? Because each time you have a 1+3(, except the last one which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers. Let me see: the expression has 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)). Because after the initial 3(1+3(...)), each time you have a new (, which adds another layer, and there are 8 such parentheses before the last )))))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times 1+3( occurs. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3( after the initial 3, that's one. Then each time you see a 1+3(, that's another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - First 1+3( after 3: that's layer 1\n   - Then inside that, another 1+3( : layer 2\n   - Continue until the innermost 1+3, which is layer 9?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because after the initial 3(, the first 1+3( is layer 1, and each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer, totaling 8 layers. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the number of 1+3( is 8. Because after the initial 3(1+3(...)), each time you have a 1+3(, and there are 8 such occurrences before the last )))))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times you can go into the parentheses. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(...)), where the ... is another 1+3(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many times does the pattern 1+3( occur? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3(, the first 1+3( is the first layer, then inside that another 1+3( is the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1+3, which is the ninth layer? Because each time you have a 1+3(, and there are 8 such parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)), making it 9 layers in total. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me define each step as computing one layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Then, after computing the 9th layer, which gives us 29524, we have the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(result of Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Step 9, which gave me 29524, and that's the result of the innermost layer, right? Or is that the result of the outermost 1+3*(...)? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each step I did was computing a layer, starting from the innermost. So, Step 1: 1+3=4. Step 2: 1+3*4=13. Step 3:1+3*13=40, etc., up to Step 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of Step 9). So, after computing Step 9, I have to multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), where the ... is the nested expression. So, the 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which we computed as 29524. So, the final step is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the last step was Step 9, which gave me 29524, but that was the result of the innermost layer. So, perhaps I need to go back and compute each layer, then multiply by 3 at the end. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did Step 9, I thought that was the final result, but now I realize that's just the result of the innermost layer, and I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final answer. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nEach time I have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I have the correct number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many 1+3( are there? Let's count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(1+3(...)), each time we have another 1+3(, so:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first 1+3( is after the initial 3, that's layer 1\n   - Then inside that, another 1+3(, that's layer 2\n   - Continuing until the innermost 1+3, which is layer 9\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, the result after computing all layers is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524 * 3 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because if I have 9 layers, then the computation is as above. But sometimes when I count layers, I might miscount. Let me try to write the expression with placeholders:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each step again quickly:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered each step, double-checked the number of layers, computed each step manually, and even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the next layer)}\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 2: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have (1 + 12). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is 3 times 13.\n\nStep 4: 3 * 13 = 39.\n\nMoving another layer out, we have (1 + 39).\n\nStep 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext, 3 times 40.\n\nStep 6: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\nMoving out another layer, (1 + 120).\n\nStep 7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, 3 times 121.\n\nStep 8: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 363).\n\nStep 9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 3 times 364.\n\nStep 10: 3 * 364. Hmm, let me compute that. 364 * 3. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3 * 364 = 1092.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have (1 + 1092).\n\nStep 11: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, 3 times 1093.\n\nStep 12: 3 * 1093. Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3 * 1093 = 3279.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3279).\n\nStep 13: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 3 times 3280.\n\nStep 14: 3 * 3280. Let me break that down: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 3 * 3280 = 9840.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 9840).\n\nStep 15: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3 times 9841.\n\nStep 16: 3 * 9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have (1 + 29523).\n\nStep 17: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that result.\n\nStep 18: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, let me do it more accurately:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after computing all the layers step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me quickly go through the steps again.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092\n\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279\n\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840\n\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n16. 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\n17. 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n18. 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves adding 1 and multiplying by 3. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's see, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result. So, I'll need to compute each of these layers one by one.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), layer 2 is the next one out, which is 3*(layer1) + 1, and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). Hmm, wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the very outermost is multiplied by 3, so maybe I should consider that separately. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking again: The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (... and so on. So, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of nesting. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(layer1) + 1. Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse the parentheses correctly.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until we have nine layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(the ninth layer's result). So, actually, the very outermost operation is multiplying by 3, but before that, we have nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer. The problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each time, it's 3*(...). Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...) until we have nine layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(layer1) + 1? Wait, no, because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1). Then layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on, up to layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). That seems more accurate.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's take a smaller version to test. Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). How many layers would that be? Let's parse it:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, three layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, the innermost is layer1, then layer2, layer3, then multiplied by 3. So, in the original problem, since there are nine layers, that would mean layer1 to layer9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute layer1 to layer9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let's compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 8,7,7,5,7,2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 6 digits.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) =7.\n\nNext digit:5 *3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 \u2192 write down7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but that's only 5 digits. Wait, 29524 is 5 digits, multiplied by 3 is 5 digits? Wait, 29524 is 29 thousand, so 3*29 thousand is 87 thousand, which is 5 digits. So, 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the multiplication step by step earlier, I got 88572, which is consistent. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*: there are nine layers. So, layer1 to layer9, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3*(... in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, my computation of nine layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C =1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet's verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrived at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested computation that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern in the recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinal multiplication: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner part. So, to solve this, I should probably start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each parentheses is inside another one, so the innermost one will have the simplest value, and then I can build up from there.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing a 1 + 3 times something. So, starting from the very inside, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost part, which is 4. So, let's compute that.\n\nSecond innermost: 1 + 3 * 4.\n\nWait, hold on, is it 1 + 3 times 4 or 1 + (3 * 4)? I think it's the latter because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, 3 * 4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, let's compute that.\n\nThird innermost: 1 + 3 * 13.\n\nAgain, multiplication first: 3 * 13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. Got it, so that's 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level out is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me calculate that.\n\nFourth innermost: 1 + 3 * 40.\n\n3 * 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times 121. Let's see.\n\nFifth innermost: 1 + 3 * 121.\n\n3 * 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, 364.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3 times 364.\n\nSixth innermost: 1 + 3 * 364.\n\n3 * 364 is... let me compute that. 3 * 300 is 900, 3 * 64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSeventh innermost: 1 + 3 * 1093.\n\n3 * 1000 is 3000, 3 * 93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nEighth innermost: 1 + 3 * 3280.\n\n3 * 3000 is 9000, 3 * 280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nNinth innermost: 1 + 3 * 9841.\n\n3 * 9000 is 27000, 3 * 841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have messed up here. Let me check that multiplication again because 3 * 9841. Maybe I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me do 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, yes, 3 * 9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nOkay, so now that I've computed the innermost expressions step by step, each time I'm moving outward, the value inside the parentheses is getting larger and larger. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times the result of the outermost parentheses, which we just found to be 29524. So, let's compute that.\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nI can compute this as:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe using another method, like adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's compute this:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the number of layers correctly? Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many times you've gone inward.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, yes, nine layers of \"1 + 3(\" each time. So, I correctly computed each layer from 1 to 9, each time moving outward and computing the value.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then finally, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that step again because I might have miscounted the layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3. Then, each layer moving out is one more step. So, maybe I should list each step with the corresponding layer number to make sure.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly, so I think the computation is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me define the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we have a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, it seems the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term), it's similar to building a geometric series, but with a constant addition each time. But in this case, the recurrence is linear, so the formula I found using the recurrence relation is more appropriate.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work here, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula for the nth layer. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step, moving outward.\n\n2. Recognize the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula.\n\n3. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost part: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\].\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part is contained within another. It's like a Russian doll situation with numbers and operations. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, it's recursive in a way. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, let me clarify: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each step depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me try to label each level to keep track:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, I think.\n\nWait, let me count how many levels there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost parentheses. Let me see, each time we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost as Level 1, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, I count 9 sets of parentheses after the first 1+. So, it's 9 layers deep. So, we have Levels 1 through 9, each depending on the previous one. So, I need to compute from Level 1 up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me start computing each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, starting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so Level 9 gives us 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, we have to multiply 29524 by 3.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3) = 4. Then each subsequent level adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, 9 levels in total, right?\n\nYes, because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 1+3(...). So, each level corresponds to one set of parentheses, starting from the innermost. So, 9 levels, leading up to 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check another way. Maybe using a different approach, like recognizing the pattern.\n\nWait a second, this expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, maybe I can compute it without calculating each level. But since n is 9, it's manageable, but perhaps it's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each step is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start computing from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each level step by step, keeping track of the results.\n\n3. Once all levels are computed, multiply the final result by 3.\n\n4. As a check, model the problem as a linear recurrence relation, find a closed-form solution, and verify the result.\n\nBoth approaches led to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all levels, the result is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It looks like a recursive expression where each step depends on the result of the next one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me count how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another similar expression. I think there are nine sets of parentheses here because each \"1+\" starts a new level, and I can count nine opening parentheses before the first \"1+\".\n\nWait, actually, let me count: starting from the innermost, each level adds another 3(...). So maybe it's 8 levels deep? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(result of step 1)\n3. 1 + 3(result of step 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work step by step from the inside out.

So after level 9, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3:\n\nTotal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 3 * 29524.

Let me recount the levels:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression has 9 levels, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new level. So, maybe that's correct.\n\nBut let me try an alternative approach to verify. Maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). Let me denote the levels as a1, a2, a3, ..., a9, where a1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each step again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute a1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly, so maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me check a few steps again.\n\nFor example, a7: 3*1093. Let me compute that.\n\n1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, a7 = 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, a8=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\na9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, a9=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing a9=29524, we multiply by 3, so 3*29524=88572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each level is 1 + 3*previous level. So, perhaps the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} =1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for a9, which is the 9th level, n=9:\n\na9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the general formula, we can compute it without having to compute each step manually, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves adding 1 and multiplying by 3. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a general formula and compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). Let\u2019s denote each level as a_n, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level**:\n   - Level 1 (innermost): a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the General Formula**: Recognizing the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find the solution using linear recurrence techniques:\n   - The general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For n=9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply the result of level 9 by 3:\n   - Total = 3 * a\u2089 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"
