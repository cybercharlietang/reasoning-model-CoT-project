So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. This might have saved time if the number of layers was larger, but for 9 layers, either method works. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
