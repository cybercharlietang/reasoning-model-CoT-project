    "text": " Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each layer has a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...) around it. Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...), and each of those has another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s or the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)). So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + result from step 1)\n3. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on, until E9, since there are 9 layers of 3(...) after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me check: starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen the next layer out is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's E1. Then each 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost, we have:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 E1\n\nThen 3*(1 + E1) \u2192 E2\n\nThen 3*(1 + E2) \u2192 E3\n\nAnd this continues until the outermost expression. Let me count how many E's there are.\n\nThe original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me check:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1 + ...): starting from the innermost, each 3(...) is a new layer. So from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first 3(...). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...)s.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to see how many times 3(1 + ...) is nested. Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. Then inside that, another 3( \u2192 2\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is not a 3(...). So the number of 3(...) layers is 9. Because each \"3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The first 3( is the outermost layer.\n2. Then inside it, another 3( \u2192 layer 2\n3. Inside that, another 3( \u2192 layer 3\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 3(1 + 3), which would be layer 9.\n\nWait, but the innermost part is just (1 + 3), without a 3( around it. So perhaps the number of layers is 9, each being 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me verify:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(16) = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(49) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(148) = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(445) = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1336) = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(4009) = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nSo E9 would be the result of the outermost expression, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9, because each 3( adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So the expression is 3*(1 + E), where E is the entire nested part. So perhaps E is 9 layers deep.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, with each step adding a layer.\n\nLet me try to compute each step:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no. Wait, the initial expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). But in my previous step, Layer9 was 3*(1 + Layer8), which is the innermost 3*(1 + ...). Wait, I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The initial expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(1 + E9), where E9 is the result of the innermost layers.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I computed up to Layer9 as 36084, but that would be the result of the innermost layers, and the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, because the initial expression is 3*(1 + ...), where ... is the entire nested part, which is 9 layers deep.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many 3*(1 + ...) there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, after (1 + 3), each subsequent layer is a 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions.\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then the next is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nThen 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nThen 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nThen 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nThen 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, that's 8 layers after the innermost (1 + 3). So total layers including the innermost would be 9. But in my previous calculation, I had Layer1 as (1 + 3), Layer2 as 3*(1 + Layer1), up to Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8). So that would mean that the outermost expression is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), where ... is the nested part. So if the nested part is 9 layers deep, then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). But in my previous calculation, Layer9 was already the result of 3*(1 + Layer8). So perhaps I'm double-counting.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the expression is built as follows:\n\nStart with E = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen E = 3*(1 + E) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo after 9 iterations, E = 36084\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 + E), where E is the nested part. Wait, no, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + E), where E is the nested part. So in this case, after 9 iterations, E would be 36084, but the outermost expression is 3*(1 + E). Wait, but in my calculation, I already included that 3* in the 9th iteration.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define E_n as the value of the nested expression with n layers.\n\nSo E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo E_9 is 36084, which is the value of the nested part with 9 layers. But the original expression is 3*(1 + E_9). Wait, no, because E_9 is already 3*(1 + E_8), which is the outermost layer. So the original expression is E_9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo it's 3*(1 + E), where E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 8 layers. So perhaps E is E_8, which is 12027, and then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so perhaps the original expression is 3*(1 + E_8), where E_8 is 12027, making the result 36084.\n\nAlternatively, if E_9 is the result of the entire expression, then it's 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer until the outermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo after 9 layers, the result is 36084. Therefore, the original expression evaluates to 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing each step again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(16) = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(49) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(148) = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(445) = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1336) = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(4009) = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time. So the final result after 9 layers is 36084.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is following the pattern of 3*(1 + previous result), which leads to exponential growth, but since we're only doing it 9 times, it's manageable. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the calculations.\n\nLet me recompute a few steps to verify:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll steps check out. So I'm confident that the result is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Outermost: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to parse this. It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each layer seems to be 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. Let me count how many times this nesting happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. Then, moving outwards, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep the nesting is.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, I see 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. So, there are 9 layers here. That means the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that with 3*(1 + ...). So, it's like a chain of 9 layers.\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let's do that step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer as I compute it.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, no, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Right.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Right.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 + 1 =25, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 + 2=29.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression has 9 layers. But when I started, the innermost was Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. But the way the expression is written, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, the first multiplication is 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + ...). Then inside that, it's 3*(1 + ...), and so on. So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, maybe the way I counted layers is correct, with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the first term is 3*(1 + ...). So, if Layer 1 is 1+3=4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13=40, and so on until Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because in the original expression, the first term is 3*(1 + ...), so actually, Layer 1 is 1+3=4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13=40, ..., Layer 9 is 1 + 3*...=29524. But then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(...). So, if I have Layer 9 as the innermost, then the outermost would be 3*(Layer 9). But according to my previous computation, Layer 9 was 29524, so then the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in my previous computation, I was already computing each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Maybe the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841=29524. So, that's 9 layers, with Layer 9 being the innermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the first term is 3*(1 + ...). So, if Layer 1 is 1+3=4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, etc., up to Layer 9 is 1 + 3*...=29524. But then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my previous computation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, but that was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, actually, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that would make the total expression 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. In my initial computation, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8)=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times...))). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, yes, the final result is 3*(Layer 9)=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + ...). The innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n11. 1+3)\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so 9 layers in total. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 +3*13=40, Layer4:1 +3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought that the innermost was Layer1, and then each subsequent layer was the next number, up to Layer9. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n=1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n=1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1\n\nSo, B= -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 =4.\n\nPlug n=1 into the general solution:\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 =4\n\n3A=4 +1/2=9/2\n\nA= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Let me try to write this as a sum.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost part as S=1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, S1=1 +3*S=1 +12=13\n\nS2=1 +3*S1=1 +39=40\n\nS3=1 +3*S2=1 +120=121\n\nS4=1 +3*S3=1 +363=364\n\nS5=1 +3*S4=1 +1092=1093\n\nS6=1 +3*S5=1 +3279=3280\n\nS7=1 +3*S6=1 +9840=9841\n\nS8=1 +3*S7=1 +29523=29524\n\nS9=1 +3*S8=1 +88572=88573? Wait, no, that can't be right because S8=29524, so S9=1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E=3*S8=88572. So, perhaps S9 is E=88573? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the original expression, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(... S8 ... ))), so E=3*S8, where S8=29524. So, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut if I consider S9=1 +3*S8=1 +88572=88573, but that's beyond the original expression. So, E=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had Layer9=29524, which is S8. So, E=3*S8=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, E=3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series approach. All lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value using the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1 inside the next set of parentheses. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me write that down:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer is:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, that seems manageable. Let me keep going step by step.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13)\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40)\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, numbers are getting bigger. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here or if I'm just going to have to compute each layer one by one.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121)\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, right? Yes, because 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 is indeed 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364)\nLet me compute 3*364 first. 360*3 is 1080, and 4*3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, moving out another layer:\n\n1 + 3*(1093)\nFirst, 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280)\nCompute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me double-check my multiplication:\n\n3280 * 3:\n3000*3 = 9000\n200*3 = 600\n80*3 = 240\n0*3 = 0\nAdding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840, plus 0 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving on to the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841)\nCompute 3*9841 first. Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n800*3 = 2400\n40*3 = 120\n1*3 = 3\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nHmm, that's a pretty large number. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually because this might take too long.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nEach time, we have a term that's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. This seems recursive.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n...\nand so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until layer 9: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with eight 1 + 3 terms.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8), and so on.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let's compute each a\u2099 step by step up to a\u2089.\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing each layer, we get a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I had:\n\na\u2089 = 29524\n\nSo, 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check my earlier step-by-step computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\n1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\n1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\n1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\n1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\n1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\n1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\n1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a\u2089=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, when I first started computing, I was going to compute each layer manually, but then I realized it's a recursive sequence, so I modeled it as a\u2099=1+3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 with a\u2081=4, and computed up to a\u2089=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence relation is a\u2099 = c*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + d, which in this case is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 +1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3*P + 1\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1\n\n-2P = 1\n\nP = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 =4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can tackle this. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, let me write this down step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 + 3(...). So, maybe each of these can be simplified one by one. Let me start from the innermost part.\n\nLet's label each level for clarity. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost one, multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the parentheses, so maybe I should consider that as the last step.\n\nLet me try to compute each level one by one.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to Level 2, which is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, then:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Level 2 is 13. Next, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2). So, Level 3:\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, so Level 9 is 29524. But remember, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n3*(Level 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSeems like all the steps check out. So, I think my final answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a repeated pattern. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one.\n\nIf I denote a_n as the value at level n, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Maybe there's a formula for such a sequence.\n\nIn general, for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be expressed as:\n\na_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a_n = 3^{n} + something.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the outermost parentheses:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I still arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each level step by step is a reliable method, albeit a bit tedious.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. By systematically simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step until reaching the final result. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the total:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

It seems like each part of the expression is similar, so maybe there's a pattern I can use to simplify it. Let me try to work through it from the inside out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So maybe I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So Level 1 is the innermost, and Level 9 is the outermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute each level step by step, using the result from the previous level.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Hmm, let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's calculate. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let me compute this. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high.

So 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the earlier levels because maybe I made a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back through each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), and each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous level). So maybe there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to define each level as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at level n, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can compute a_n directly without computing each level.

It seems like there are multiple layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple instances of \"1+3\" multiplied by 3. It looks like each layer is adding another 1+3 inside. So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nLet me write down the expression and see how many layers there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3*(previous result)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking more carefully, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, it's like a recursive structure. Let me count the number of parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that suggests there are nine layers here. Let me confirm that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then, 1+3*(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the previous expression. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something that can be simplified with a formula.\n\nLet me try to define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built by the expression 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nUp to a\u2089, since there are nine layers inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a\u2089), right? Because the innermost is a\u2081, then a\u2082, up to a\u2089, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let me compute each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, right? Because the outermost is 3*(a\u2089).\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\n3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*29,000 = 87,000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1,572\n\nSo, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88,572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a\u2089.\n\nLet me recompute each a_i step by step:\n\na\u2081 = 1 +3=4\n\na\u2082=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\na\u2083=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\na\u2084=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\na\u2085=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\na\u2086=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\na\u2087=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\na\u2088=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\na\u2089=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, when I compute a\u2081 to a\u2089, each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the approach is right.\n\nLet's say, for example, if the expression was just 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which would be two layers.\n\nCompute that:\n\nInnermost: 1 +3=4\n\nThen, 3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39\n\nAlternatively, using the a_i approach:\n\na\u2081=4\n\na\u2082=1 +3*4=13\n\nThen, 3*a\u2082=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if it was 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))), three layers.\n\nCompute:\n\na\u2081=4\n\na\u2082=1 +3*4=13\n\na\u2083=1 +3*13=40\n\nThen, 3*a\u2083=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(1 +12))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases, so likely correct for nine layers.\n\nThus, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence where each term is built by the expression \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). Let's compute each term step by step:\n\n1. \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and that pattern repeats multiple times. I think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times something.

Next level:\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Okay.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n8. Next level:\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems correct.\n\nNext, moving out another layer:\n\n9. Next level:\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's right.\n\nAnd finally, the outermost layer:\n\n10. Next level:\n    - 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing all the inner parentheses up to 29524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, the final result should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it to see if I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula works for the first few terms. So, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, let's see:\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer because after the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3\" inside:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers n is 9, starting from a_1 up to a_9.\n\nThus, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Thus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this makes sense. Both methods, step-by-step expansion and solving the recurrence relation, lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each step follows a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence provides a closed-form expression, confirming the result obtained through iterative computation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. **Work Outwards:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous step).\n\n4. **Recognize the Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The sequence follows a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which can be solved to find a closed-form formula.\n\n5. **Apply the Formula:**\n   - Using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n = 9 (number of layers), compute the result.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Value:**\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n   - Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can parse this correctly. It seems like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3. Since it's nested so many times, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can handle each layer one at a time without getting confused.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer, maybe numbering each layer as I go. So starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this process until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nI think there are nine layers here because each time we add another (1 + 3(...)), and the original problem has nine sets of parentheses after the first 3. Let me check that.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: there are nine closing parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So that means we have nine layers to compute.\n\nWait, but actually, the first term is 3*(...), and inside that, there are eight more layers. Let me clarify:\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each step adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me list each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nStep 2: Use that result in the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\n\nStep 3: Use the result from Step 2 in the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Step 9, which will be the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. So, after computing the ninth layer, I'll multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nLet me start computing each step.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step 9 result). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each step again quickly:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Let me verify one more time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each step seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we can write this as a recurrence:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the initial steps:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth term a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000 \u2192 60,000+27,000=87,000\n\n500*3=1,500 \u2192 87,000+1,500=88,500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88,500+60=88,560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88,560+12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nExpanding this recursively:\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*(1 +3*4)=1 +3 +9*4=1 +3 +36=40\n\nWait, but actually, that's not the most efficient way. Alternatively, using the recurrence, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, which we've already solved, so perhaps it's better to stick with the closed-form.\n\nIn any case, all methods point to the final result being 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it step by step again, in case I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me list each step with the result:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nStep 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nStep7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nStep8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nStep9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each step using another method, like adding 3 each time multiplied by powers of 3.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the expression as a sum of terms multiplied by powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, each 1 contributes a term multiplied by 3^{n} where n is the number of layers it's been multiplied by.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a sum.\n\nLet me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 +3) =1 +3 +9\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27\n\nContinuing this way, each Lk adds another term which is 3^k.\n\nWait, so in general, Lk = 1 +3*(Lk-1), which expands to 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )).\n\nSo, expanding Lk, it's 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{k}.\n\nWait, that seems like a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me check for k=1: L1=1+3=4=1+3= sum of 3^0 +3^1=1+3=4.\n\nk=2: L2=1 +3*(1 +3)=1+3+9=13=1+3+9= sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2=13.\n\nk=3: L3=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1+3+9+27=40= sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=40.\n\nYes, so in general, Lk= sum from i=0 to k of 3^i.\n\nBut wait, in our case, we have L1 up to L9, but actually, the outermost layer is L9, which would be sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is sum from i=0 to 9 of 3^i.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, a_9=29524, which is equal to (3^{10}-1)/2, which is indeed the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^9.\n\nBecause sum from i=0 to n of 3^i = (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, sum from i=0 to9 of3^i=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple times using different methods: step-by-step computation, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me see. It's a nested expression with multiple layers of 3s and 1s. It looks like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So, maybe I can work from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That seems like a good strategy because each step depends on the previous one, and if I go from the inside out, I can compute each part step by step without getting lost.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly, maybe labeling each layer to keep track. Let's number the innermost part as layer 1, then the next one as layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9, since there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Hmm, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's nine, right? So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, and going out to layer 9.\n\nSo, let me define each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen, layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, starting from the innermost, which is the last one: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet's start from the innermost expression, which is the last one: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + Layer1). So, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let me list each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, does that mean that the outermost layer is also multiplied by 3? Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, if I compute the innermost part, layer1 is 1+3=4, layer2 is 3*(1+4)=15, layer3 is 3*(1+15)=48, and so on until layer9, which is 3*(1 + layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, it's like 3*(1 + (layer9)), where layer9 is 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I have to go up to layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, that can't be, because in the original expression, the outermost 3 is already multiplied by (1 + ...). So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from layer1 as 1+3=4, layer2 as 3*(1+4)=15, and so on, up to layer9, which would be 3*(1 + layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, but that would be 3*(1 + layer9), which would be layer10? Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s: starting from the outermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each 3 is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, after computing layer9 as 36084, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084). Wait, no, because the outermost 3 is already multiplied by (1 + ...). So, perhaps I have to compute one more layer.\n\nWait, let me check. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, layer1: 1+3=4\n\nlayer2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nlayer3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nlayer4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nlayer5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nlayer6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nlayer7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nlayer8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nlayer9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 + layer9). Wait, no, because the outermost 3 is already part of the expression. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9). But layer9 is 3*(1 + layer8). So, let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to compute layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9). So, layer9 is 36084, so 1 + layer9 is 36085, then 3*36085.\n\nWait, that would be 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, because in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(1 + Layer9). So, Layer9 is the innermost part, and then the outermost part is 3*(1 + Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, Layer9 is 3*(1 + Layer8). So, Layer9 is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, but that would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nBut let me check: in the original expression, is the outermost 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), where ... is the entire inner expression. So, yes, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + inner expression). So, the inner expression is up to Layer9, which is 36084, so 1 + 36084 = 36085, then 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to Layer9 as 36084, which is the result of 3*(1 + Layer8). So, if the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9), which is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... ) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, 3*(1 + 3) is 12, but earlier I thought it was 1 + 3 =4, then 3*4=12. Wait, no, in my earlier approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe I have to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 =4. Then, layer2 is 3*(1 +4)=15. Then layer3 is 3*(1 +15)=48, etc.\n\nSo, let's list them again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 +4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2)=3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3)=3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4)=3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5)=3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6)=3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7)=3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)=3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(1 + Layer9). So, Layer9 is 36084, so 1 + 36084 =36085, then 3*36085=108,255.\n\nBut wait, let me check: if I compute layer9 as 36084, then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 36084)=108,255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, layer1 is 3*(1 +3)=12, layer2 is 3*(1 +12)=39, layer3 is 3*(1 +39)=120, and so on. Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3=4.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:3*(1 +4)=15\n\nLayer3:3*(1 +15)=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1 +48)=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1 +147)=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1 +444)=1335\n\nLayer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\nLayer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\nLayer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9)=3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nWait, but in this case, the outermost 3 is multiplying (1 + Layer9). So, Layer9 is 36084, so 1 +36084=36085, then 3*36085=108,255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, in that case, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 1 +3=4.\n\nSo, in that case, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from 1 +3=4, then 3*(1 +4)=15, etc., up to layer9=3*(1 + layer8)=36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9)=3*(1 +36084)=108,255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outermost 3 is already included in the count, so we have 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...), starting from 1 +3=4.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the first layer is 3*(1 +3)=12, but that doesn't seem right because the innermost is 1 +3=4, then the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: 1 +3=4\n\nNext layer:3*(1 +4)=15\n\nNext:3*(1 +15)=48\n\nNext:3*(1 +48)=147\n\nNext:3*(1 +147)=444\n\nNext:3*(1 +444)=1335\n\nNext:3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\nNext:3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\nNext:3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost 3 is already multiplying (1 + ...), so we don't need to add another layer. Let me check.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 +3=4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, as above, layer2=15, layer3=48,... up to layer9=36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9)=3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it in a different way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think: each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 1 +3=4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me write it as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} +3\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p =3*a_p +3\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p -3a_p =3\n\n-2a_p=3\n\na_p= -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1=4\n\nSo, 4= C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4=3C -3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 =3C\n\nWhich is 11/2=3C\n\nThus, C=11/(2*3)=11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n=(11/6)*3^n -3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let me check for n=1:\n\na_1= (11/6)*3^1 -3/2= (33/6) - 3/2= (11/2) - (3/2)=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2= (11/6)*3^2 -3/2= (11/6)*9 -3/2= 99/6 -3/2= 33/2 -3/2=30/2=15, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(11/6)*3^9 -3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9=(11/6)*19683 -3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f76=3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 *11=3280.5*10 +3280.5*1=32805 +3280.5=36085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2=1.5\n\nSo, a_9=36085.5 -1.5=36084\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=36084, which is the result after 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nBut wait, in the formula, a_n is defined as the result after n layers, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, in the original problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=36084, then the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outermost 3 is already included in the layers, so maybe the total number of layers is 10? Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplying (1 + ...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the total layers are 9, with the outermost 3 being the 10th layer. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:3*(1 +4)=15\n\nLayer3:3*(1 +15)=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1 +48)=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1 +147)=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1 +444)=1335\n\nLayer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\nLayer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\nLayer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108,255.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n=(11/6)*3^n -3/2, with n=9, we get a_9=36084, then the entire expression is 3*(1 +36084)=108,255.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108,255.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 3*(1 + ...).

Each one seems to have a 1 plus 3 times something. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the left, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So maybe I can work from the inside out, calculating each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write this out step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are.

Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(result from 1)\n3. 1+3*(result from 2)\n4. 1+3*(result from 3)\n5. 1+3*(result from 4)\n6. 1+3*(result from 5)\n7. 1+3*(result from 6)\n8. 1+3*(result from 7)\n9. 1+3*(result from 8)\n10.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each layer as L1 to L9, then the final result is 3*(L9).\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So after computing L9, which is 29524, then the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a very large number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's see: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo L9 is 29524. Then the final result is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 L1\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 1+3 adds a new layer.\n\nWait, the problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each layer is wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times we have 1+3(...).\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is followed by another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3*(innermost)\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3*(previous), and so on.\n\nEach time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one until the ninth layer, and then it's multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but when I calculated L1 through L9, each L corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost as L1, then L2, up to L9, and then the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe initial expression is 3(1+3(...)). Then, each time we have a new (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern (1+3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nEach time, we add another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first (1+3) is at position 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3\n2. (1+3(1+3\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3\n...\nContinuing until the ninth opening parenthesis, I think. Wait, let me count.\n\nEach time we have a new (1+3(...), so let's see:\n\n- After 3(, the first ( is at position 1: 3(1+3(...))\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's the second layer.\n- Continuing, each time we have a new (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the problem, after the initial 3(, each subsequent (1+3 starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of the first innermost (1+3(...))\n2. Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, how many times do we have a new ( before we reach the innermost (1+3)?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3( occurs.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time we have 1+3(, which starts a new layer. Let's count how many times 1+3( occurs.\n\n1. After 3(, we have 1+3(, that's the first occurrence.\n2. Then, inside that, another 1+3(, that's the second.\n3. And so on, until the ninth occurrence.\n\nWait, let me check: from the problem, after 3(, each 1+3( adds a new layer. So, how many 1+3( are there?\n\nLet me parse the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after 3(, the number of 1+3( is 9 times, because each (1+3( is a new layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, each (1+3( adds a new layer, but the innermost is just (1+3), without another (1+3( inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time we have a (1+3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( adds a new layer. So, how many times does (1+3( occur?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3( in the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( is:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would mean we have 9 layers, each starting with (1+3(, but the innermost one is just (1+3). So, actually, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had L1 to L9, which matched this count. So, the final result is 3*(L9), which we calculated as 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of L9. Let me recompute L9 step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7         3\n\n------------\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1+3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1+3(...)), where the ... was the innermost part we just computed. Let me substitute that 4 in.\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4):\n   - First, compute 3*4: 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another level, the expression is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13):\n   - 3 * 13 = 39\n   - 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo now, the next layer is 40. Continuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*40). Let me calculate that.\n\n4. Compute (1 + 3*40):\n   - 3 * 40 = 120\n   - 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, so that layer gives me 121. Moving out another step, the expression becomes (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that.\n\n5. Compute (1 + 3*121):\n   - 3 * 121 = 363\n   - 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, that's 364. Now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*364). Let me figure that out.\n\n6. Compute (1 + 3*364):\n   - 3 * 364 = 1092\n   - 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, so that layer is 1093. Continuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute that.\n\n7. Compute (1 + 3*1093):\n   - 3 * 1093 = 3279\n   - 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, now we're at 3280. Moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*3280). Let me calculate that.\n\n8. Compute (1 + 3*3280):\n   - 3 * 3280 = 9840\n   - 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, that gives me 9841. Next layer out is (1 + 3*9841). Let me work that out.\n\n9. Compute (1 + 3*9841):\n   - 3 * 9841 = 29523\n   - 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, moving out another level, the expression is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that.\n\n10. Compute (1 + 3*29524):\n    - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n    - 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nAlright, so that layer is 88573. Finally, moving out to the outermost parentheses, we have (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute that last part.\n\n11. Compute (1 + 3*88573):\n    - 3 * 88573 = 265719\n    - 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nSo, now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 265720. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by that entire expression. So, I need to compute 3 * 265720.\n\n12. Compute 3 * 265720:\n    - 3 * 265720 = 797160\n\nHmm, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 265720\n12. 3 * 265720 = 797160\n\nWait a second, that seems correct. Each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me verify one of the steps where I might have gone wrong. Let's pick step 5:\n\n(1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*265720 = 797160. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this expression in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nThis looks like a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. There are 9 layers of nesting, so perhaps 9 terms?\n\nWait, let's count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost, we have 9 instances where it's 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe this is a geometric series with 9 terms where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me think. If I denote each step as a term, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, perhaps I can compute a_9 more efficiently.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWait, but earlier, when computing step by step, a_9 was 29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, that's conflicting with my previous result of 797160.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the result of the 9 nested 1 + 3*(...) expressions.\n\nIn my step-by-step computation, I had 9 layers inside, each 1 + 3*(previous), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nBut in the recurrence, I defined a_n as the result after n layers, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_9 is the result after 9 layers, which is 29524.\n\nBut in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step computation, I went up to 11 steps, computing up to 265720 and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me recount the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions in the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). Therefore, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that. Let me see.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I started with (1+3) = 4, then each step was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 9 steps to get to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I went beyond that, getting 265720 and then multiplying by 3 to get 797160. That must be wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps I misapplied the number of layers. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the original problem, after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, that's 9 layers. Thus, a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I had 11 steps, which would imply 11 layers. That must be incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the original problem.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n11. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...) after the initial 3(.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3(, that's one.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, from the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's:\n\n3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3( (1+3)))))))))))))\n\nSo, each ( after the initial 3( is a new layer. So, starting from 3(, the first ( is the innermost, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3\n2. (1+3\n3. (1+3\n4. (1+3\n5. (1+3\n6. (1+3\n7. (1+3\n8. (1+3\n9. (1+3\n10. (1+3\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me look again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( A ), where A is:\n\n1+3( B ), where B is:\n\n1+3( C ), where C is:\n\n... and so on, until the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside, each being (1+3*(previous layer)), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, getting to 265720 and then multiplying by 3 to get 797160. That must be incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me see. In my initial computation, I had 11 steps, which would imply 11 layers, but the problem only has 9 layers inside the 3*(...). So, I must have miscounted.\n\nLet me try again, this time being careful with the number of layers.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer:\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I went two layers beyond, which was incorrect. I think I miscounted the number of layers, thinking there were 11 instead of 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTo confirm, let's use the formula we derived earlier:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's 88572.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result through both step-by-step computation and mathematical derivation.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form (1 + 3*(previous term)). There are 9 such nested terms inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Sequence**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value after n layers of nesting. The recurrence relation is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence relation is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute \\( a_9 \\)**: Substituting \\( n = 9 \\), we get \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, I can work my way outwards. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I should start from the innermost and work my way out, substituting each step.\n\nLet me try to write each step as I go along. Let's number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are nine layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Finally: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but each step I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but I think I might be miscounting the number of layers. Let me check again. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me list each step clearly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3? Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Then, after the innermost 9 layers, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, if I have 9 layers, then the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...). So, let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3(, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 3(, meaning that the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, that means there are 9 layers of 3*(...), each time adding 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 9 layers, ending up with 29524, which would be the result of Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because each layer is 3*(...), so the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, but that was after 9 layers. So, perhaps I need to multiply by 3 again at the end.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, but perhaps that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 +27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a counting error.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I expand it, maybe it's a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's consider the expression starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nBut using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step calculation and the formula.\n\nWait, but let me check again the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent 3*(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is nested inside. So, the number of 3( is 9, as each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, that would mean that a_9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*(a_9).\n\nWait, but in my formula, a_n is the value after n layers, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step, just to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 3^10 - 3^9 + ... but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the depth.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach since it's manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*a.\n\nSo, with 9 layers, the value at each layer can be computed as:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, the result is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to parse this. It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. Maybe it's a repeating pattern or something that can be simplified by working from the inside out.\n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the innermost part and work my way outward. Let's see, the innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer separately to keep track. I'll number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9, maybe? Let's check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Hmm, actually, looking again, the problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost, so Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go step by step, maybe writing each layer down:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each subsequent one adds a layer. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so 3*(Layer9). So, my previous calculation was correct, resulting in 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as geometric series or using recursion.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the recursive formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nAlright, I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost layer and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It's like a chain of expressions where each one is inside another. Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually seems to work with nested expressions.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I understand the structure:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). The \"something\" itself is another similar expression. It seems like this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times the 3 is being multiplied in each part.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(innermost result)). So, substituting the innermost result:\n\nNext level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, the expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, each step involves taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: (1 + 3*Level9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait a second, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time moving out, so how many levels are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the 9th level? Wait, no, let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied by something. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, how many such multiplications are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 3*(1 + 13) = 3*14 = 42, then add 1: 1 + 42 = 43\nWait, no, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the structure is each time, the expression is (1 + 3*(previous expression)). So, each level is (1 + 3*previous level). So, starting from level 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen level 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nLevel 10: (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, the number of levels is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let's count:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's another level. Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a new (1+3(...)), that's a new level. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th level.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have (1 + 3 * previous result).\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*Level1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*Level2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*Level3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*Level4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*Level5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*Level6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*Level7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*Level8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: (1 + 3*Level9) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the 9th level? Or is it 8 levels?\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 3s after the first one. Let me see:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 3*(1+3), then each time moving outward, adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of times we have 3* is equal to the number of levels.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 3s after the first one. Each time, there's a 3* before the next (1 + ...). So, in the innermost, it's 3*(1+3). Then moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each level adds another 3*.\n\nSo, how many 3*s are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1+3) \u2192 1\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 2\n\nContinuing until the outermost, which is the 9th level.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of levels is equal to the number of times we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of the next level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then moving out, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, how many such 3*s are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, we have:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 that's the first 3 after the initial 3.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on, until we have 9 levels.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of 3s after the first one. Each time, the structure is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 3*(1+3), then each level adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3s after the first one is 8, because the innermost is the first 3 after the initial one, and then each level adds another.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider that each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), that's a new level. So, starting from the innermost, which is 3*(1+3), that's level 1.\n\nThen, moving out, the next level is 3*(1 + 3*(level1)), which is level2.\n\nContinuing this way, the outermost level is level9.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 levels, each corresponding to a 3*(1 + ...).\n\nTherefore, I should compute from level1 to level9.\n\nSo, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel2: (1 + 3*Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: (1 + 3*Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: (1 + 3*Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: (1 + 3*Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: (1 + 3*Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: (1 + 3*Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: (1 + 3*Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: (1 + 3*Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing up to level9, the result is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(level9). Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is level9.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to level9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach level is defined by Level n = 1 + 3*Level(n-1), starting from Level1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nLevel n = a*3^n + b\n\nWe can solve for a and b.\n\nGiven Level1 = 4, Level2 = 13, etc.\n\nSo, let's assume Level n = a*3^n + b\n\nThen, Level1 = a*3^1 + b = 3a + b = 4\n\nLevel2 = a*3^2 + b = 9a + b = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(9a + b) - (3a + b) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6a = 9 \u2192 a = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nThen, substituting back into Level1:\n\n3*(3/2) + b = 4 \u2192 9/2 + b = 4 \u2192 b = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2\n\nSo, the general formula is Level n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Level n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Level9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Level9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I expand this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^n, but I need to be careful with the exact structure.\n\nWait, actually, each term is multiplied by 3, but the way it's nested might lead to a different sum.\n\nBut since I already have the result from the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each level step by step and verifying with a different method, I conclude that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as (1 + 3 * previous level). Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent level is calculated until reaching the outermost level, which is then multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next level: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next level: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next level: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next level: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next level: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next level: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, so it's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each part seems to be 1 plus 3 times something, and then multiplied by 3 again. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up from the inside out. That is, the innermost part is (1+3), and each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nHmm, that's nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nL2: 1 + 3(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3(L2)\n\n...\n\nUp to L9: 1 + 3(L8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3(L9).\n\nSo, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from L1.\n\nLet me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, L2 is 1 + 3(L1), which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute L2:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, L2 = 13\n\nNext, L3 is 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, L3 = 40\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, L4 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, L6 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, L7 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, L8 = 9841\n\nFinally, L9: 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3(L9), so we need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from L1 to L9, each step seemed correct, but let me verify L9:\n\nL9 is 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a certain progression. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nL2 = 13, which is 3*4 +1 = 13, correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes.\n\nSimilarly, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L1=4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula holds for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could also note that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps there's a way to express this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nBut in this case, since each layer is built on the previous one, the recursive approach or the closed-form formula seems the most straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing L9 using the formula and then multiplying by 3.\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing that the expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\), where each \\( L_i \\) is computed as \\( 1 + 3 \\times L_{i-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe also verified the result using a closed-form formula derived from the recursive sequence, confirming the result is consistent.\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The innermost one is \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the next layer out is \"1 + 3*(result from innermost)\". Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So starting from the innermost, each step involves computing 1 + 3*(something), and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but actually, looking again, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive expression, where each step depends on the next one.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So actually, the innermost part is the first \"1 + 3\", then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me try to write this down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) would be the innermost expression, and f(8) would be the outermost, since I count 8 layers of parentheses. Let me check that.\n\nWait, looking at the original expression: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3\" is followed by another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, (1+3*(...))\n3. So each time, it's another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, (1+3*(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until we have 8 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + 3*(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see:\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until we have 8 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 2 layers\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 3 layers\n...\nContinuing until we have 8 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 1 layer. Then each time we wrap it with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's another layer. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...) occurs is 8 times. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 layer 3\n...\nUp to layer 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me define each step as f(n), where n is the number of layers. So:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each f(n) is defined as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), where f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)), which is 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps Layer2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)).\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, starting from Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that last step.\n\nSo, Layer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054)\n\nFirst, compute 3*2325054:\n\n2325054 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 2325054 * 3:\n\n2,325,054 * 3:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n\n325,054 * 3:\n\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\n\n25,054 * 3 = 75,162\n\nSo, 900,000 + 75,162 = 975,162\n\nThen, 6,000,000 + 975,162 = 6,975,162\n\nSo, 3*2325054 = 6,975,162\n\nThen, add 1: 6,975,162 + 1 = 6,975,163\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3 * 6,975,163\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6,975,163 * 3:\n\nFirst, 6,000,000 * 3 = 18,000,000\n\n975,163 * 3:\n\n900,000 * 3 = 2,700,000\n\n75,163 * 3:\n\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n\n5,163 * 3 = 15,489\n\nSo, 210,000 + 15,489 = 225,489\n\nThen, 2,700,000 + 225,489 = 2,925,489\n\nNow, add that to 18,000,000:\n\n18,000,000 + 2,925,489 = 20,925,489\n\nSo, Layer8 is 20,925,489\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication for Layer8:\n\n6,975,163 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 6,975,163 * 3:\n\n6,000,000 * 3 = 18,000,000\n\n975,163 * 3:\n\n900,000 * 3 = 2,700,000\n\n75,163 * 3:\n\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n\n5,163 * 3 = 15,489\n\nSo, 210,000 + 15,489 = 225,489\n\n2,700,000 + 225,489 = 2,925,489\n\n18,000,000 + 2,925,489 = 20,925,489\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result after computing all 8 layers is 20,925,489.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer1\n2. 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 layer2\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 layer3\n...\nContinuing until layer8.\n\nYes, so 8 layers in total. So, the final result is 20,925,489.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous layers.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(13)=39 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(118)=354 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354)=3*(1063)=3189 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189)=3*(9568)=28704 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704)=3*(86113)=258,339 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339)=3*(775,018)=2,325,054 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054)=3*(6,975,163)=20,925,489 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out.

Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of multiplications and additions, all nested within each other. It seems like each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write this out step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from above)). Let me compute that next.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, inside the second layer, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). The innermost result was 4, so 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is indeed 13.\n\nOkay, moving out another layer, it's again 3*(previous result) + 1. Hmm, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So maybe I should think of each step as computing 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step clearly.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers of 3*(...), so maybe I can compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression and work my way out.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nBut actually, when I look at the problem, it's:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is S1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + S1). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + the next layer). So starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to write this down.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s compute from the inside out:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 3*(1 + result from Step 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index each layer. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the problem, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nBut actually, the innermost is L9, and the outermost is L1. Wait, no, perhaps I should number them from the inside out.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start with the innermost and compute each layer outward.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nCompute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, in the problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So the next layer out is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), which would be 3*(1 + 4) = 15, as I did.\n\nThen the next layer out would be 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5.

Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot of layers. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) is applied.\n\nLooking at the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the initial 3, there are 8 more layers, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, so 8 times we have 3*(1 + ...). So let me try that approach.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I ended up with 36084 as the result after 9 layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1 to the previous result. So the final result would be 36084.\n\nBut let me check again, because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's list each step:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1 to the previous result.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there are 8 more layers, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time there's a new (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, including the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 3s multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So the number of 3s is 9, meaning 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 9 layers and the result was 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct, but let me verify with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a smaller version of the problem to test my method.\n\nSuppose I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nSo, the result is 48.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier step-by-step. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, hold on, that's conflicting. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, I have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nBut when I compute directly, I get 120.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses first:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWait, but when I compute the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so my step-by-step approach gave me 48, but the actual computation gives 120. That means I must have made a mistake in how I'm applying the layers.\n\nWait, so perhaps my method of computing each layer as 3*(1 + previous) is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the smaller example, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the next layer is 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40, then 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, each layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40, then 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I was treating each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but in reality, it's 1 + 3*(previous) at each step, except for the outermost layer, which is 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn the original problem, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...), except for the very innermost, which is just (1 + 3).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nStart with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that's not the case.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, after the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but when computed directly, it's 120, so that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me write the smaller example again.\n\nWait, the smaller example is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nBut when I compute directly, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so that suggests that my step-by-step approach is wrong because I'm not correctly handling the nesting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach it differently. Let me try to compute the smaller example correctly.\n\nLet me compute the smaller example step by step:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 15 = 16.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then that 15 is inside another 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and then that 48 is inside the outermost 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Wait, but that's not matching the direct computation.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the smaller example, the structure is only three layers: outermost 3*(1 + ...), then inside that is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that is (1 + 3). So, perhaps my earlier approach was correct, but the direct computation was wrong.\n\nWait, no, let me do it again.\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, compute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but when I computed it directly earlier, I got 120. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direct computation.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from the step-by-step approach, which gave me 147. So, clearly, there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parenthesize the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nLet me compute the innermost parentheses first: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 15 = 16.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), so after computing the innermost, the next step is to compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, that 15 is inside another 3*(1 + ...), so 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So, then, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get 120. So, I must be making a mistake in how I'm handling the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write the expression with more parentheses to clarify:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, it's 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the direct computation which gave me 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the parentheses. Let me compute it correctly step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, compute the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get 120, so there must be a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not handling the parentheses correctly. Let me compute it without step-by-step.\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, compute 1 + 15 = 16.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the next layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing 3*(1 + 4) = 15, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but when I compute it directly, I get 120, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + (3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, compute 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, compute 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut when I compute directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so this is conflicting. There must be a mistake in how I'm handling the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the expression, each layer after the initial 3 is 3*(1 + ...), so in the smaller example, it's three layers:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich breaks down as:\n\n- Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n- Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n- Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n- Outermost layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get 120, which suggests that perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more parentheses to clarify.\n\nCompute:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (3*(1 + 3))))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (3*4)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3*(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, not 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then it's multiplied by 3 in the next layer.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Then, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Then, compute 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is only three layers, so the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Compute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. Outermost layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get 120. So, perhaps I'm misapplying the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the expression, after the first 3*(1 + ...), the next layer is 3*(1 + ...), but perhaps I'm not accounting for the correct nesting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute from the inside out:\n\nStart with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but that's four layers, but the expression only has three layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is three layers after the initial 3.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Compute 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. Compute 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but that's four layers, which doesn't match the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me define the expression recursively.\n\nLet\u2019s denote f(n) as the expression with n layers.\n\nSo, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the expression is f(3) = 120, which matches the direct computation.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I was not correctly defining the layers. Let me try this recursive approach.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the expression has 9 layers after the initial 3, so f(9).\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n from 1 to 9.\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279.\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840.\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so according to this recursive approach, f(9) is 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step from the inside out, I got 36,084, which is different.\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nLet me check with the smaller example again.\n\nUsing the recursive approach, f(3) is 120, which matches the direct computation.\n\nBut when I computed step by step from the inside out earlier, I got 147, which was wrong. So, the recursive approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, which is f(9), the result would be 88,572.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I was not properly accounting for the layers.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the original problem using this recursive approach.\n\nSo, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363.\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092.\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279.\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840.\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523.\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried to compute from the inside out without using recursion, I got 36,084, which is different.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I was not correctly handling the layers.

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times something in parentheses. Each of those parentheses starts with 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, and this pattern repeats several times. Let me count how many times the 3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). Then each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))\n...\nI think there are 9 sets of parentheses here because the innermost is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, starting from the inside, there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of 3(...) sections. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then it's 3*(1 + that)\n3. Then 3*(1 + previous)\n...\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts. Let's see, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many 3*(...) are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the initial 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. Let's count the number of 3s after the first one. Hmm, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3 (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times 3 is followed by a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(...)\n2. 3(...)\n3. 3(...)\n4. 3(...)\n5. 3(...)\n6. 3(...)\n7. 3(...)\n8. 3(...)\n9. 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), and each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + ...), and this happens 9 times. So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards, step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by adding another layer. Let me denote:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089). Because each layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let me define a sequence where each term is built as follows:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(a\u2089). So, the final result would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step by step because I might have made a mistake in counting the number of layers or in the calculations.\n\nLet me start again, this time more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(a\u2081) = 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this a\u2082 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 3*(a\u2082) = 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, a\u2083 = 40.\n\nNext: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. So, a\u2084 = 121.\n\nThen: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364. So, a\u2085 = 364.\n\nNext: 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093. a\u2086 = 1093.\n\nThen: 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280. a\u2087 = 3280.\n\nNext: 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841. a\u2088 = 9841.\n\nNext: 3*9841 = 29523, 1 + 29523 = 29524. a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(a\u2089) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) sections.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1+3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3)))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 3*(1 + ...) appears. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. Let me count the number of 3*(...) instances.\n\nLet me write it out with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\n...\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see that the number of layers is 9. Because the innermost is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3*(1+...), and the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, which means we have 9 terms in the sequence a\u2081 to a\u2089 as I defined earlier.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nAfter the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers, meaning a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Each step was computed correctly, leading to a\u2089 = 29524, and then the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the expression step by step, writing out each layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(4) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 3*(13) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(40) = 120; 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(121) = 363; 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 3*(364) = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1093) = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 3*(3280) = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*(9841) = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I had before. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this as a geometric series, but given that each step is defined by a recurrence relation, perhaps it's more straightforward to compute each term step by step, as I did.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\na\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\nwith a\u2081 = 4\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\na\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus,\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3/2)*3\u207f = (3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nThus, for n=9,\n\na\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a\u2089 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've computed it step by step, checked each arithmetic operation, and even derived a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is built by the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost term:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like a chain of operations. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer one by one. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n- Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result).\n- So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9 because I see nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is enclosed within another set of parentheses. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let's see: each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each time we go deeper, another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Let me confirm by counting the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time we have a new layer, it's a new \"1 + 3(\". So from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", so up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). So the number of layers is 9, meaning we have 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n- The first innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm by counting the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Each time you see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so:\n\n3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, which can be expressed as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the step-by-step computation I did earlier. Each layer's value was correct, so the final result should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it another way to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as building a geometric series.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence solution since it's straightforward and matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost term propagates outward, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**  \n   \\( L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Layer L2:**  \n   \\( L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Layer L3:**  \n   \\( L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Layer L4:**  \n   \\( L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Layer L5:**  \n   \\( L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Layer L6:**  \n   \\( L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Layer L7:**  \n   \\( L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Layer L8:**  \n   \\( L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Layer L9:**  \n   \\( L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n10. **Final Result:**  \n    Multiply the outermost term by 3:  \n    \\( 3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each level seems to be 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). So, it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer, maybe by labeling each layer. Let's see, starting from the innermost part:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, I think there are nine layers here. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, I think there are nine layers here, each time adding another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. That sounds manageable.\n\nLet me start by computing Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's do 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check the Layer 9 calculation again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, which is correct.\n\nAnd then 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part seems to be (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since we've computed the innermost part, let's substitute that value in. So the next level is:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(result from Level 1)\n\nBut wait, Level 1 was 4, so plugging that in:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so Level 2 gives me 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from Level 2)). Let's compute that:\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going. Next level:\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(result from Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWow, this is increasing quickly. I need to remember to take it step by step. Next level:\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(result from Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, so Level 5 is 364. Moving out another layer:\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(result from Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThat's a big number. Let's keep going:\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(result from Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, that's massive. Next level:\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(result from Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, so Level 8 is 9841. One more layer out:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(result from Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nAnd finally, the outermost layer:\n\nLevel 10: 3*(result from Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So starting from the innermost, each step I multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me recount each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. So the final result is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation.\n\nWait a second, this expression looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It's like a repeated multiplication and addition.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2, a3, etc., up to a9, since there are nine levels of nesting before the outermost 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive multiplication and addition. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 13\n\na3 = 40\n\na4 = 121\n\na5 = 364\n\na6 = 1093\n\na7 = 3280\n\na8 = 9841\n\na9 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So the recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nWith a1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, the recurrence starts at a1, not a0. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nLet me consider a0 as the term before a1. So, if a1 = 4, then a0 would be undefined in our original problem, but perhaps we can still use the formula.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, for n >= 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have a9, since the innermost is a1, and we go out 9 times, so the outermost is a9.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88572\n\nSo, both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation, we get the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start from the innermost parentheses and move outwards step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Outermost level: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nWe can also verify this using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). The general solution for this recurrence is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(a_9\\):\n\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I think I need to compute this starting from the innermost and moving outwards step by step.\n\nLet me try to write each step down.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nS1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by (this S9). So, the entire expression is 3*(S9). So, let me compute that.\n\nTotal = 3 * S9 = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go back through each S1 to S9.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, total = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for S_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nAssume S_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition S1 = 4.\n\nS1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nS_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, S9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each step as \\( S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots, S_9 \\), where each \\( S_i \\) is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( S_9 = 1 + 3 \\times S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times S_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a nested expression where each part is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 3(1 + ...) terms, and each one is nested inside the previous one.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it becomes 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n\n3. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nI think there are nine layers here because I count nine sets of parentheses. Let me confirm that. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...)\n- So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), and since there are nine opening parentheses before the first 1, that means nine layers.\n\nSo, I can approach this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way outwards, computing each step as I go.\n\nLet me list each step from 1 to 9, where each step corresponds to one layer.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression.\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\n**Step 2:** Next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Step 3:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2).\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Step 4:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 3).\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Step 5:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 4).\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Step 6:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 5).\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Step 7:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 6).\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Step 8:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 7).\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Step 9:** Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 8).\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each layer is inside another, so each time I see a \"1+\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers, each corresponding to one step as I did above. So, after Step 9, the result is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the problem is 3 times that entire expression, right? Let me look again:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. But in my steps above, I computed the nested expression as 29524. So, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested part. So, the nested part itself, as I computed, is 29524, so the total would be 3*29524.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me check my steps again. Because in each step, I was computing each layer as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, when I got to Step 9, that was the result of the innermost expression, right? Or was it?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, in my earlier steps, I computed each layer correctly, starting from the innermost, so that after nine layers, I have the value inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, after nine layers, the value inside is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to Step 9 as 29524, which is the result inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer adds 1 + 3*previous. So, after nine layers, the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524.\n\nSo, that 29524 is the value of the entire nested expression inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the total value is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me go through each step again to confirm.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the nested expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous value). So, if I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the nested expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the different methods all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the nested expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I think the key is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1+3\". That seems straightforward enough. So, let's compute that first.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, actually, let me check that. The next layer out is 1 + 3 times (the innermost result). So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after computing the first innermost part, which is 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, let's compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. The next layer is again 1 + 3 times the current result.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, that's jumping up quickly. Let's see if I can keep track of this. Next layer:\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWow, okay, that's a big number. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Maybe I should write each step separately to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has multiple layers of 1+3(...). Let me count them to ensure I don't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result8)\n\nWait, so there are nine layers in total. So, I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Now, the original problem is:\n\n3*(result of layer 9)\n\nSo, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I can compute it another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the computation is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) = 88572\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems accurate. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost value by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see if I can tackle this systematically. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer one by one without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1+3\". So, I'll start there.\n\nFirst layer:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \"1 + 3( ... )\", where the ... is the result we just got, which is 4.\n\nSecond layer:\n1 + 3(4)\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that simplifies to 13.\n\nThird layer:\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3(...)\", where the ... is now 13.\n\nSo, 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40.\n\nFourth layer:\nContinuing outward, the next layer is \"1 + 3(...)\", with ... being 40.\n\n3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nFifth layer:\nNext, \"1 + 3(...)\" where ... is 121.\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that calculation. 121 times 3 is 363, right? Because 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSixth layer:\nMoving out, the next expression is \"1 + 3(...)\" with ... now being 364.\n\n3 times 364... Hmm, let me compute that. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1 to get 1093.\n\nSeventh layer:\nNext up is \"1 + 3(...)\" where the previous result is 1093.\n\n3 times 1093... Let's see, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1 to get 3280.\n\nEighth layer:\nNow, the expression is \"1 + 3(...)\" with the previous result being 3280.\n\n3 times 3280. Let's break it down: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1 to get 9841.\n\nNinth layer:\nContinuing outward, the next expression is \"1 + 3(...)\" with the result from the previous step being 9841.\n\n3 times 9841... Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step. 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1 to get 29524.\n\nTenth layer:\nFinally, the outermost expression is \"3(...)\", where the inner part is 29524.\n\nSo, 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 multiplied by 3:\n\n- 4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 times 3 is 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 times 3 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, actually, that seems like I'm making a mistake in the digit places. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, that gives me 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe using distributive property.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check each step again to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 3\u00d74 = 12, 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 3\u00d713 = 39, 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 3\u00d740 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 3\u00d7121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 3\u00d7364: Let's compute 364\u00d73. 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 3\u00d71093: Let's compute 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 3\u00d73280: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 3\u00d79841: Let's compute 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3\u00d729524: As before, 29524\u00d73=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially in the multiplication steps. Let me verify a couple more times.\n\nFor example, step 5: 3\u00d7121=363. 121\u00d73: 100\u00d73=300, 20\u00d73=60, 1\u00d73=3. 300+60=360+3=363. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3\u00d71093=3279. 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3\u00d79841=29523. 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Correct.\n\nAnd finally, step 10: 3\u00d729524=88572. As calculated before, correct.\n\nSo, I think I've carefully checked each step and each multiplication, and everything adds up correctly. Therefore, the final result of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards step by step.\n\n1.

It seems like each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the inside, I see each \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's the first layer.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3 times that result, so 3*(1 + 3).\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + that result, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So maybe I can define each layer as a step and compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me try to map this out. Let's denote each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So yes, 9 layers.\n\nSo, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nSo, that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\n1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\n1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\n1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\n1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\n1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\n1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 is let's see, 9841*3.

Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that all checks out. I think I did each step correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. Let me try to parse this. It seems like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, counting the parentheses, let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each level adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to represent this as a series of expressions:\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\n- Level 1: (1 + 3)\n- Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1)\n- Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2)\n- Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3)\n- And so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking at the original expression, it's:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each next level is 3*(1 + previous_level). So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me number them from the inside out, so Level 1 is the innermost, and Level 9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to number them starting from the innermost as Level 1 and moving outward. So, let me see:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this Level 1.\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Let's call this Level 2.\n\nNext level out: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Level 3.\n\nContinuing: Level 4 would be 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because the original expression starts with 3*(...), so each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, starting from Level 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Level 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Level 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, but when I got to Level 9, I had 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I should write each step more carefully.\n\nLet me list each level:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so Level 9 is the outermost, which would be the entire expression. So, the result would be 36084.\n\nBut let me check if I did all the multiplications correctly.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each time, I'm taking the previous level, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and moving outward. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the levels correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each level adds one more layer. So, Level 1 is the innermost, and Level 9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, up to the 9th level.\n\nWait, actually, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, yes, 9 levels, each time going outward.\n\nWait, but when I computed Level 9 as 36,084, is that correct?\n\nLet me verify each step again, just to make sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 36,084.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression starts with 3*(...), so Level 1 is (1 + 3), which is 4, then Level 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on, up to Level 9, which is 3*(1 + Level 8). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, but since it's only 9 levels, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each level is following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15,\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48,\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147,\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444,\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335,\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008,\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027,\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the 9th term is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 3 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2.\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = 11/(2*3) = 11/6.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nLet's compute 10*6561 = 65,610,\n\nPlus 1*6561 = 6,561,\n\nTotal: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171.\n\nSubtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3.\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n3. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n4. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\).\n5. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\).\n6. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\).\n7. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\).\n8. Next level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\).\n9. Outermost level: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\).\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

Let me see if I can tackle this systematically.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression where each level is 1 plus 3 times something.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this structure.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Each layer seems to contain another similar expression inside. So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the result of the previous one. Let me write this out more clearly.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer to keep track of where I am. I'll number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9 since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple. Now, moving to Layer 2:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 = 360, and 1*3=3, so total is 363.\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12.

So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3*(29524) = ?\n\nCalculating that: 30000*3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mess up with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did each step accurately. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus three times the previous layer's result. Starting with Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is computed until Layer 9, which is 29,524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to parse this expression.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let's call that Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1+3(Layer 1)). That's Layer 2.\n3. The next one is (1+3(Layer 2)), which is Layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers in total because each \"1+3\" is nested inside another. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. Therefore, I need to compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Layer 1:**\nCompute (1 + 3).\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer1).\nLayer1 is 4, so it's 1 + 3*4.\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer2).\nLayer2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13.\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer3).\nLayer3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40.\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer4).\nLayer4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121.\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer5).\nLayer5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364.\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer6).\nLayer6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093.\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer7).\nLayer7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280.\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:**\nCompute (1 + 3 * Layer8).\nLayer8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841.\n3*9841 is let's calculate that: 9841*3.\n\nWait, let me compute that carefully:\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, Layer9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing Layer9, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n- The leading 2*3 is 6, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify my calculations because this seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLet me go back through each layer and verify.\n\n**Layer 1:**\n1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n**Layer 2:**\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n**Layer 3:**\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n**Layer 4:**\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n**Layer 5:**\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n**Layer 6:**\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n**Layer 7:**\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n**Layer 8:**\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n**Layer 9:**\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it easier without computing each layer manually. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is linear, so perhaps it can be expressed as L(n) = a*r^n + b.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo,\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D\n\n= 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nWhen n = 1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\n(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\n(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\n(3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\n(3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\n(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works. So, for Layer9, which is n=9, L(9)=29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, maybe I can compute it directly without going through each layer.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(L(9)), where L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2.\n\n59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost layer and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer recursively, starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. **Layer 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward because each part is dependent on the one inside it. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost expression and work my way out.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I notice that each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3(1 + ...), that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, then\n2. 3(1 + 3), then\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, so that suggests there are nine layers? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me write the structure more clearly:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3) = 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 3(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as each time you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, each step builds upon the previous one.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 3 * (1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original expression, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let me check:\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by computing the innermost expression first and then substitute it into the next layer.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(that result). Wait, no, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nLet me write it out step by step, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in that case, the innermost would be 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), then the next layer is 3*(1 + that result), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from Layer1 = 4, then Layer2 = 15, and so on up to Layer9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so maybe the outermost layer is Layer9, which would be the result. So, the final answer would be 36084.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the computations.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is computed correctly, and each step builds on the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, perhaps using geometric series or recursion, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step manually is feasible and reduces the chance of error.\n\nWait, another thought: this expression is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 3. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet me denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n).\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, yes, this confirms that the ninth term is 36084, which is the result of the original expression.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na_{n+1} = 3 + 3a_n\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nBecause (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since the original problem has nine layers, that corresponds to n=9.\n\nSo, a9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561\n\nThus,\n\na9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nFirst, 10*6561 = 65,610\n\nAdd 6561: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171\n\nSo, 11*6561 = 72,171\n\nSubtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168\n\nDivide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result of 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me check n=9 again.\n\na9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72,171 - 3)/2 = 72,168/2 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, both the iterative computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which can be expanded as 3 + 3*previous layer.\n\nBut I think the closed-form approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer adds another 3*3^n term, but I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 36,084.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. **Layer 3**: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. **Layer 4**: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. **Layer 5**: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. **Layer 6**: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. **Layer 7**: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. **Layer 8**: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. **Layer 9**: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. I'll number each set of parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for easier reference. Let me count them: there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with \"1+\" and then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking again, it's 1+3(...), so each level is 1 plus 3 times something.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Let's define each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, which is the innermost one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost is Level 9, so we need to compute from Level 9 outward.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each level adds another 3(...). Let me try to write it down as levels.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 9)\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 8)\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 7)\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 6)\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 5)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 4)\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 3)\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time we have 1+3(...) until the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, computing each step.\n\nLet me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost level. So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we multiply it by 3.\n\nSo the total is 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the levels.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Level 1: 4.\n\nThen Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524*3 again to make sure.\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me think again: is there a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each level manually?\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nEach level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can compute a_9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where B is a constant.\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume it's a constant B. Then:\n\nB = 3*B +1\n\n=> B -3B =1\n\n=> -2B=1\n\n=> B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2\n\nUsing initial condition a_1=4.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2\n\n=> 3A =4 +1/2=9/2\n\n=> A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches the manual computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, using the formula, I can confirm that a_9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each level is 1 + 3*previous level, so starting from 4, each level is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step approach and the formula both lead to the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous level). After computing each level up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent level by substituting the previous result into the next expression:\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set starts with 1 + 3 times something. Let me count them to make sure. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3 times the previous expression.\n\nSo, there are nine layers of this. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me label each layer from inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nSo, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nSo, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit big. Let me check that again. 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, that's correct.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nSo, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nHmm, that's getting big quickly. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here.\n\nWait a second, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... That seems like each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 * 3 + 1 = 13? Wait, 4 * 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yes, that's right.\n\nFrom Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13 * 3 + 1 = 40? 13*3 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nFrom Layer 3 to Layer 4: 40 * 3 + 1 = 121? 40*3 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Right.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, each time, it's like a recursive formula: Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe I can compute each layer step by step without having to write them all out, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nSo, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nSo, 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nSo, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7)  \nSo, 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nSo, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let me compute that step by step. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify my calculations because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step follows the pattern of 3*(previous layer) + 1, and each computation checks out when I go through it again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait a second, let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's model it mathematically.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1  \nSolving for L_p:  \nL_p - 3*L_p = 1  \n-2*L_p = 1  \nL_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n = 9:\n\nL(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't spot the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, and it still works. It's just that using the formula saves time, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods are feasible. I think the step-by-step computation is more intuitive for someone just starting out, while the formula is more efficient once you recognize the pattern.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 once again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying my results, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me try to figure this out. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. I'll number each set of parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as P1, P2, up to P9. That might help me keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost part, which is P1:\n\nP1: 1+3\n\nOkay, that's simple. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have P2:\n\nP2: 1 + 3*(result from P1)\n\nSo, substituting P1's result:\n\nP2: 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext, moving out another level, we have P3:\n\nP3: 1 + 3*(result from P2)\n\nSubstituting P2's result:\n\nP3: 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, P4:\n\nP4: 1 + 3*(result from P3)\n\nSubstituting:\n\nP4: 1 + 3*40\n\n3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNow, P5:\n\nP5: 1 + 3*(result from P4)\n\nWhich is:\n\nP5: 1 + 3*121\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nMoving on to P6:\n\nP6: 1 + 3*(result from P5)\n\nSo,\n\nP6: 1 + 3*364\n\n3 times 364 is... let me calculate that. 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nNext, P7:\n\nP7: 1 + 3*(result from P6)\n\nSo,\n\nP7: 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3 times 1093. Let's see, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 93 times 3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nProceeding to P8:\n\nP8: 1 + 3*(result from P7)\n\nWhich is:\n\nP8: 1 + 3*3280\n\n3 times 3280. Hmm, 3000 times 3 is 9000, 280 times 3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nFinally, P9:\n\nP9: 1 + 3*(result from P8)\n\nSo,\n\nP9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3 times 9841. Let me break it down: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by the result from P9. So, the expression simplifies to:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524. Breaking it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because 3 times 29524 seems like it might be a bit off. Alternatively, I can compute it directly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's do it digit by digit.\n\n4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 times 3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8.\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it the first time, I thought 3 times 29524 is 88572, and that seems consistent.\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nNow, adding them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but when I was computing P9, I thought it was 29524, which is correct because 1 + 3*9841 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous calculations because it's easy to get lost in the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nP1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nP2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nP3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nP4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nP5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nP6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nP7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nP8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nP9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's like a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYep, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe also need another condition. Let's compute a_2:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nUsing the formula, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nThen, plugging back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous result.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572\n\nYep, that's another way to look at it and confirms the result.\n\nSo, after all these steps and double-checking, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).

So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break this down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nIf I consider the layers as a sequence starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's compute a few terms to find another equation.\n\nFrom a_2 = 13, using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, this confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of this as a geometric series, but the nesting makes it a bit tricky because each term depends on the previous one. The recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nWait, another way: Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above.\n\nBut yeah, I think the step-by-step computation and the closed-form both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nI guess that's the solution. It took a while to compute each layer, but breaking it down step by step helped. Also, recognizing the pattern and finding the closed-form was a good check to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Wait, no, let me check. Actually, each level is 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right? Let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next inner expression). So starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, maybe I should parse it more carefully. Let me count the number of parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + ...). Then inside that, it's 3*(1 + ...), and so on. Let me see, each \"1+\" is followed by another 3*(...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI think there are nine sets of parentheses, so nine layers? Let me count the opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nYes, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9: 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the outermost is 3*(L9). So each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, except the outermost which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo let me write this out step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The outermost expression is 3*(L9). So after computing L9 as 29524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo total result = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524\n\n*       3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that's a lot of layers, and I might have made a mistake in computing L9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So L9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So L9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute it step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent every time. So I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous result. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Using a recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting lost in the complexity.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part seems to be \"1 + 3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, so 3*4 is 12, right? So then 1 + 12 is 13. Let me note that:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, moving up another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that would be:\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, now the next level up is another 1 + 3 times this new result. So:\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level is 1 + 3*121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, so adding 1 gives 364. Got it.\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nNext level up, it's 1 + 3*364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nMoving up another level, we have 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nNext level up is 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nContinuing to the next level, we have 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost level is 3 times this result.\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524\n\nLet me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- The next digits are 0s, so nothing to add.\n\nWait, that gives 88572. Hmm, but let me verify:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps, because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a small error that compounds.\n\nLet me go through each level again quickly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Let me check one or two steps again to be thorough.\n\nFor example, level 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nLevel 10: 3*29524 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've done this correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern.\n\nWait a second, this expression is a series of nested 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each step manually.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_i, where i is the level. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_n can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method also leads me to the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time. Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nSo, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nExpanding it, it's like 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, let me check. If I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), then expanding it would give 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1, but that might not be the case because each term is nested.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of a geometric series. From the recurrence solution, we saw that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each level, checking my calculations, and even using a different method involving recurrence relations, I arrive at the same result each time. Therefore, I can be certain that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

It's a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by something in parentheses. Each time, inside the parentheses, there's a 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... and so on, until the innermost part is 1 + 3). So, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from layer 1).\n3. Continuing this way, each time I add another layer until I reach the outermost one.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Continuing this, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n9. The outermost layer is 3(1+3(...)) which would be the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers inside is 8? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs:\n\n1. The innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3, each nested inside the next. Wait, no, let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each ... is another similar expression. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me write it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote L1, L2, L3, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen,\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L8 or L9, depending on how many layers there are.\n\nWait, let me count how many times 1 + 3 is present. Let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*L1.\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check how many layers I'm computing here. Each time I compute L1 to L9, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the outermost layer is L9, and then the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, until the outermost is L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to L9 = 29524, and then the entire expression would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I compute L1 to L9, each L is 1 + 3*previous L, so the outermost is L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each ... is another similar expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7.

(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2).\n\nAnd so on until layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to L9 = 29524, and then the entire expression would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check that step by step.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIf I define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, when I count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs, starting from the innermost, each time it's a new layer. So, in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time moving out, another (1 + 3*(...)), so how many times does 1 + 3 occur?\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3) in the expression:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, L1 to L9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2A\n\n=> A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that. 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nIn the original expression, how many times does the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each ... is another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 1, then each ( is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1.

( after 1 + 3\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers, but that can't be right because when I computed up to L9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time we have another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, how many times does (1 + 3) appear?

(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost is L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I computed up to L9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, not 9.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each ... is another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3) expressions is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3) expressions:\n\n1. The innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is L9, and the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nThus, with L9 =29524, the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL2 =1 +3*4=13\n\nL3=1 +3*13=40\n\nL4=1 +3*40=121\n\nL5=1 +3*121=364\n\nL6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nL7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since it's a recurrence, the closed-form is as I found earlier: L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Let me see if I can tackle this by working from the innermost part outwards. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and work your way outwards. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I'll try to identify the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, it seems like the innermost part is \"1+3\". Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nStarting from the left:\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Each time, there's another 1+3 inside.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check that:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another (1+3(...\n3. And so on, until the ninth one.\n\nWait, no, actually, each time it's 3(1+3(...)), so each level adds another 3*(1+3*(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times \"1+3\" appears before a closing parenthesis. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly, perhaps with indices to keep track:\n\nLevel 1: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \nLevel 2: The innermost part is 1+3, then each level wraps around that.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each parenthesis level. Let me try to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(...)) -> The innermost is the last (1+3), then each layer before that adds another 3*(1+...)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and working outwards. So, let me start by computing the innermost \"1+3\" and then substitute that value into the next level, and so on.\n\nSo, let's define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 3(1+3(...))\nLevel 2: The innermost is Level 9: 1+3\nLevel 8: 1+3(Level 9)\nLevel 7: 1+3(Level 8)\n...\nUp to Level 1.\n\nWait, maybe numbering from the inside out would be better. Let me think of it as layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) nine times, so perhaps each layer adds another 3*(1+...).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...)) terms.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me count how many times \"1+\" occurs before a closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is a repeated application of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression starts with 3(, then inside is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the ninth 1+3, then it closes with )))))))).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by evaluating the innermost first.\n\nSo, let me start by evaluating the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, each time, we're replacing the innermost expression with its value, then computing the next layer.\n\nSo, step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check again. Because each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let's list each step:\n\n1. Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we have 29524. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the 9-layer expression.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 3*29524. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n- 24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n- 24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n2. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+3\" appear?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3\" before the closing parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3\" occurs as a separate term. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is \"1+3\", then each layer adds another \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, actually, perhaps there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\", each wrapped in another 3*(...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went through 9 layers and got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this manually.\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40=120.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1+3(1+3)), let's compute that:\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=13\n\nEntire expression: 3*13=39.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, that would be Layer 2:1+3*4=13, then 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with 9 layers, I get 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis, except the last one. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after each \"1+3\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3\" appears before a closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Up to 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, each time adding another 3*(previous result) +1.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, then my calculation of 29524 and then 88572 would be correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute it step by step again, just to make sure.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n2. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), and the innermost is 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left:\n\n- The first 3( is at the beginning.\n- Then, inside, we have 1+3(, which is another 3(.\n- So, each time, 3( occurs after 1+.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3*(...) is 9, which would mean 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers.\n\nThen, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, no, f(1) would be 1+3=4.\n\nThen, f(2)=1+3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to f(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for f(n). Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for f(n).\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say f_p.\n\nSo, f_p = 1 + 3*f_p => f_p - 3*f_p = 1 => -2*f_p=1 => f_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more that the number of layers is indeed 9.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is \"1+3\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the ninth 1+3(...)\n\nWait, actually, the expression starts with 3(, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the ninth 1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute it digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n(no more digits) so carryover 2.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (innermost):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, we get the result 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
