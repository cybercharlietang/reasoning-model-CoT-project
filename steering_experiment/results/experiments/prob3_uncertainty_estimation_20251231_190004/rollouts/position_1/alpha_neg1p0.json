    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can tackle this step by step. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses and move outward. That way, I can simplify each part one at a time without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is just \"1 + 3\". So, let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another set of parentheses where this result is used. Let's look at that next part. It's \"1 + 3(1 + 3)\". Wait, no, actually, let me check again. The next level out is \"1 + 3(1 + 3)\".\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, after the innermost \"1 + 3\", the next layer is \"1 + 3(1 + 3)\". Hmm, so let me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have:\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3(1 + 3). But since we've already computed the innermost part, which is 1 + 3 = 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another parentheses where this result is used. Let me check: the next layer is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\". But since we've already computed the inner part as 13, this becomes 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, now, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\". Since the inner part is now 40, this becomes 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 121.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\", which is now 1 + 3*121.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*121 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext layer out: \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\", which becomes 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*364 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\", which is now 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*1093 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 3280.\n\nNext layer out: \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\", which becomes 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*3280 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer: \"1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\", which is now 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, this layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is the original expression: 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers and multiple steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested multiplications and additions. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(a9). Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses, which is a9.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each step is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, so in my earlier calculation, I computed a9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut in the sequence I just wrote, a10 would be 1 + 3*a9, but in our case, the outermost operation is just 3*a9, not 1 + 3*a9.\n\nSo, that's why the final result is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value after n layers.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers of nesting, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the formula derived from the recurrence\u2014we arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think this thorough step-by-step approach, combined with verifying using different methods, ensures that the answer is correct. It's always good to cross-check, especially when dealing with complex nested expressions where a single mistake can throw off the entire result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Finally, multiply this result by 3:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how you handle nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by writing down the innermost part and work my way out. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1+3) is 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next level out is 13. Now, moving another level out, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes (1 + 3*13).\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that.\n\n3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, the next level out is 121. Now, moving another level out, it's (1 + 3*121).\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. So now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*364).\n\n3*364 is... let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, the next level is 1093.\n\nMoving out another level, we have (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, now we're at 3280.\n\nGoing another level out, we have (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, the next level is 9841.\n\nMoving out another level, we have (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, now we're at 29524.\n\nAnother level out, we have (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... wait, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572, so 27000 + 1572 is 28572. So, 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again because 3*29524 is 88572, right? Because 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify that multiplication again because 88573 * 3. Let me compute 88,573 * 3. 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, carryover 2. 3*5 is 15 + 2 is 17, carryover 1. 3*8 is 24 + 1 is 25, carryover 2. 3*8 is 24 + 2 is 26. So, writing that out: 265,719. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 265,719 is 265,720.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*265720). Let's compute 3*265720. 3*200,000 is 600,000, 3*60,000 is 180,000, 3*5,000 is 15,000, 3*700 is 2,100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. So, 3*265,720 is 797,160. Then, 1 + 797,160 is 797,161.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again because 265,720 * 3: 200,000*3=600,000, 60,000*3=180,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 700*3=2,100, 20*3=60. So, 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. So, 1 + 797,160 is indeed 797,161.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*797,161). Let me compute 3*797,161. Let me break it down: 700,000*3=2,100,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 7,000*3=21,000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. So, 3*797,161 is 2,391,483. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 is 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way. 797,161 * 3: 1*3=3, 6*3=18, carryover 1. 1*3=3 + 1=4. 7*3=21, carryover 2. 9*3=27 + 2=29, carryover 2. 7*3=21

It looks like each step involves multiplying 3 by something that starts with 1 plus 3 times another expression. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with 1 + 3 times something. Let me count them to make sure. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's eight layers because the first one is just (1 + 3). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. Repeat this process until all layers are unwrapped.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4)\n3. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this until all layers are processed.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis after a 3 is a new layer. So, let's count:\n\n- After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), and then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. The expression ends with )))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: )))))))) is eight closing parentheses. So that would mean there are eight layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to compute eight layers, each time starting from the innermost and working outwards.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting after the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...), so each of those is a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...), which is the first layer.\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...), that's the second layer.\n- Continuing, each time we go deeper, adding another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer, but perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me try to write down each step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nThen, L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Now, the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which would be L9. So, the total expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted correctly. I think I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (this is the innermost, let's call this L1)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (L2)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (L3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (L4)\n5. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (L5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (L6)\n7. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (L7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (L8)\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (L9)\n\nWait, so L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n88,572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). Let's compute that:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount how many layers you've processed.\n\nLet me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 2 layers\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 3 layers\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer, which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so perhaps there are nine layers in total, not eight. That would mean my earlier calculation was incorrect because I stopped at L9 being 29,524, but perhaps I should have gone one more layer.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nIn the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...). Let's see how many times that happens.\n\n- After the first 3: (1 + 3(...\n- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...\n2. Inside that: (1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the last one, which is (1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nEach layer adds one more \"1 + 3(\", so starting from the first, each subsequent layer adds another.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, alternatively, let me count the number of times I see a \"3(\" followed by a \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The original expression ends with )))))))).\n\nThat's eight closing parentheses, which suggests there are eight layers. So, perhaps I was correct earlier with eight layers, but when I counted the layers, I went up to L9, which would be nine layers. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so that's one.\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...), that's two.\n- Continuing, each time, another 3(1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, but in the innermost part, it's (1 + 3), without another 3(1 + 3(...). So, perhaps the number of \"3(\" instances is eight.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...), except for the innermost, which is just (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of \"3(\" instances is eight, meaning there are eight layers of nesting.\n\nSo, perhaps I should have only eight layers, not nine.\n\nWait, let me try that again. If there are eight \"3(\" instances, then the number of layers is eight.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, let me recount with eight layers.\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with )))))))), which is eight closing parentheses. That suggests that there are eight layers of nesting, so eight \"3(\" instances.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should compute only eight layers, not nine.\n\nWait, let me try that again.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nWait, so after eight layers, the result is 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L8) = 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that: 9841 * 3.\n\nCompute:\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them up:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier result. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the outermost layer is included in the count or not.\n\nWait, in the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, which has eight layers inside.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf I have eight layers of (1 + 3(...)), then the outermost is L8, which is 9841, and then 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there were nine layers, leading to 88,572, but that might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recount how many layers there are.\n\nLet me write down the expression again, breaking it down:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is written as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would mean that the outermost layer is Layer9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the number of closing parentheses is eight, which suggests that the innermost is eight layers deep. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears, which is eight.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), except for the innermost, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of \"3*(...)\" is eight, meaning eight layers, with the innermost being (1 + 3).\n\nTherefore, the layers are:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I had nine layers leading to 88,572.\n\nI think the confusion is arising from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me clarify:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(something), where \"something\" is a nested expression with eight layers of (1 + 3*(...)). So, the \"something\" is computed as eight layers, leading to L8 = 9841, and then multiplied by 3, giving 29,523.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But perhaps I included an extra layer there.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 L1 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with )))))))) which is eight closing parentheses, suggesting that there are eight layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute eight layers, leading to L8 = 9841, and then multiply by 3 to get 29,523.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were nine layers, I went up to L9 = 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nI think the key is to correctly count the number of layers. Let me try a different approach: using a stack to parse the expression.\n\nLet me write the expression as a string and count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me remove the multiplication signs for clarity:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nNow, let's parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- The first character is '3', then '(', so we have 3*(...\n\nInside, it's 1 + 3(...), so that's the first layer.\n\nEach time we encounter a '3(', that's a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of '3(' in the expression.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '3(' is a new layer.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each containing 1 plus 3 times something. It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the result of the inner part.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nWait, looking at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and it's nested 8 times? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe it's 8 layers because each time it's 1 + 3(...), and there are 8 such instances before the final 3 multiplies it.\n\nWait, maybe I should just work step by step from the inside out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9, perhaps.

So, maybe it's 8 layers, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let's start:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13).

So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me check: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I may have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount how many layers I processed. Starting from the innermost, each step is one layer, so let me check:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Then, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so maybe I have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time, the number increases. Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(...) (Layer 2)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9, perhaps?\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds a new set of parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the first 3*(...) has 8 more layers inside. Let me check:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, then each time, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times do we do this?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) in the expression:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of layers would be 9, because each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each layer corresponds to one set of parentheses. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first set, and then each subsequent layer adds another set. So, how many sets are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost to the outermost, the number of sets is 9. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step, as I did before, to avoid confusion.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the final result is 3 times that.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so that would correspond to 3*(Layer 9 result). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recompute each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait a second, but I just noticed that in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed the final result.\n\nBut let me just verify the computation of 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, so 2 with carryover 7.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to compute as:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 29,524 * 3 in another way.\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 (Final Result)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3, which makes sense because each time you add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1 + 3*(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so how many times does that happen?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count the number of 1 + 3*(...) inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3*(...)\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and the first 3*(...) is the outermost. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, my step-by-step computation seems correct, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without doing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula for repeated multiplication.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nWait, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (a - 1)/ (1 - r) + (r^{n} - 1)/(1 - r), but perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSo, substituting L_n = A into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got by computing each layer step by step. So, that confirms that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, I can compute L_9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^{10} is 59,049. Then, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've solved it correctly. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that involve 1 plus 3 times another expression. It seems to be a repeating pattern, so maybe I can work from the inside out.\n\nLet me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward. That usually helps with these nested expressions.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. So the next layer is:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so now the next layer out would be:\n\n1 + 3*(13)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try again, maybe I should number each step to keep track.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many parentheses there are.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3.

Each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers because the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 3(...). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 8 instances of 3(...). So, that would mean 8 layers, right?\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3's after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside, then inside, each time we have 3*(...).

Wait, no, let me count.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe expression is: ...1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is inside 8 closing parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), which is followed by a closing parenthesis at the end of each layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost expression.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so that would be 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Since the innermost is L1 = 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start computing each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way to break it down.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (L1)\n2. 1 + 3*(L1) = 13 (L2)\n3. 1 + 3*(L2) = 40 (L3)\n4. 1 + 3*(L3) = 121 (L4)\n5. 1 + 3*(L4) = 364 (L5)\n6. 1 + 3*(L5) = 1093 (L6)\n7. 1 + 3*(L6) = 3280 (L7)\n8. 1 + 3*(L7) = 9841 (L8)\n9. 1 + 3*(L8) = 29524 (L9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer is correctly computed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me compute 3*(L9) again.\n\nL9 = 29524\n\n3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that's not the correct way to break it down.

Starting from the inside, I think each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by something. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see: starting from the innermost, there's one 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another. Let me count the parentheses: each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that, so 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nStarting from the innermost, let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Continuing: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers? Let me check. The innermost is 1+3, then each time we wrap another 1+3 around it, so starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So there are 9 layers of 1+3, each nested inside the next.\n\nWait, but the expression starts with 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(...), then inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, nine times. So, to compute this, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each step as I go.\n\nLet me write down each step, starting from the innermost expression.\n\nLet's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but when I count the number of layers, let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, starting from layer 1 as 1+3, then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), and so on, up to layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times 1+3 appears, let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 inside another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me see:\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because I'm not sure if I counted correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, so:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7.

Finally: 3*(1+3(...)) which would be 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, so my initial calculation is correct, 9 layers, so Layer9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nI can see that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is 1 + 3*a_n-1.\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify with another approach to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the expansion would be similar to a geometric progression.\n\nLet me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4\n\nWait, that's getting a bit messy. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression by expanding each term step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can compute each layer again to ensure that I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 11.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to tackle this. It seems like each layer is a similar expression, so maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). So that's the first step. Let me compute that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that. Each time I replace the innermost parentheses, I should move outward one step. So the innermost was the last (1+3), which becomes 4. Now, the next layer out is the one before that, which is (1 + 3*result). So let me write that down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step as I go, replacing each innermost parentheses with its value. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nSo the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nNow, the next innermost parentheses is the one before that, which is (1 + 3(1 + 4)). Wait, no, actually, each time I compute the innermost, I should move one step up. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number each layer from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = (1 + 3*4)\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nSo perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 9 and moving outward to Layer 1.\n\nLet me list each layer from 9 to 1:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 7))\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 6))\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 5))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 4))\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 3))\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing, but let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nSo Layer 8: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo Layer 1: 29523\n\nWait, so the final result is 29523? Let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Each step checks out, so the final answer should be 29523.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out.\n\nSo a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9 being 4, then Layer 8 as 13, and so on. But actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9 where a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps it with (1 + 3*(...)), and finally, the outermost is 3*(...). So the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\na_2 = (1 + 3*a_1) = 13\n\na_3 = (1 + 3*a_2) = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier computation. Wait, in my earlier computation, the outermost layer was 3*a_8, where a_8 was 9841, giving 29523. But here, a_9 is 29524, which would be the innermost, but that doesn't align with the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indexing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*a_n), so:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost layer is 3*a_8, because the expression is 3*(a_9). But a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572, which contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake in the earlier computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n3. (1 + 3(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n4. (1 + 3(layer3)) \u2192 layer4\n5. (1 + 3(layer4)) \u2192 layer5\n6. (1 + 3(layer5)) \u2192 layer6\n7. (1 + 3(layer6)) \u2192 layer7\n8. (1 + 3(layer7)) \u2192 layer8\n9. (1 + 3(layer8)) \u2192 layer9\n10. The outermost is 3*(layer9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), and the outermost is 3*(layer9). So layer9 is (1 + 3*(layer8)).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step correctly.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 88572, which is different from my earlier result of 29523. Clearly, I made a mistake in my initial computation. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nAh, I see. In my first approach, I considered the outermost layer as 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841 = 29523, but actually, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So my initial computation was incorrect because I stopped one layer too early.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...)) is a layer, and there are 9 such layers, with the outermost being 3*(layer9). So I need to compute up to layer9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me redo the layers correctly:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final answer was 29523. That was my mistake. I think I miscounted the layers and stopped at layer8 instead of layer9. So let me correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct step-by-step computation is as above, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again to be sure.\n\nCompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. It resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. The general form is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating (1 + 3 * previous result), and this is done 9 times, with the final result multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Move outward, computing each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like each part is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1, but it's done repeatedly. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression for clarity, maybe numbering each step. So, starting from the innermost part:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count them. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So let's start from the inside.\n\nLet me define each step:\n\nLet me start by evaluating the innermost part, which is the 1+3. Then, each subsequent layer will use that result.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost part is the last one: 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them from the inside out. Let's see:\n\nLet me number the layers from 1 to 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but that seems like it's growing quickly. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost part first.\n\nInnermost Layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Layer 9 result.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nWait, so actually, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me confirm the layers again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 occur?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(previous)\n3. So, let's see, how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a 1+3, and there are 9 of them before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet me compute from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost 1+3.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step 9). So, we compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me list out each step again:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3, right? Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each time moving out, we have another 1+3(...). So, let's count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), so each time we have a new opening parenthesis, it's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another ( after 1+3: (1+3(\n3. And so on, until the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because each 1+3 is followed by another (.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times (1+3 occurs:\n\n- The first 1+3 is at the innermost, then each time moving out, another (1+3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to a step from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, my initial computation was correct, with 9 steps, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses after the first 3, that would mean 9 layers of 1+3, each nested inside the previous one. So, yes, the general solution applies here.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since it's a nested multiplication, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general solution, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try to tackle it from the inside out, as I remember that's how you handle such expressions. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outward. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, if I can compute the innermost part first, then substitute that result into the next layer, and so on, I can probably solve this without getting lost.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3, added to 1, and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3*(...). It looks like it's 1+3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine 3s. Hmm, maybe eight layers? Let me see.\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 times another expression, so each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(...)) and each inner part has another 3(...). So, how many times does 3(1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times \"3(\" appears: Let's see, starting from the first 3(, then each time inside another 3(. So, from the outermost, the first 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on until the innermost, which is 1+3. So, how many 3( are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so there are nine 3(, but the innermost is just 1+3, so maybe there are eight layers? Let me think. Each 3( adds a new layer, so starting from the outermost, which is 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent layer is another 3(1+3(...)). So, if I have nine 3(, that would imply nine layers, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), so each time you go in, you add another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the outermost, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth layer. So, perhaps there are nine layers? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). Wait, so perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1: 1+3=4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4=13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2=1+3*13=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, so the total would be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from L1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3( appears. Starting from the first 3( after the initial 3, then each inner part adds another 3(. So, how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each inner part adds another 3(, so:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so that's nine 3(, but the innermost is just 1+3, so perhaps there are nine layers. But in my earlier calculation, I only went up to L9 as 1+3*(L8)=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the number of layers again. Let me count the number of 3( after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, the first inner 3( is at position 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3(, which is 9, but the innermost is 1+3, so perhaps the number of layers is 9, but each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1=1+3=4, then L2=1+3*L1, up to L9=1+3*L8. Then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, yes, that would make sense. So, my calculation seems correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again to be sure.\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can see if there's a geometric series or some pattern here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, let's define n properly. Let's say n=1 corresponds to L1=4, n=2 corresponds to L2=13, etc.\n\nSo, for n=1, L1=4.\n\nPlugging into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using this pattern, each layer is computed sequentially, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation confirms that the result is 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the expression is built up like this: each time, you have 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3. It repeats multiple times. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3.\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1), then multiplied by 3.\n3. This seems to repeat a total of 8 times because I can see 8 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression: there are 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). Hmm, so maybe it's 8 layers deep? Wait, no, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(previous), and so on, until the outermost one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(innermost result).\n3. Each time, it's 1+3*(previous result), and this happens multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start by computing the innermost expression and then build up each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let me define a1 as the innermost expression, then a2 as the next layer, and so on until a9, which is the outermost expression.\n\nSo, a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2.\n\nAnd so on, until a9, which would be the entire expression, and then the total result is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the entire expression is 3*(a9). So, let me confirm:\n\nThe problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, a1 is the innermost 1 + 3, then each subsequent a is 1 + 3*a_previous, and finally, the total expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time, 1 + 3*(previous), and that happens 8 times, right? Because after the first 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of 1+3(...) layers. Each time you have a 1+3*(...), which is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me look:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, the total number of layers is 9, because each time you have a new 1+3(, and the last one is just 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see it as each layer is a step. Let me try to compute each step one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me define a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9, and then the total expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(a9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, let's compute each a step by step.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if I'm correctly counting the layers. Wait, when I computed a1 through a9, each a corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is a1, then a2, up to a9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so yes, the outermost is 3*a9, where a9 is the result of the innermost expression built up 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed a9 as 29524, then the total expression would be 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nLet me go through each a step by step:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000,\n\n9000*3=27000,\n\n500*3=1500,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n4*3=12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo, 2*10000=20000,\n\n9*1000=9000,\n\n5*100=500,\n\n2*10=20,\n\n4*1=4.\n\nSo, 20000 + 9000 = 29000,\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500,\n\n29500 + 20 = 29520,\n\n29520 + 4 = 29524.\n\nNow, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000,\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000,\n\n500 * 3 = 1500,\n\n20 * 3 = 60,\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560,\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because it's easy to miscalculate in arithmetic, especially with larger numbers.\n\nStarting from a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each step manually, but given that the number of layers is manageable (9 layers), computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe I can see a pattern in the a terms.\n\nLooking at the a terms:\n\na1 = 4,\n\na2 = 13,\n\na3 = 40,\n\na4 = 121,\n\na5 = 364,\n\na6 = 1093,\n\na7 = 3280,\n\na8 = 9841,\n\na9 = 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if they follow a particular sequence or if there's a formula that can express a_n in terms of n.\n\nLet me see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which confirms our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Then each subsequent part is 3 times (1 + something). So, starting from the inside:\n\nLet me number the parentheses for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3(Level 1))\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3(Level 2))\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, there are nine sets of (1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent level adds another 3*(previous level +1). Hmm, maybe it's better to compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2\n\nAnd so on, up to A9, since there are nine levels.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the original expression again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, perhaps I can compute each step one by one.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next level out is (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). So, 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next level is (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next level: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from Step 9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, actually, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it correctly.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit off. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1+3=4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each level involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each layer is another multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to parse this from the inside out. I think that's the way to go because each expression depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. Let's see, the innermost part is (1+3), right? Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that result plus 1. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the problem, each time it's 3*(...), so maybe each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. So each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer.\n\nSo perhaps I should compute starting from the innermost layer and work my way out. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay, that's correct.\n\nMoving on:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, so I think I have nine layers here, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nBut then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Because each time, the layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So when I compute Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, so that would be 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7.\n\n52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163, write down 3 and carry over 16.\n\n95 * 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301, write down 1 and carry over 30.\n\n29 * 3 = 87, plus 30 is 117, write down 7 and carry over 11.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6, plus 11 is 17.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88572, right? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem had 9 layers, but when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nLet me confirm the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each time it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer is a new set.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen 1+3*(Layer1) is Layer2.\n\nContinuing until Layer9, which is the outermost. So the total expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think. Each time, we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's another way to confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is correct. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous) +1.\n\nCounting the number of times 1+3 occurs: each (1+3) is one layer, and each time it's wrapped in another 3*(...) +1.\n\nWait, actually, in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest these expressions.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(Layer n-1).\n\nSo how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1, then inside that, another ( is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each time after the 3, there's a new layer. So starting from the first 3, there's Layer 1, then inside that, Layer 2, etc., up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed, I had Layer 1 as 1+3, then Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So that's correct.\n\nSo the number of layers is 9, leading to a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to write out the expression with the layers labeled.\n\nExpression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each time you go out a layer, you have another 1 + 3*(Layer n-1).\n\nSo each (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer.\n\nSo the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest these expressions, which is 9.\n\nHence, a_9 is 29524, and the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a sum, it might resemble a geometric series, but each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nBut I think I've verified it enough ways. The answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nLet me write this out more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term that includes a 1 and another nested expression. It seems like there are nine layers of parentheses here. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each layer adds another (1 + 3*...)\n3. Up to nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, there are nine sets of \"1 + 3(...)\", so maybe it's eight layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2013 that's the first one.\n\nThen, moving out, the next one is (1 + 3*(...)), where ... is the first one.\n\nSo, each time, we have a new layer. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested part as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(E9). So, perhaps E9 is the innermost, and each subsequent E is built upon the previous.\n\nWait, maybe I should index them the other way around. Let me try again.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3)\n\nStep 2: Use that result to compute the next outer expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\n\nStep 3: Use that result to compute the next outer expression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\n\nAnd so on, until I reach the outermost expression, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let me number these steps from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", so I think I need to perform nine steps, each time computing the value inside and substituting it into the next layer.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer, then each layer above is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I should define E1 as the innermost, E2 as the next one, up to E9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, that might be confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but hold on, each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me create a list of results, starting from the innermost:\n\nCompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after computing all nine layers, Layer9 is 29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer9.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, compute 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3 * 524 = 1572\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524 more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nWait, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3*(...)\", so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each \"1 + 3\".\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first.\n\nThen, the next one is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is the second.\n\nContinuing, each time adding another layer.\n\nSo, let me see: the expression is 3*(...), where ... is (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on, nine times.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\", starting from the innermost, it's 8 layers before we reach the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3*(...)\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 that's the innermost, no multiplication yet.\n\n2. Then, moving out, (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2013 that's the first multiplication.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWait, no, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous expression).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as having eight layers of multiplication by 3, because each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not correctly counting the layers.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me write down the expression with indices to make it clearer.\n\nLet me denote E1 as the innermost expression:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, E1 to E9 are:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLet me recompute each Ei:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute it using another method or check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each Ei follows a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Ei = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nEi = 1 + 3*E(i-1)\n\nWith E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when Ei = 3*E(i-1), which has the solution Ei^h = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ei^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> -2K = 1\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nEi = C*3^i - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nEi = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^(i+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nEi = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each i, Ei = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nE1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor i=4:\n\nE4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^(10) -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 multiplied by something, and then all of that is multiplied by 3 again. So it's like a chain of operations.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost bracket and compute each part one by one, it'll become clearer.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nSo each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(something)). So, starting from the innermost, let's define each step.\n\nLet me number the expressions from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Let's say:\n\nExpression 1: 1 + 3\n\nExpression 2: 1 + 3*(Expression 1)\n\nExpression 3: 1 + 3*(Expression 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Expression 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a multiplication by 3. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the right, each 1+3 is followed by another (1+3...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count how many times 3 is being multiplied.

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be easier. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I understand it correctly. It's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (... and so on, until the innermost part is 1+3). So, starting from the inside, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3*4 = 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next layer is 13. Moving out another step, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now, the next layer is 40. Going out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\n3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, so that's 121. Next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me do that.\n\n3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMoving out another step, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that.\n\n3*364: Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, so now we have 1093. Next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate that.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is indeed 3280. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nAlright, so that's 9841. The next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. So, adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 3*88573: 88573 * 3. Let's compute it:\n\n88573\n*      3\n--------\n3*3=9, 3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2. 3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2. 3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2. 3*0=0 +2=2. So, it's 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that.\n\n3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. So, adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*265720: 265720 * 3. Let's compute it:\n\n265720\n*      3\n--------\n0*3=0, 2*3=6, 7*3=21, 5*3=15, 6*3=18, 2*3=6. Wait, let me do it step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0.\n\n2*3=6.\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down: 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nAlright, so that's 797161. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that.\n\n3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. So, adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000, 2391000 + 300 = 2391300, 2391300 + 180 = 2391480, 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 3*797161: 797161 * 3.\n\n797161\n*      3\n--------\n1*3=3.\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carryover 2.\n\nThere's a 7 at the start: 7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carryover 2. But since there are no more digits, we write down 23.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3.\n\n6*3=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write 3, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the 3. So, it's 2391483.\n\nThen, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nAlright, that's correct. So, now we have 2391484. The next layer is 1 + 3*(2391484). Let me compute that.\n\n3*2000000 is 6000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*80 is 240, 3*4 is 12. Let me add them up:\n\n6000000 + 900000 = 6900000.\n\n6900000 + 270000 = 7170000.\n\n7170000 + 3000 = 7173000.\n\n7173000 + 1200 = 7174200.\n\n7174200 + 240 = 7174440.\n\n7174440 + 12 = 7174452.\n\nThen, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nWait, let me check that. 3*2391484: 2391484 * 3.\n\n2391484\n*      3\n--------\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, write 4, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write 1, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down: 7174452.

Let me compute that.\n\n3*7000000 is 21000000, 3*100000 is 300000, 3*70000 is 210000, 3*4000 is 12000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*50 is 150, 3*3 is 9. Let me add them up:\n\n21000000 + 300000 = 21300000.\n\n21300000 + 210000 = 21510000.\n\n21510000 + 12000 = 21522000.\n\n21522000 + 1200 = 21523200.\n\n21523200 + 150 = 21523350.\n\n21523350 + 9 = 21523359.\n\nThen, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 3*7174453: 7174453 * 3.\n\n7174453\n*      3\n--------\n3*3=9.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n\n7*3=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2.\n\n1*3=3 +2=5.\n\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2.\n\nThere's a 7 at the start: 7*3=21 +2=23, write 3, carryover 2. But since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the 3. So, it's 21523359.\n\nThen, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nAlright, that's correct. So, now we have 21523360. The next layer is 1 + 3*(21523360). Let me compute that.\n\n3*20000000 is 60000000, 3*1000000 is 3000000, 3*500000 is 1500000, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*600 is 1800, 3*60 is 180, 3*0 is 0. Let me add them up:\n\n60000000 + 3000000 = 63000000.\n\n63000000 + 1500000 = 64500000.\n\n64500000 + 60000 = 64560000.\n\n64560000 + 9000 = 64569000.\n\n64569000 + 1800 = 64570800.\n\n64570800 + 180 = 64570980.\n\n64570980 + 0 = 64570980.\n\nThen, 1 + 64570980 = 64570981.\n\nWait, let me check that. 3*21523360: 21523360 * 3.\n\n21523360\n*      3\n--------\n0*3=0.\n\n6*3=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carryover 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\n2*3=6.\n\nSo, writing it out: 64570080.

It seems like each step involves multiplying 3 by a sum that includes another similar expression. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each level as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count. Starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then moving out, it's (1+3(...))\n3. Repeating until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, let's count the number of closing parentheses. Each \"1+3\" is a separate term, so maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, computing each layer from the inside out.\n\nLet me write each step:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2\n\n...\n\nUp to S9: 1 + 3*S8\n\nThen the total expression is 3*S9.\n\nSo let's compute each S step by step.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow S2:\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*S9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen total: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 step by step to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + any carryover?

Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming S_n^p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition S1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nS1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: S2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, S9 is when n=9:\n\nS9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo S9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen the total expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression. Calculating each layer step by step or using the formula for the sum of a geometric series both confirm the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses is itself another expression. So, to solve this, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because in order to compute the value of the outer expressions, I need to know the value of the inner ones first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next part is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nSo, now, replacing the innermost part with this result, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost part was (1 + 3) which is 4, then multiplied by 3 gives 12. So, the next layer is (1 + 12), correct? So, yes, that becomes 13.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer is 3*(4) which is 12, and then that's inside another (1 + ...). So, it's 1 + 12, which is 13.\n\nSo, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression now is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 13)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that again. The next layer is (1 + 3*(...)), where the ... was (1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, that ... becomes 4, then 3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13. So, yes, correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 13 = 39\n\nSo, now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 39)))))))))\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where ... was (1 + 3*(...)), which we just computed as 13. So, 3*13=39, then 1 + 39=40.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me take it step by step because I'm getting confused.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n11. Next layer: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279\n13. Next layer: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840\n15. Next layer: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count the number of layers to make sure I'm not missing any steps. The original expression has multiple layers. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, that means starting from the innermost, I have to compute 9 layers. Let me list them step by step.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nS2: 3*S1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nS3: (1 + S2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS4: 3*S3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nS5: (1 + S4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS6: 3*S5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nS7: (1 + S6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS8: 3*S7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nS9: (1 + S8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after S9, we have another 3*... So, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers because the outermost is 3*(...). So, let me try to outline the structure more clearly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen moving out:\n\n2. 3*4 = 12\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. 3*13 = 39\n\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n\n6. 3*40 = 120\n\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n\n8. 3*121 = 363\n\n9.

(1 + 9840) = 9841\n\n16. 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that seems like 16 steps, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to structure it more clearly.\n\nEach time, we have a layer of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me list the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer 11: (1 + Layer 10) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 12: 3*(Layer 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer 13: (1 + Layer 12) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 14: 3*(Layer 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer 15: (1 + Layer 14) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 16: 3*(Layer 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? Because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, I ended up with 16 layers, which can't be right because the expression only has 9 layers. So, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me try to count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, 9 times.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n\n12. 3*(1093) = 3279\n\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280\n\n14. 3*(3280) = 9840\n\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841\n\n16. 3*(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, but that's 16 steps, but the original expression only has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to structure it differently.\n\nLet me think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a step, and each step is multiplied by 3 in the next layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(Step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nStep 3: (1 + Step 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 4: 3*(Step 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nStep 5: (1 + Step 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 6: 3*(Step 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nStep 7: (1 + Step 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 8: 3*(Step 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nStep 9: (1 + Step 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 10: 3*(Step 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nStep 11: (1 + Step 10) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 12: 3*(Step 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nStep 13: (1 + Step 12) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 14: 3*(Step 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nStep 15: (1 + Step 14) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 16: 3*(Step 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so I must have miscounted. Let me try to count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first (1 + 3) is the innermost.\n\n- Then, each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each nested within the previous one.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\n3. Layer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\n5. Layer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\n7. Layer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\n9. Layer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNow, after Layer 9, we have another 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be:\n\n10. Layer 10: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(...), so that would be Layer 10 multiplied by 3 again? Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), so after Layer 9, which is 364, we have 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost up to Layer 9, which is 364, the outermost is 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, that seems too low because when I computed earlier, I got up to 29523, which was after 16 layers. But according to the structure, there are only 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so the outermost is 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n\n10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nSo, after 10 layers, the result is 1092.\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so the outermost is 3*(result after 9 layers).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) in the original expression.\n\nEach time, after the first 3, it's (1 + 3*(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3(...)) is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down the layers again, numbering them from inside out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092\n\nSo, after 10 layers, the result is 1092.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which after 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) would be Layer 9: 364, then multiplied by 3 gives 1092.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 16 layers, I got 29523, which seems too big, but perhaps that was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me confirm with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help here.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form (1 + 3*previous). So, starting from 4, each step is (1 + 3*previous).\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, starting from the innermost:\n\na1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's 9 terms, starting from a1 to a9. But in the original expression, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so the final result after 9 layers would be a9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 again?\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the 9-layer expression. So, if after 9 layers, the inner part is a9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I thought after 9 layers, it was 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. So, where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to write down the expression again, but with indices to clarify.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote E(n) as the expression with n layers.\n\nSo, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*121)) = 3*(1 + 3*364) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1093)) = 3*(1 + 3*3280) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*29523)) = 3*(1 + 3*88570) = 3*(1 + 265710) = 3*265711 = 797133\n\nWait, but this seems like it's growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nBut in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of (1 + 3(...) is 9. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, E(9) would be the expression with 9 layers, which according to the above would be:\n\nE(1) = 12\n\nE(2) = 39\n\nE(3) = 120\n\nE(4) = 363\n\nE(5) = 1092\n\nE(6) = 3279\n\nE(7) = 9840\n\nE(8) = 29521\n\nE(9) = 88564\n\nWait, but that's not matching my earlier calculations. I think I'm getting confused because each E(n) is 3*(1 + 3*E(n-1)).\n\nWait, let's define E(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So:\n\nE(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 3*(1 + 3*121) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 3*(1 + 3*364) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 3*(1 + 3*1093) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 3*(1 + 3*3280) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) = 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, E(9) is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought I had 9 layers, I ended up with 1092, but that was E(5). So, I think the confusion was in how I was counting the layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from E(1) up to E(9), which gives the final result as 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach, perhaps using a formula for such recursive expressions.\n\nThe general form is E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)).\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each layer is E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), where E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nBut wait, let's define E(n) as the value after n layers. So:\n\nE(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + E(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + E(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + E(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + E(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + E(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation. So, E(9) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me check this again because when I first thought I had 9 layers, I was getting 1092, which was E(5). So, to avoid confusion, let me list all E(n) up to n=9:\n\nn | E(n)\n1 | 12\n2 | 39\n3 | 120\n4 | 363\n5 | 1092\n6 | 3279\n7 | 9840\n8 | 29523\n9 | 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe denote each layer as E(n), where n is the number of layers computed so far.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (n=1):**\n   E(1) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 3) = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\n2. **Next layer (n=2):**\n   E(2) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(1)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12) = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n\n3. **Next layer (n=3):**\n   E(3) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(2)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 39) = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n\n4. **Next layer (n=4):**\n   E(4) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(3)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 120) = 3 \u00d7 121 = 363\n\n5. **Next layer (n=5):**\n   E(5) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(4)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 363) = 3 \u00d7 364 = 1092\n\n6. **Next layer (n=6):**\n   E(6) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(5)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1092) = 3 \u00d7 1093 = 3279\n\n7. **Next layer (n=7):**\n   E(7) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(6)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 3279) = 3 \u00d7 3280 = 9840\n\n8. **Next layer (n=8):**\n   E(8) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(7)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 9840) = 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29523\n\n9. **Final layer (n=9):**\n   E(9) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + E(8)) = 3 \u00d7 (1 + 29523) = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you always solve the innermost one first and then move outward. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer is of the form 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1: 1 + 3*(result)\n3. This repeats several times.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times the 3(1+...) pattern occurs. Let me look again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let's see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, let's count the number of 3(1+... parts.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer adds another 3(1+... So starting from the innermost, each time we have one more layer. Let me count:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is the second layer.\n- Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), third layer.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a 3 followed by a (, that's a new layer. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times '1+3(' appears. Let me try that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer after the initial 3( is another 1+3(, so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers? Wait, maybe 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of '1+3(' segments.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on. So, how many times does 3(1+3 occur?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The original expression ends with 9 closing parentheses, so that suggests that there are 9 layers? Wait, no, because each 3(1+3(...) would have one opening and one closing parenthesis. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each layer as I go. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost part:\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, step 2 result is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, step 3 result is 40.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 4 result: 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 5 result: 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 6 result: 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 7 result: 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 8 result: 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 9 result: 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 = 7.\n\n5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's correct because 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 =4 (step1)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (step2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (step3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (step4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (step5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (step6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (step7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (step8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (step9)\n10. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, total steps are 10? Wait, but in my initial count, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I went through the steps, I had 9 steps inside and then one more step for the outer 3. So, maybe the expression has 9 layers inside, each adding a 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, total 10 layers, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, each time adding a 1+3*(...). So, when I started computing, I had 9 steps inside, each step going one layer out, and then the final step is multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a 3 followed by a (, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of times 3( appears after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the initial expression is 3(1+3(...)), so that's the first 3(. Then inside, it's 1+3(...), which is another 3(, and so on. Let me count how many 3( there are in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each inner 3( adds a layer. Let me count the number of 3( in the expression.\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that can't be right because the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me try to see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, how many times do we have 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we have a 1+3(, so the number of such segments is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers inside, each adding a 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I did the steps, I had 9 steps inside, each time computing the next layer out, and then the final step was multiplying by 3. So, that would be 10 steps in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4 (step1)\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=13 (step2)\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40 (step3)\n4. Next:1+3*40=121 (step4)\n5. Next:1+3*121=364 (step5)\n6. Next:1+3*364=1093 (step6)\n7. Next:1+3*1093=3280 (step7)\n8. Next:1+3*3280=9841 (step8)\n9. Next:1+3*9841=29524 (step9)\n10. Finally, 3*29524=88572 (step10)\n\nSo, that's 10 steps. So, the expression has 9 layers inside, each with 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with such large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Step1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Step2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Step3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Step4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Step5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Step6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Step7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Step8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Step9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Step10: 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute this without having to do each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, with characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 1\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Starting from the innermost, which is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524.\n\nBecause we have 9 layers inside, each adding a 1+3*(...), so the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. This might be a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. However, using the formula gives us a quick way to find a_9 without computing each step.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous step)}\\). \n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times something.

And so on, until the ninth one.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each step one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me assign each step a number from 1 to 9 for clarity.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nStarting with the very inside: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute back into the next parentheses**\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n\nSo, substituting the result from step 1, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(4)\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, step 2 gives us 13.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute back into the next parentheses**\n\nNext, we have another level: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n\nSubstituting 13 from step 2:\n\n1 + 3*(13)\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, step 3 gives us 40.\n\n**Step 4: Continue substituting**\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n\nSubstituting 40:\n\n1 + 3*(40)\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, step 4 result is 121.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute again**\n\nNext expression: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n\nSubstituting 121:\n\n1 + 3*(121)\n\nCompute 3*121: 3*121 = 363\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 5 result is 364.\n\n**Step 6: Continue substituting**\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n\nSubstituting 364:\n\n1 + 3*(364)\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 364*3.

Let me do it directly:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\n29,523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 3*9841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 29,523.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a nested multiplication where each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). This resembles a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't match my previous result. Wait, no, in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so in my earlier step-by-step, the final result was 3*a_8, which is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut if I denote a_9 as 1 + 3*a_8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, but that's not part of the original problem. The original problem stops at a_8 and multiplies by 3.\n\nSo, the confusion arises because in my recursive definition, a_9 would be the next term, but in the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(a_8), so the final result is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nSo, that still holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 8 levels of parentheses (from a_1 to a_8), and then we multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a_8 = 3*(9841) =29,523.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841, so 3*a_8=3*(3^9 -1)/2= (3^{10} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^10=59049\n\nSo, (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, used a recursive approach, derived a closed-form formula, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 29,523 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. By systematically computing each level and substituting the result into the next level, we find that the final value is 29,523.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Start with the innermost parentheses:**\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Work outward, substituting each result into the next parentheses:**\n   - 1 + 3(4) = 13\n   - 1 + 3(13) = 40\n   - 1 + 3(40) = 121\n   - 1 + 3(121) = 364\n   - 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n   - 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n   - 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29,523\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, it seems like the innermost part is \"1+3\". So, let me write that down first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, I see that this result is multiplied by 3. So, the next step is to compute 3 times that result. Let me write that down.\n\nNext level: 3 * (1 + 3) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on, actually, looking back at the original problem, the structure is a bit more nested. Let me make sure I'm breaking it down correctly. Each level seems to be of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each time I compute the innermost expression first, then work my way out.\n\nSo, let me list each step systematically. Maybe writing each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me check: each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level, so counting from the innermost, there are nine levels. Hmm, actually, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nUp to Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the problem again, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a sum, which itself is 1 plus 3 times another sum, and so on, nine times. So, the innermost is indeed 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level), and finally, the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive structure, where each level is defined as 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time, we compute the next level by taking 1 + 3*(result from the previous level). Then, after computing all nine levels, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, but actually, when I look at the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and this happens eight more times, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, in total, we have nine instances of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, perhaps I can denote each level as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's let a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082.\n\nContinuing this way, up to a\u2089, and then the final result is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, that's a good way to approach it. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that calculation again for a\u2089. 3*9841: let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000*3 = 27000.\n\n800*3 = 2400.\n\n40*3 = 120.\n\n1*3 = 3.\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, a\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the final result is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. As before, 3*9841=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of levels. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, that corresponds to nine levels inside. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, then each time another 1+3*(...), nine times, and then multiplied by 3. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3*C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n levels, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine levels inside the outermost 3*(...). So, n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the formula for the linear recurrence. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each level is a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is defined based on the previous one, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, by computing each level step by step, we arrived at the final result of 88572. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, we confirmed that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly expanding from the innermost parentheses. By systematically evaluating each level and recognizing the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sum where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). The innermost expression is 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level**:\n   - a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Computation**: Multiply the result of the ninth level by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like it's a repeating pattern, so maybe if I work from the inside out, it'll become clearer.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3(4)). Wait, let me make sure. The next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So yes, it's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now we have 13. Moving one level out again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now we have 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3*40.\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*121.\n\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. Yep, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nHmm, 1093. That's a prime number, I think. Not sure if that's relevant, but just noting.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093: Let me double-check that.\n\n1093 * 3:\n\n3*1000 = 3000\n\n3*90 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, correct. So 3279 +1 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280: Let me compute it step by step to be sure.\n\n3280 * 3:\n\n3000*3=9000\n\n200*3=600\n\n80*3=240\n\nAdding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841.\n\nOkay, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down.\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, adding 1: 29523 +1 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nAdding 1: 88572 +1 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n80000*3=240000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them up: 240000 +24000=264000, plus 1500=265500, plus 210=265710, plus 9=265719.\n\nAdding 1: 265719 +1=265720.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nCalculating 3*265720:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\nAdding them: 600000 +180000=780000, plus 15000=795000, plus 2100=797100, plus 60=797160.\n\nAdding 1: 797160 +1=797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161.\n\nCalculating 3*797161:\n\n700000*3=2100000\n\n90000*3=270000\n\n7000*3=21000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 2100000 +270000=2370000, plus 21000=2391000, plus 300=2391300, plus 180=2391480, plus 3=2391483.\n\nAdding 1: 2391483 +1=2391484.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check how many layers we have here. I think I might have miscounted.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), each time we work our way out, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Let me count the number of parentheses to make sure.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThere are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, each corresponding to a layer. So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I went from (1+3) up to 3*(...) nine times. Let me recount the steps I took.\n\n1. (1+3) =4\n2. 1 + 3*4=13\n3. 1 + 3*13=40\n4. 1 + 3*40=121\n5. 1 + 3*121=364\n6. 1 + 3*364=1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093=3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280=9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841=29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524=88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573=265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720=797161\n13. 1 + 3*797161=2391484\n\nWait, so that's 13 steps? But the original expression only has 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I overcounted. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3*(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, each step working outwards would be 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I had 13 steps. That seems too many. Maybe I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value and moving one layer up.\n\nSo, let's define the innermost as level 1: (1 + 3) =4.\n\nThen level 2: 1 + 3*(level1) =1 +3*4=13.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(level2)=1 +3*13=40.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nNow, after level9, we have the initial 3 multiplying the result. So, the entire expression is 3*(level9).\n\nSo, level9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I went up to 2391484, which is incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3)=4.\n\nLevel2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by level9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nCalculating 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I went beyond level9, which was a mistake because the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to level9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me write out each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\n3. Next:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\n4. Next:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\n5. Next:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I didn't see any mistakes in the calculations this time, so I'm confident that 88572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost 3 by the result of the ninth layer:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer wraps another (1 + 3(...)), and each time it's multiplied by 3. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nAnd it goes on until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s being multiplied. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). So, that's just 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(result from the innermost). So, 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 12). Wait, no, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define each step as a variable to make it easier. Let me denote each nested expression as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous term. Let's say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression has nine layers of 3s, right? Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the 9th layer, then each layer wraps around. So, the total number of layers is 9. So, starting from a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a\u2089 as 29524, but the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). So, the total expression would be 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a\u2081. Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(previous a_i) + 1. So, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, etc., up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(inner expression) + 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner expression). So, perhaps I have the order reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I should index it differently. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the expression, it's (1 + 3*(...)). So, Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1). So, Level 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen Level 3 = 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, Level 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLevel 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLevel 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might have miscounted the levels. Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first innermost is (1 + 3): that's the 9th layer.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(next layer) + 1, but actually, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, perhaps I should visualize it as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this last result, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(4) + 1? Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, each time we go up a layer, we compute 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(9th layer).\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, then the 9th layer is 29524, as I calculated before, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3) + 1? No, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time we add a layer, it's another 1 + 3*(...). So, in the original expression, how many \"1 + 3(...)\" are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, and there are 9 of them, starting from the innermost. So, the 9th layer is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, starting from a\u2081 to a\u2089, each being 1 + 3*a_i, and then the final result is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, yes, 88572 is the result.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a term, then each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me write the recurrence:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe general form is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, the outer expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just cross-verify with another approach. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards, computing each layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like it's a nested expression where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the expression to see the structure better. It's a series of 1 + 3(...) multiplied by 3 each time. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...), and this happens multiple times. Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the inside:\n\n- First layer: 1 + 3\n- Second layer: 1 + 3*(first layer)\n- Third layer: 1 + 3*(second layer)\n- And so on...\n\nLooking at the problem, I can see that it's 9 layers deep. Let me check that:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each step adds another layer. Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the closing parentheses go from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, L1 is the innermost, which is (1+3). Then L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nBut wait, the problem starts with 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on.\n\nSo, let me list each layer from L1 to L9:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm getting the layers right. The innermost is (1+3), which is L1. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(L1), which is L2. Then L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), etc., up to L9, which is the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each L.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again because 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem starts with 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3\" is a layer, and each preceding layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost, the first (1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each 1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count how many times we have \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let me look at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have a \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3) \u2192 1 layer.\n\nThen, moving out, we have (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 2 layers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, in the expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nWait, but the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, each time we have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 layer 2\n\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 layer 3\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( L9 )\n\nWhere L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on, with L1 being (1+3).\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), starting from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to L9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me check: if there are 9 layers, starting from L1 to L9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), then L1 is 4, L2 is 13, L3 is 40, L4 is 121, L5 is 364, L6 is 1093, L7 is 3280, L8 is 9841, L9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step, especially since there are 9 layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo, for L9, which is the 9th layer, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177,147.\n\nThus, 3*L9=(177147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step, and the formula confirms it, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 layer 2\n\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 layer 3\n\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 layer 4\n\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 layer 5\n\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 layer 6\n\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 layer 7\n\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u2192 layer 8\n\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers, which matches the n=9 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each layer is computed as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) starting from the innermost layer.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, repeated multiple times. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). So, the innermost expression is:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(the next step). Let me try to break it down step by step, keeping track of each level.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as levels 1 through 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting with level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, level 2 is 1 + 3*(level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nMoving on to level 3: 1 + 3*(level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this level 9 result. So, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me calculate that. 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that step-by-step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 3*3=9 +2=11, write down 11.\n\nWait, but 29524 has only 5 digits, so after 9, we have 3*3=9, but wait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, each digit:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, so that would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 30,000 *3=90,000. 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 30,000*3=90,000, minus 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, 88,572 is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate levels.\n\nStarting from level 1:\n\n1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation without having to compute each level step by step. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost parentheses. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define the expression starting from the innermost as a1, then a2, up to a9, where each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting with a1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, a2=1+3*a1=1+12=13.\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40.\n\na4=1+3*a3=1+120=121.\n\na5=1+3*a4=1+363=364.\n\na6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093.\n\na7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280.\n\na8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841.\n\na9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n=1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n=1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each level. Therefore, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\na9=(3^{10}-1)/2\n\nSo, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula confirms the step-by-step calculation.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one at a time without getting confused.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. Each time, I should replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4. Let me count how many times (1 + 3) appears. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I need to compute each one step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to break it down layer by layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9. So, the final step is:\n\n3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute this more efficiently without having to calculate each layer.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince there are 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for L9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 times a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start simplifying from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. For each layer, compute the value step by step, keeping track of each layer's result.\n\n3. Notice the pattern and identify it as a linear recurrence relation.\n\n4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a formula for the nth term.\n\n5. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer.\n\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n7. Verify the calculations using an alternative method to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work along the way. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the value of the outermost layer efficiently. \n\nThe solution involves computing each layer step by step, leading to the outermost layer's value, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   Each layer is computed using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and this happens multiple times. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step to make it clearer. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, actually, let me check: each level is 1 + 3*(something). So the structure is like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nWait, maybe I should number each level for clarity. Let me count how many times this nesting occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result)\n\nAnd this continues until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another level. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3))\n\nSo there are nine levels of nesting. That means I need to compute from the innermost (Level 9) up to the outermost (Level 1). Wait, but in the expression, the innermost is actually the last one: 1 + 3. So maybe I should start there.\n\nLet me list each level from the innermost outward. Let me assign Level 1 to the innermost and Level 9 to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out, so let me define each step:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe the other way around. Let me think. The innermost expression is the last one: 1 + 3. So S1 would be 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one level out, S2 would be 1 + 3*S1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen S3 would be 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, in the original expression, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me write down each step carefully.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So that would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that. Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Level 9 result, which is 29524. So 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which gives 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the levels again because I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses to ensure that I have nine levels.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a level. Let's count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, but the last one is just 3(1 + 3), which is the innermost. So actually, the number of levels is 9, which matches the 9 steps I took earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check again: from the innermost, I went up to Level 9, which resulted in 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations for each level to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I misapplied the levels. Because in the original expression, each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I should have started with Level 1 as 1 + 3, then each subsequent level is 3*(previous level + 1). Wait, no, that's not correct because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each level is 3*(1 + 3*(next level)).\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the order. Let me try to re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a recursive function. Let me define f(n) as the value at each level, starting from the innermost. So f(1) = 1 + 3. Then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1), and so on, up to f(9). Then the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So f(1) = 4, f(2) = 13, f(3) = 40, f(4) = 121, f(5) = 364, f(6) = 1093, f(7) = 3280, f(8) = 9841, f(9) = 29524.\n\nThen 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each level seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 13\n\nf(3) = 40\n\nf(4) = 121\n\nf(5) = 364\n\nf(6) = 1093\n\nf(7) = 3280\n\nf(8) = 9841\n\nf(9) = 29524\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern. Let's compute the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\n\n121 / 40 = 3.025\n\n364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\n1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\n3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\n\n9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\n\n29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nHmm, so after the first few terms, each term is approximately 3 times the previous term, which makes sense because each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So for large n, f(n) \u2248 3*f(n-1), but with an additional 1 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 0 = 1 + 2C \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo that's another way to compute it without going through each step, by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:\n\n1. The problem is a nested expression with nine levels of 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. Each level can be computed starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. Each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level), leading up to the ninth level.\n\n4. Using the recurrence relation, we found that the ninth level is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. Multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the total expression, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 3s multiplied by something that involves adding 1 and then multiplying by 3 again. It looks like each step is building on the previous one. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading that correctly. It's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me note that down.\n\nSo, moving out one level, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(result from innermost)\n\nWhich would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next level out is 13. Let me keep track of each step.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(previous result), which is 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now, the next level is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, now we have 121.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 364 is the next value.\n\nNext step: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, moving up, we have 1093.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, now we're at 3280.\n\nNext, moving out another level: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, that's 9841.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, now we're at 29524.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nAlright, so we're now at 88573.\n\nMoving out another level: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573: Let's do this step by step. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nSo, now we're at 265720.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nCalculating 3*265720: Let's see, 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nAlright, so now we have 797161.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost level: 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, 3*797161.\n\nLet me compute that. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nSo, 3*797161 = 2391483.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 797161 * 3 another way. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n797161\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n1\u00d73=3\n6\u00d73=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1\u00d73=3 +1=4\n7\u00d73=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7\u00d73=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\nThere's no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 2391483. Let me check:\n\n797,161 \u00d7 3:\n\n700,000 \u00d7 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 \u00d7 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 \u00d7 3 = 21,000\n\n100 \u00d7 3 = 300\n\n60 \u00d7 3 = 180\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to miscalculate a previous value which would throw off the entire result. Let me go back and check each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. Wait, 3*88,573 is 265,719? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 88,573 \u00d7 3: 80,000 \u00d73 = 240,000; 8,000 \u00d73=24,000; 500\u00d73=1,500; 70\u00d73=210; 3\u00d73=9.\n\nAdding: 240,000 +24,000=264,000 +1,500=265,500 +210=265,710 +9=265,719. So, yes, 1 + 265,719 is 265,720. Correct.\n\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161. Wait, 3*265,720: Let me compute that again.\n\n265,720 \u00d73:\n\n200,000\u00d73=600,000\n\n60,000\u00d73=180,000\n\n5,000\u00d73=15,000\n\n700\u00d73=2,100\n\n20\u00d73=60\n\nAdding: 600,000 +180,000=780,000 +15,000=795,000 +2,100=797,100 +60=797,160. Then 1 + 797,160 = 797,161. Correct.\n\n13. Finally, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483. As we checked earlier, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should count how many times I added 3 and multiplied. Let me see: the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with how many levels? Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each level adds another 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step is another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of times I computed each step.\n\nFrom the innermost, I had 9 levels of 3(...). Let me check:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Then 1+3*(result)\n3. Then 1+3*(result)\n...\nUp to 9 levels?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of steps. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is enclosed in another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times 3 is multiplied by the expression. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1+3))...)).\n\nEach time, it's a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each step adds another 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many times did I compute each step? Let me see:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n12. 1+3*265720=797161\n13. 3*797161=2391483\n\nWait, so I did 12 steps of 1+3*previous result, and then the final step was multiplying by 3. So, that would mean there are 12 nested expressions inside the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, I think the number of nested 1+3(...) is 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another level. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first inner expression is (1+3(...)).\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so the number of times we have 3*(...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 9, each adding another level. So, that would mean we have 9 levels of 1+3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 12 steps of 1+3*(...). That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have (1+3). Then each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of times we do this is equal to the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let's count how many times that occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) \u219213\n3. 1 + 3*(13) \u219240\n4. 1 + 3*(40) \u2192121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) \u2192364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) \u21921093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) \u21923280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) \u21929841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) \u219229524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) \u219288573\n11. 1 + 3*(88573) \u2192265720\n12. 1 + 3*(265720) \u2192797161\n13. 3*(797161) \u21922391483\n\nWait, so that's 12 steps of 1 + 3*(...) and then one final step of multiplying by 3. But in the original expression, how many times does 1 + 3*(...) occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(...)) \u2192 that's the first opening parenthesis.\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(...\n2. Then inside that: (1+3(...\n3. Again: (1+3(...\n4. Again: (1+3(...\n5. Again: (1+3(...\n6. Again: (1+3(...\n7. Again: (1+3(...\n8. Again: (1+3(...\n9. Again: (1+3))\n\nSo, total of 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. That would mean 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 12 steps of 1 + 3*(...). That suggests I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because each time I compute 1 + 3*(...), that's one step, but the number of such steps corresponds to the number of opening parentheses. So, if there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean 9 steps of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I did the calculation, I had 12 steps of 1 + 3*(...). That suggests a discrepancy. Let me try to recount.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices to see how many levels there are.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nInnermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nL10 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nL11 = 1 + 3*L10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nL12 = 1 + 3*L11 = 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n\nThen finally, the entire expression is 3*L12 = 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nSo, that's 12 levels of 1 + 3*(...), which suggests that the original expression has 12 opening parentheses after the initial 3. But when I looked at the original expression, I thought there were 9. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of opening parentheses. Let me count again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is a new level.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. Then inside that: (1 + 3(...\n3. Again: (1 + 3(...\n4. Again: (1 + 3(...\n5. Again: (1 + 3(...\n6. Again: (1 + 3(...\n7. Again: (1 + 3(...\n8. Again: (1 + 3(...\n9. Again: (1 + 3(...\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, it's:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. So, that would mean 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...), right?\n\nBut in my calculation, I ended up with 12 levels.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of times we compute 1 + 3*(...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, which is 9. So, that would mean 9 steps of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 12 steps. That suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of times we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me try that.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each time we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's count those:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n11. 3(\n12. 3(\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the expression only has 9 instances of 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3 followed by (.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each time we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 times. Therefore, there are 9 levels of 3*(...), meaning 9 steps of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 12 steps of 1 + 3*(...). That suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the first step is 1 + 3*(...), which is level 1, and then each subsequent step is another level. So, if there are 9 levels of 3*(...), that would mean 9 steps of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 12 steps, which suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is considered level 0, and then each subsequent step is a new level.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to note that each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of such 3*(...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, which is 9. Therefore, we have 9 steps of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, that would mean:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would contradict my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which itself is 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the levels. Let me try to structure it correctly.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as L1, then each level outward as L2, L3, etc., up to L9, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that's only 88572, which is much less than my earlier result of 2,391,483. That suggests that I'm miscounting the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the original expression has more levels than I thought. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that would mean 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 12 levels, which led to a much larger number. That suggests that perhaps I'm miscounting the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of 3s that are multiplying the nested expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of such 3*(...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, which is 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of times we compute 1 + 3*(...) is 9 times, and then the final result is 3*(result after 9 steps).\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's only 88572, but earlier I had 2,391,483. That suggests that I'm miscounting the number of levels. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the original expression.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem, it's written as:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the number of 3s. Let me try to count the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, each time we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n"

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you should work from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, simplifying each layer as I go.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Maybe I'll label each layer as I go to keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nOkay, so 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1)\n\nWait, let me make sure. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, if Layer 1 is 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2)\n\nSo, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If Layer 3 is 40, then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 4)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 5)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nWait a second, 3*364. Let me verify that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yes, that's correct. So, 1092 +1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 6)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is indeed 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 7)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80? Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 280. So, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWait, let me verify 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 8)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 9)\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me recount the layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis adds a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time it's 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each time we go out a layer, we add another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses: There are 9 closing parentheses after the first 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers? Wait, no, because each layer adds another set of parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I think I may have miscounted earlier. Let me start over, this time correctly labeling each layer as 1 through 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing up to Layer 9, the result is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. I think I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me verify the calculations step by step again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nThis looks like a nested structure where each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. It might be similar to a geometric progression, but I'm not sure if there's a formula that directly applies here because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to the next term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a recursive relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or model it as a recursive function, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1 inside another set of parentheses. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The expression is a series of 3s multiplying expressions that start with 1 and then have another 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next inner expression.\n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the inside and moving outwards. I'll label each step as Step 1, Step 2, etc., so I can keep track.\n\nStep 1: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(Step 1 result). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1 result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nFirst, compute 3*4: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Step 2 result is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Step 2 result). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13\n\nFirst, 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, Step 3 result is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 3 result).\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 4 result is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 4 result).\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 3*121 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, Step 5 result is 364.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Step 5 result).\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let me calculate that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nSo, 3*364 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 6 result is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 6 result).\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break this down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nSo, 3*1093 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 7 result is 3280.\n\nMoving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Step 7 result).\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: Let's calculate this. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 8 result is 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 8 result).\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Step 9 result is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(Step 9 result).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I can see there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, I worked through nine steps, each time computing the next layer.\n\nSo, after Step 9, I have the value inside the outermost parentheses as 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nStep 10: 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nFirst, break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nCompute each part multiplied by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nLet me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer from the inside. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, this method also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that this is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but each term also adds 1, so it's a non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation a_{n+1} = k*a_n + c can be found using standard techniques.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer, 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm absolutely sure that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a nested expression where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 + 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), let's compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost part: (1 + 3)\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one step out, we have 3 times that result. Let's compute that:\n\n2. Next layer: 3(4)\n   - 3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 12. Let's compute that:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12\n   - 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 3 times 13:\n\n4. Next layer: 3(13)\n   - 3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 39:\n\n5.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so each step I took should correspond to one layer. Let me check:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3(4) = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3(13) = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3(40) = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3(121) = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n10. 3(364) = 1092\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. 3(1093) = 3279\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. 3(3280) = 9840\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. 3(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, that's 16 steps, but the original expression only has nine layers. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 +\" is followed by a 3 times something.

Each \"1 +\" is followed by a 3 times another expression, which itself has a similar structure. So the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 +\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression, it's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 +\"s:\n\n1.

Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost, then each layer wraps around it.\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n- The first 1 + 3 is at the start of the innermost part.\n- Then each time, \"1 + 3(\" appears as we move outward.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that there are nine \"1 +\"s, each followed by a 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then 3*(4) = 12\n3. Then 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Then 3*(13) = 39\n5. Then 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Then 3*(40) = 120\n7. Then 1 + 120 = 121\n8.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Then 3*(9841) = 29523\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine layers. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by going beyond nine steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should only compute up to the ninth layer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(...) would be 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers inside, then the outermost 3 would multiply the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is structured as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 12\nLevel 3: 1 + Level 2 = 13\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) = 39\nLevel 5: 1 + Level 4 = 40\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) = 120\nLevel 7: 1 + Level 6 = 121\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) = 363\nLevel 9: 1 + Level 8 = 364\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3*(Level 9). So, if there are nine layers inside, the outermost 3 would be multiplying the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to write the expression step by step, labeling each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*L1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nL3: 1 + L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL4: 3*L3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nL5: 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6: 3*L5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nL7: 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL8: 3*L7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nL9: 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*L9 = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost 3 multiplies the entire inner expression, which after nine layers is 364. So, 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut wait, when I initially counted up to 16 steps, I went beyond that, but maybe the correct number of layers is nine, so the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

So perhaps I was overcomplicating it by going beyond nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"(\" after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"3(\":\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are nine \"3(\" in the expression, which means nine layers of multiplication by 3. Each of these corresponds to a layer we computed up to L9.\n\nTherefore, after computing up to L9 = 364, the outermost 3 multiplies this, giving 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the entire inner expression. So, if the inner expression evaluates to 364, then 3*364 is indeed 1092.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 1092.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this by computing step by step again:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3*4 = 12\n3. Add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n5. Add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n7. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Multiply by 3: 3*121 = 363\n9. Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*364 = 1092\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 1092.\n\nI think earlier I was mistakenly counting beyond nine layers, which led to confusion. But upon careful counting, there are nine layers, each corresponding to a \"3(\" in the original expression, so the final result is indeed 1092.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves adding 1 and multiplying by 3. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{1092}$"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. It seems like a nested expression where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, right? So the innermost part is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the previous layer. So maybe I should start by solving the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around it. So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another 3*(previous layer). So from the innermost, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with Layer 9 being 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside, which is up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me check again. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So in my earlier steps, I calculated Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time computing the inner expression, and then finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So in my calculation above, Layer 9 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but then the outermost 3 is multiplied by that, so the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 30000*3 = 90000, then subtract 476*3 because 29524 is 30000 - 476.\n\nWait, 29524 = 30000 - 476. So 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check 29524*3:\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so 2*10000=20000, so total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that my Layers 1 through 9 are correct. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because 3*(1+3*(...)) nine times seems like it could be a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a first-order linear recurrence, so the solution can be expressed as:\n\na_n = (a_0) * 3^n + (1)/(3 - 1)*(3^n - 1)\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nIn this case, c = 3, d = 1.\n\nSo a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. So maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nUsing the formula for a linear recurrence:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1} * a_1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 3^{k-1} * 1\n\nWait, because each term adds 1 multiplied by 3^{k} where k is the number of steps from that term to a_n.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the solution is:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1} * a_1 + (1)*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1} * 4 + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me compute that for n=9.\n\nSo a_9 = 3^{8} * 4 + (3^{8} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo a_9 = 6561*4 + (6561 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 6561*4: 6561*2=13122, so 13122*2=26244.\n\nThen (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280.\n\nSo a_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this using another approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAlternatively, each layer can be considered as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So after n layers, the value is (3^{n} - 1)/2 + something?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nWait, so maybe the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be considered as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but let me think about it as a sum.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time you have a term that's 3^k, but I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), maybe each term inside is a sum of 3^k from k=0 to some n.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the value step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo the innermost part evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 once more.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, and verifying with the formula for the linear recurrence, I'm confident that the value of the innermost expression after nine layers is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one at a time without getting confused.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. I'll number each set of parentheses from the innermost one to the outermost. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one level out, we have (1+3( result from step 1 )). I'll compute that next.\n3. Continue this process, each time substituting the result from the previous step into the next level out.\n\nLet me start.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, now I can replace the innermost (1+3) with 4. Let me rewrite the expression with this substitution.\n\n**Step 2: Next level out**\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(result from Step 1)).\n\nFrom Step 1, we have result = 4. So, substituting that in:\n\n1 + 3(4)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, the result here is 13. Let me replace this part in the expression.\n\n**Step 3: Next level out**\n\nMoving out another level, the expression becomes (1 + 3(result from Step 2)).\n\nFrom Step 2, result = 13.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n1 + 3(13)\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, the result here is 40. Replacing that part.\n\n**Step 4: Next level out**\n\nNow, the expression is (1 + 3(result from Step 3)).\n\nFrom Step 3, result = 40.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n1 + 3(40)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nResult is 121. Replacing that.\n\n**Step 5: Next level out**\n\nExpression becomes (1 + 3(result from Step 4)).\n\nResult from Step 4 is 121.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n1 + 3(121)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*121 = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nResult is 364. Replacing that.\n\n**Step 6: Next level out**\n\nNow, the expression is (1 + 3(result from Step 5)).\n\nResult from Step 5 is 364.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 + 3(364)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*364 = Let me calculate that.\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nResult is 1093. Replacing that.\n\n**Step 7: Next level out**\n\nExpression becomes (1 + 3(result from Step 6)).\n\nResult from Step 6 is 1093.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 + 3(1093)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*1093: Let me break this down.\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nResult is 3280. Replacing that.\n\n**Step 8: Next level out**\n\nNow, the expression is (1 + 3(result from Step 7)).\n\nResult from Step 7 is 3280.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 + 3(3280)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*3280: Let's calculate.\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nResult is 9841. Replacing that.\n\n**Step 9: Next level out**\n\nMoving out another level, the expression is (1 + 3(result from Step 8)).\n\nResult from Step 8 is 9841.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 + 3(9841)\n\nCompute:\n\n3*9841: Hmm, let me calculate this.\n\nI know that 9841 * 3: Let's break it down.\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nResult is 29524.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when dealing with multiple steps, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n10. Outermost: 3*29524=88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me verify each step quickly.\n\n1. 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI can also think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let's see: the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which seems like a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote each step as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me define a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say a_n is the value at the nth level.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\nUp to a_9, since there are 9 levels of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of parentheses.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new level. Let me count how many times (1+3) appears:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times? Let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3). Each time, it's wrapped in another (1+3(...)) until the 9th level, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, in terms of the recurrence relation, it's a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier in Step 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula also leads to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series could have been another approach. Let me think about that.\n\nEach a_n can be expressed as a sum:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having n terms. Wait, but in our case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's a bit different.\n\nBut using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both methods confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods (step-by-step computation and recurrence relation) both lead to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute the result into the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost expression:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to tackle this step by step. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one at a time without getting overwhelmed.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set starts with 1 + 3(...). So, maybe each time I can compute the innermost part, substitute it back, and then compute the next layer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, let's look at the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. Actually, the innermost parentheses is the last (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number the parentheses for clarity. Let's say the innermost is the 9th one:\n\n9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen moving outwards, the 8th parentheses would be (1 + 3*(result of 9th)).\n\nSo, 8th: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen 7th: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6th: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5th: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n4th: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3rd: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n2nd: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n1st: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I count the number of parentheses correctly? Let me recount because sometimes it's easy to miscount when there are so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the parentheses, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step adds one more layer. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I did the computation, I had 9 steps, each time computing the innermost, so that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the multiplication step again because 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I did the 9th step, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me verify that:\n\n3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we're dealing with expressions of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_result.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so if I have n layers, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 another way.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYep, that's the same result. So, confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's like a tree with each node having a 3 multiplied by its child.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by recursively computing each layer starting from the innermost parentheses, I arrived at the result 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is given by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's a series of 3s and 1s nested inside each other. Each time, you have 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward.\n\n2. Then, moving one step out, it's 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost part.\n\n3. This pattern continues, so each step involves taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and then moving outward.\n\nHmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive process or perhaps find a pattern that repeats. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer would be 3 multiplied by Layer 9 result, but wait, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 9). So actually, the entire expression is 3 times the Layer 9 result.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next inner step), and after 9 layers, we have the innermost 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the result is 29524, as I computed for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me count the number of layers correctly. Each time we have a new 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...1))\n\n3. (1+3(...2))\n\n4. (1+3(...3))\n\n5. (1+3(...4))\n\n6. (1+3(...5))\n\n7. (1+3(...6))\n\n8. (1+3(...7))\n\n9. (1+3(...8))\n\n10. The outermost 3*(...9)\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(result of layer 9).\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n\n- Then moving out, each time it's (1+3(...)), so each layer adds one more. Let's see how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...1))\n\n3. (1+3(...2))\n\n4. (1+3(...3))\n\n5. (1+3(...4))\n\n6. (1+3(...5))\n\n7. (1+3(...6))\n\n8. (1+3(...7))\n\n9. (1+3(...8))\n\n10. The outermost is 3*(...9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I had 9 layers, with the 9th layer being the innermost 1+3. Hmm, maybe I confused the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see.\n\nEach time you have a 1+3*(...), so each layer adds a new 1+3. Let's see how many times this occurs.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1+3*(...) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many 1+3 are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, in total, how many 1+3 are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time you have a 1+3, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...1))\n\n3. (1+3(...2))\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9, which is the innermost, and then the outermost is 3*(...9).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to think of it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the arithmetic again.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the recurrence approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3 operations. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer's result and then multiply the final layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\nAnswer:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check the structure. Each level seems to be 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next innermost result).\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n- Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n- Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, until Level 9.\n\nWait, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of (1+3) parts. Let me see, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new level. So, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 levels of (1+3). Let me confirm:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then each step out adds another (1+3*...)\n3. So, total of 9 levels.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so yes, 9 levels.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's see, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each previous one is built on that. So, I think the innermost is the 9th level, and we work our way out to the first level.\n\nWait, maybe I should number them from the innermost as level 1 to level 9. Let me try that.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Level 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), we have that value, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the innermost is (1+3). So, after computing all the innermost levels up to Level 9, which gives us 29524, then the entire expression is 3 times that. Wait, no, because Level 9 is already the result of the innermost (1+3) working outwards. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in numbering.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, but each step is a level. Let me try again, perhaps I miscounted the levels.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), so that's 4.\n\nThen moving out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(innermost result)).\n\nSo, let's list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing up to the 9th level, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that value, because the original expression is 3*(...).\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but perhaps it's better to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify using another method. Let's break down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), that's level 1: 4.\n\nThen each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level):\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are 9 levels. Let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3) is a new level, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of (1+3):\n\n1. (1+3) at the very end\n2. Next one out: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th one.\n\nSo, yes, 9 levels. Therefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me see if that's applicable here.\n\nEach level is of the form 1 + 3*previous_level, which can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the nth term would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n levels, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of levels is indeed 9. Let me count the number of (1+3) in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), so that's level 1.\n\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1+3(1+3)), so level 2.\n\n3. Next, (1+3(1+3(1+3))), level 3.\n\n4. Continuing until we reach the outermost (1+3(...)), which would be level 9.\n\nYes, that's correct, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each level step by step again.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since each level n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step evaluation and the formula approach give the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe evaluate each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, repeated several times. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. I'll start by identifying the innermost part and work my way outward. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from above). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, no, let me check. Actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let's compute that:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I should think of each step as computing the value inside the parentheses first, then multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, each step is (1 + 3*(next step)). So starting from the innermost, let me list each step.\n\nLet me index the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and this repeats 8 times? Wait, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write each layer as starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So let me compute that as the final step.\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carryover.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 + 1 (carryover) = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5\n\nSo 59048.\n\nThen add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach time, we have a term that is 1 + 3*(previous term). So it's a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which is 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we get a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, we get the result 29524.

So from there, each \"1+3(\" adds a level, so the number of levels is 9, including the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Level 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if the levels are correctly counted. Because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially with so many layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3=1 + 3*a_2=1+39=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na_5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n, which is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found as:\n\na_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 * 3 + something? Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1= C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me check for n=1:\n\na_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computation of 3*29524.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level as follows:\n\n- Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Level 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. Maybe I can solve it by expanding each layer one by one.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let's start there.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, that 4 is inside another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so that's 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40.\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me do this step by step.\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carry over 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo, 9841*3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, carry over 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5*3 = 15, carry over 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28\n- 2*3 = 6 (since 29524 is a 5-digit number, but I think I missed a digit; wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so it's 29 thousand something. So, 29524*3:\n\nLet me compute it correctly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, after 29524, we have 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute 3*88573.\n\n88573 * 3:\n- 3*3 = 9\n- 7*3 =21, write down 1, carry over 2\n- 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1\n- 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 26\n\nWait, let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 =9, write 9.\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carry over 2. But since there are no more digits, write 26.\n\nSo, 88573*3=265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait, no: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nLet me compute 3*265720.\n\n265720 *3:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\n0*3=0\n\nWait, actually, 265720 is 2 6 5 7 2 0.\n\nWait, no, 265720 is 2 6 5 7 2 0, but when multiplied by 3:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, write 1, carry over 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry over 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write 9, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, reading from right to left: 0,6,1,7,9,7.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n265720\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, the result is 797160.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n265720 *3:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000 \u2192 600000+180000=780000\n\n5000*3=15000 \u2192 780000+15000=795000\n\n700*3=2100 \u2192 795000+2100=797100\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 797100+60=797160\n\n0*3=0 \u2192 797160.\n\nSo, yes, 265720*3=797160.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161.\n\nLet me compute 3*797161.\n\n797161*3:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1*3=3\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\n\nNo more digits, so write 2.\n\nWait, let's do it properly:\n\n797161\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n6*3=18, write 8, carry over 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n7*3=21, write 1, carry over 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry over 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write 3, carry over 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carry over 2.\n\nSo, reading from right to left: 3,8,4,1,9,3,2.\n\nWait, that would be 2394183.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n797161 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n700000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000 \u2192 2,100,000 +270,000=2,370,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000 \u2192 2,370,000 +21,000=2,391,000\n\n100*3=300 \u2192 2,391,000 +300=2,391,300\n\n60*3=180 \u2192 2,391,300 +180=2,391,480\n\n1*3=3 \u2192 2,391,480 +3=2,391,483.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got before.

the beginning.\n\nSo, writing it out: 2, then 3, then 9, then 1, then 4, then 8, then 3.\n\nWait, that would be 2,391,483.\n\nYes, that matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, 797161*3=2,391,483.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484.\n\nLet me compute 3*2,391,484.\n\n2,391,484 *3:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n4*3=12,

    "text": " The problem is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s with each step being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part.\n\nLet me write down the expression in a more structured way, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, until Layer 9, since I count 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n\nBut since the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end, maybe I need to compute each step and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps I should compute the innermost part first and work my way out, each time computing the next layer.\n\nSo, let's start:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3). Each time, moving outward, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply it by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (the result of all those layers). So the final result would be 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method to be sure. Let me break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time adding another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, that was the outermost layer, right? Because each layer is built upon the previous one. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric sequence.\n\nEach time, we have a term of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and we have a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^10 is 59049, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence relation, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By breaking down each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next.\n\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3.\n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, right? So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Wait, no, looking back at the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3s. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. Let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(result of 1)\n3. 1+3*(result of 2)\n4. 1+3*(result of 3)\n5. 1+3*(result of 4)\n6. 1+3*(result of 5)\n7. 1+3*(result of 6)\n8. 1+3*(result of 7)\n9. 1+3*(result of 8)\n10. Finally, multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers where we compute 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost 3 multiplies that.\n\nWait, maybe I should list each step from the innermost outwards.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, starting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost part is 3*(S9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, in my initial breakdown, I had S1 through S9, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the outermost 3 multiplies S9.\n\nWait, but let me check each S value again:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check S9 again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each step as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1).\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, the solution is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where r is the common ratio.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no, wait, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nYes, so the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when the equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation of a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the formula approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since each term depends on the previous one, the formula approach seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute each step manually, as I did before, I get the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result:\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. The outermost layer is 3 times the last result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
