    "text": " Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. So, it's a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together in a repetitive way. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outwards because that's how parentheses usually work, right? You solve the innermost ones first and then move outward.\n\nLet me try to identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part seems to be the last one: 1 + 3. So, that would be the starting point.\n\nLet me write down each step as I go along. Maybe I can number them or something to keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That should be 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, so I replaced the last (1 + 3) with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next innermost parentheses would be the one just before that, which is 1 + 3(1 + 4). Hmm, that might be a bit more complex. Let me compute that.\n\n2. Compute the next innermost: 1 + 3(1 + 4). First, compute the inner part: 1 + 4 = 5. Then multiply by 3: 3 * 5 = 15. Now, add 1: 1 + 15 = 16.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 16)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, the part I just computed was 1 + 3(1 + 4) = 16, so the next level out is 1 + 3(16). Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I replace a part, I can think of it as moving one layer out.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. So, I might need to compute each one step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to list each step with the corresponding layer.\n\n1. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n4. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n6. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n8. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n9. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(Layer 1)\n\nWait, so maybe I should label each layer from the innermost as Layer 9 up to Layer 1, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is Layer 0 or something. Let me try this approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Layer 8 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 7 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 4 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 3 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 2 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdd them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 1 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost operation is multiplying this result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nCompute that:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back through each layer to verify.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it seems like each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, starting from Layer 9 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nIn fact, this seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed with a formula.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of Layer n.\n\nWe have:\n\nL_9 = 4\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_9\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\n...\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd the total result is 3*L_1\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me write the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, for n = 1, 2, ..., 9\n\nWith L_9 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n+1} = 0, but that seems a bit off because the indices are reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it in terms of L_{n+1}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nWait, actually, that's a bit unusual because typically we express L_{n+1} in terms of L_n. Maybe I can rearrange it.\n\nLet me rewrite the recurrence as:\n\nL_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3\n\nThat might make it easier to handle.\n\nSo, starting from L_9 = 4, we can compute L_8, L_7, etc., using L_{n} = (L_{n+1} - 1)/3\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, we computed L_8 as 1 + 3*L_9, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. But if I use the rearranged formula, L_8 = (L_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 3/3 = 1, which contradicts our earlier result. Hmm, that can't be right. So, maybe I made a mistake in rearranging.\n\nWait, let's see. The original equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nSo, to express L_{n+1} in terms of L_n, we can subtract 1 and divide by 3:\n\nL_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3\n\nWait, but when n=9, L_9 = 4. Then L_8 = (L_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1, but earlier we had L_8 = 13, which is way off. So, that suggests that perhaps my rearrangement is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIf L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, then to find L_{n} in terms of L_{n-1}, we can substitute n with n-1:\n\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_n\n\nSo, L_n = (L_{n-1} - 1)/3\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, starting from L_9 = 4, then L_8 = (L_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1, which contradicts our earlier calculation where L_8 was 13. So, that can't be right. Therefore, maybe I should not try to find a closed-form solution but stick to the step-by-step approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how I set up the recurrence. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to see that each layer is built by 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each outer layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, for example, layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 7 is 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, in that case, the recurrence is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, starting from L_9 = 4.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct way to express it is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, which is a bit non-standard because we usually express L_{n+1} in terms of L_n. But perhaps I can still find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each step is a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the computed layers:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 13\n\nLayer 7: 40\n\nLayer 6: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 4: 1093\n\nLayer 3: 3280\n\nLayer 2: 9841\n\nLayer 1: 29524\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern in these numbers.\n\nFrom Layer 9 to Layer 8: 4 to 13. The difference is 9.\n\nLayer 8 to Layer 7: 13 to 40. Difference is 27.\n\nLayer 7 to Layer 6: 40 to 121. Difference is 81.\n\nLayer 6 to Layer 5: 121 to 364. Difference is 243.\n\nLayer 5 to Layer 4: 364 to 1093. Difference is 729.\n\nLayer 4 to Layer 3: 1093 to 3280. Difference is 2187.\n\nLayer 3 to Layer 2: 3280 to 9841. Difference is 6561.\n\nLayer 2 to Layer 1: 9841 to 29524. Difference is 19683.\n\nHmm, these differences are 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683.\n\nWait a minute, those are powers of 3:\n\n9 = 3^2\n\n27 = 3^3\n\n81 = 3^4\n\n243 = 3^5\n\n729 = 3^6\n\n2187 = 3^7\n\n6561 = 3^8\n\n19683 = 3^9\n\nSo, the differences between each layer are 3^(n+1), where n starts at 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me find a closed-form formula, but it's interesting to note.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each layer can be expressed as (3^{k} - 1)/2, but let me test that.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nIf k = 3: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is Layer 8, not 9.\n\nWait, maybe it's shifted.\n\nWait, Layer 9 is 4, which is (3^2 + 1)/2 = (9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Layer n = (3^{10 - n} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for Layer 9:\n\n(3^{10 - 9} - 1)/2 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which isn't 4.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 9 = 4, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nIf I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1} and express it in terms of L_{n+1}, but I think that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the total expression:\n\nTotal = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWith nine layers of 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's equivalent to 3 times the sum of 3^k from k=0 to 9, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about it.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)))\n\nWait, but with nine layers, maybe it's 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 )\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute (3^9 - 1)/2 and then multiply by 3.\n\n3^9 is 19683, so (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but our Layer 1 was 29524, which is one more than that. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the total is 3*( (3^9 + 1)/2 )\n\nWait, (3^9 + 1)/2 = (19683 + 1)/2 = 19684/2 = 9842.\n\nThen, 3*9842 = 29526, which is still not matching our result of 29524.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 3*( (3^9 - 3)/2 + 1 )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n(3^9 - 3)/2 = (19683 - 3)/2 = 19680/2 = 9840.\n\nThen, 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523, which is still not matching 29524.\n\nWait, but our final result was 3*29524 = 88572, which came from 3*(Layer 1) where Layer 1 was 29524.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is 3*( (3^{n} - 1)/2 ), where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, with n=9, (3^9 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, then 3*9841 = 29523, which is one less than our Layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the formula is 3*( (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 )\n\nWait, for n=9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly Layer 1.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Layer1 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So, perhaps the formula is:\n\nTotal = 3*( (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 ), where n is the number of layers.\n\nIn our case, n=9 layers, so it's 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nThat's a much quicker way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step.\n\nSo, that's probably the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident in this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, the expression can be simplified using the formula for a geometric series, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: Start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Compute each layer outward**: Each subsequent layer is calculated by substituting the result of the inner layer into the expression, continuing outward until the outermost layer is reached.\n\n3. **Recognize the pattern**: The expression follows a geometric progression where each layer can be represented using powers of 3.\n\n4. **Apply the geometric series formula**: The final value of the outermost layer before the multiplication by 3 is found using the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers (9 in this case).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The final step is to multiply the result by 3 to get the total value.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I guess I'll have to work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of 3 multiplied by a sum that includes another 3 multiplied by another sum, and so on. It looks like a repeated pattern, which might mean that there's a recursive element here or maybe a geometric series? Hmm, not sure yet, but let's try expanding it step by step.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out one layer, it's (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(40)). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's 121. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(121)):\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 364. Then moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(364)):\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, 1093. Next layer is (1 + 3*(1093)):\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3280. Then, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(3280)):\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(9841)):\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 29524. Then, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(29524)):\n\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nHmm, 88573. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(88573)):\n\n1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, 265720. Then, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(265720)):\n\n1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, that's 797161. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(797161)):\n\n1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nHmm, 2391484. Then, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(2391484)):\n\n1 + 3*2391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nWait, 7174453. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(7174453)):\n\n1 + 3*7174453 = 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nHmm, 21523360. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result:\n\n3*(21523360) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 21523360 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n21523360 * 3:\nFirst, 20,000,000 * 3 = 60,000,000\nThen, 1,523,360 * 3 = 4,570,080\nAdding them together: 60,000,000 + 4,570,080 = 64,570,080.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because that number seems quite large, and maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think there are 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I started from the innermost and worked outwards, which should be 9 layers. Let me check how many steps I did:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the next layer would be (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n11. Then, (1 + 3*88573) = 265720\n12. Then, (1 + 3*265720) = 797161\n13. Then, (1 + 3*797161) = 2391484\n14. Then, (1 + 3*2391484) = 7174453\n15. Then, (1 + 3*7174453) = 21523360\n16. Finally, 3*21523360 = 64,570,080\n\nWait, but if the expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), then perhaps I went one layer too far? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is one layer.\n\nThen each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, as the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, so in my calculation above, I went up to 16 steps, but maybe I should have stopped at 9 layers, meaning that the outermost layer would be the 9th (1 + 3(...)), and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me write each step clearly, numbering them from 1 to 9.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value inside is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n24 * 3 = 72\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572. But earlier, when I continued beyond 9 layers, I got 64,570,080, which seems way too big. So, perhaps I made a mistake by going beyond the 9 layers.\n\nWait, so if the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) then it's 3 times a sum that has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the main expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, I should compute 9 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*(previous result)), and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nSo, let's do that again step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that accurately.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I continued beyond 9 layers, I got a much larger number, which was 64,570,080, but that must have been incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation again because 29,524 * 3 seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of expanding each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form (1 + 3 * previous_value). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. It seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I think 88,572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this approach. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), and there are 9 such layers. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   3. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   4. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   5. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   6. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   7. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   8. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   9. & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the outside, the first parenthesis is 1+3(...), then inside that another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the outside, each time there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied. Hmm, let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, it's 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s. The first one is the outermost 3, then inside that, there are 8 more 3s, making it a total of 9 layers? Wait, no, maybe it's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking the innermost expression, computing it, then moving outwards. So let's go step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer from innermost to outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3. So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo yes, that gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So the innermost is (1+3), then each time we add a layer until the outermost 3*(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each time there's a (1 + 3*(...)). Let's count the number of times this happens.\n\nI think there are 9 layers in total, including the outermost 3. Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), which is the first layer, then inside that, another 8 layers. Wait, no, maybe I should count the number of 3s multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a nested structure. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see how many times this happens.\n\nI think the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each time moving out, it's another layer. So from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. Each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds one more. Wait, maybe it's better to write out each layer step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time moving out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So let me list each layer as I did before, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, I went up to layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check again if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then inside that another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time we have a (1+3(...)), so starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time moving out, it's another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I calculated up to layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, it's 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it directly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, this formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9=29524, and then the outermost layer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost layer is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by something inside another set of parentheses. It seems like a repetitive pattern, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(...)). The inner part we just computed is 4, so this becomes (1 + 3*4).\n\nWait, let me check: Is it 3 multiplied by the inner expression? Yes, because it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, yes, each layer is 3 times the next inner expression plus 1.\n\nSo, step 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3).\n\nThat's 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 4).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5).\n\nThat's 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 6).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7).\n\nThat's 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 8).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9).\n\nWhich is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Maybe I should write each step clearly.\n\nLet me number each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times (1+3 is present.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? Because each time you add another (1+3(...)), so the expression is 3*(layer9). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nBut maybe another way to think about it is that this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but that seems like a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier in step 9. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nIn this problem, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, so n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that can be expressed using a recursive formula. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. \n\nUsing the recursive formula $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$ with $a_1 = 4$, we find that each layer can be expressed as $a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. \n\nFor the 9 layers in the problem, $a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Each one seems to be multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that part with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So now, that part simplifies to 13. I can replace that section with 13. \n\nMoving another level out, the next expression is again 1 + 3*(the previous result). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that part is now 40.\n\nI think I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the result from the inner expression, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me try to do this step by step for each level. Maybe I can list them out to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. I'll go through each level again to verify.\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Level 10: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. So, starting from the innermost, each layer builds upon the last. \n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. It seems like each time, it's a recursive process where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, if I consider the innermost term as a starting point, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's interesting. If I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without expanding each step.\n\nLet me try to model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the initial condition a_1 = 4 (from the innermost 1 + 3). \n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, and then we'd find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is the homogeneous plus the particular: a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each term a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That's correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct again.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Yep, that's right.\n\nn = 4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each level, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the level number starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nNow, how many levels do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level. Starting from the innermost, which is level 1, each subsequent level adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine more 3s inside the parentheses. Each 3 corresponds to a level. So, starting from the innermost as level 1, there are 9 levels. Wait, let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(...)\", starting from the innermost. So, that would make 9 levels. Therefore, the outermost level is level 9. So, when we compute a_9, that would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nUsing the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. \n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again just to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. So, let's see, the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...), each time multiplied by 3. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, it'll become manageable.\n\nLet me try to identify the innermost expression. The very last part is (1 + 3). So, starting there:\n\nFirst layer (innermost):\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\nSecond layer:\n1 + 3*(result from first layer) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThird layer:\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(result from second layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nFourth layer:\nNext, it's 1 + 3*(result from third layer) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth layer:\nContinuing this way, 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, yes. So, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nSixth layer:\nNow, 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first.\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer:\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's do 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nEighth layer:\nNext, 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer:\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nTenth layer:\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from ninth layer) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(...), and each layer inside is 1 + 3*(...). So, after the ninth layer, which was 29524, that's inside another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was correct earlier, but I thought the ninth layer was the innermost, but actually, the outermost is another 3*(...). So, let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, nine times. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, each time, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo, 2*10000=20000.\n\n9*1000=9000.\n\n5*100=500.\n\n2*10=20.\n\n4*1=4.\n\nNow, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4.\n\nCompute each:\n\n3*20000=60000.\n\n3*9000=27000.\n\n3*500=1500.\n\n3*20=60.\n\n3*4=12.\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in adding up the parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a formula. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term to avoid computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think about it. The innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a pattern here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, maybe my step-by-step calculation was correct after all.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis adds another layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...) in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a_9, which is 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Second Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Third Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Fourth Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Fifth Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Sixth Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Seventh Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Eighth Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Ninth Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that start with 1 and then have another 3 times something inside. It seems like each layer is similar, just with one fewer set of parentheses. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nLet me start by labeling each part to keep track. Let's see, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, that result will be multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n3. I'll keep doing this, moving outward each time, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me try writing this out step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, plugging in 4:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNext layer out is another 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So:\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nContinuing outward, next layer:\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, seems okay.\n\nMoving outward:\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That seems big, but okay.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Hmm, that's a big number, but I guess it's correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's getting really large.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's a huge number, but okay.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\nStep 10: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, 3 times 29524 is 88572. So, that would be the final result.\n\nWait a second, let me check if I did all the steps correctly. It's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each step again, maybe writing it down:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of times 3(...) appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1 and the next layer.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after each 1.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the 9th layer, I think. Let me see:\n\nEach time you have 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nThen the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, perhaps I have 9 layers inside the outer 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost layer. Let's count the number of 3s after each 1:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is 9, because each 3 is followed by another layer until the 9th time, and then the outermost 3.\n\nWait, so maybe I have 9 layers inside, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me try computing each layer again, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, so:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*Layer9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before, 88,572. So maybe that's correct.\n\nBut let me try another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a recursive formula. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each step again using the formula.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the answer.\n\nI think I got it right. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped me confirm the result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move one layer out and compute:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4.

    "text": " Let me try to figure it out.\n\nThe problem is: Compute \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how many layers there are. I count nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, it's like a chain of operations, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but let's go on. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, okay, so it's growing quite rapidly. Let me keep going step by step.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems correct.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the innermost parentheses gave me 4, then each subsequent layer gave me 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524.\n\nBut wait, let me check how many layers I have. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(that result). So, the outermost operation is 3*(29524).\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works for the first few terms. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4.

Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, compute the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 multiplied by something else. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. So starting from the inside:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3(4) is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3(13).\n\n3 times 13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nOkay, so that becomes 40. Next level out, it's 1 + 3(40).\n\n3 times 40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nHmm, so now we have 121. Next, moving out, it's 1 + 3(121).\n\n3 times 121 is... let me calculate that. 120 times 3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWait, 364? That seems a bit big, but okay. Let's continue.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3(364). So 3 times 364 is... 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nWow, that's getting large. Next, moving out another level: 1 + 3(1093).\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nOkay, so now it's 3280. Next level out: 1 + 3(3280).\n\nCalculating 3*3280. Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nThat's a big number, but okay. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3(9841).\n\nSo 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWow, that's huge. Next, moving out another level: 1 + 3(29524).\n\nCalculating 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nOkay, so now we're at 88573. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer: 3(88573). So 3 times 88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000+24000=264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 88573 * 3.\n\n88573\nx    3\n--------\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, carryover 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo writing it down: 265719.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and each time the number got significantly larger. So finally, after computing all those layers, the result is 265719.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Starting from (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So I did:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYep, that seems to cover all nine layers of parentheses. So I think I did this correctly. Each step, I just took the previous result, multiplied by 3, added 1, and repeated until I got to the outermost layer. Then I multiplied that final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each step manually. Maybe something with geometric series or recursion? Let me think.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So it's a recursive expression. Let me denote each term as a_n, where n is the depth of the nesting.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nWait, because a_1 corresponds to n=1, so a_9 is when n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, after computing a_9, we have to multiply by 3, right? Because the original expression is 3*(a_9).\n\nSo let me compute a_9 first.\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's the same as what I got earlier when I computed step by step: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nBut wait, according to the formula, a_9 = 29524, but in my step-by-step, a_9 was 88573. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the indexing. Let me check.\n\nIn the problem, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another layer. So let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the LaTeX code:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are 8 more 1+3( before the last )))))).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1+3(...). So each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 this is the outermost, which is layer 9? Wait, no, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times you can expand the parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1+3(, which is another layer. So each time, the number of layers increases by 1.\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\n- The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another layer: 1+3(1+3(...))\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3): layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each time we have a new layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So the total number of layers inside is 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to a_9 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIf I consider n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had a_9 = 88573, which is different. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me check.\n\nIn the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost. So a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 88573.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, a_9 was 88573, which is 3 times 29524 plus 1? Wait, 3*29524 = 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So that makes sense.\n\nWait, so maybe the formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the value before multiplying by 3 in the outermost layer.\n\nSo in the problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 265719. That's because I continued multiplying by 3 beyond the a_9.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nSo in terms of the a_n I defined, a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, ..., a_9 = 88573.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nBut wait, in my step-by-step, a_9 was 88573, which is 3*a_8 +1.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is off because I started with a_1 =4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nWait, so according to the formula, a_9=29524, but in my step-by-step, I had a_9=88573, which is 3*29524 +1=88573.\n\nWait, so that suggests that in my step-by-step, I was actually computing a_{10}.\n\nBecause a_9=29524, then a_{10}=1 +3*a_9=1 +3*29524=88573.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression only has nine layers, so a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I went up to a_9=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nSo perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me recount the layers in the problem.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo let's count the number of 1 + 3( in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(.\n\nSo the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each time we have 1 + 3(...\n\nLet me see: starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1 + 3(...), which is layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another 1 + 3(...), layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is layer 9.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another layer. So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3).\n\nThen each time we move out, we add another layer. So how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the expression, starting from the innermost, there are nine 1 + 3( before the last )))))).\n\nWait, no, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1+3(...), which is layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another 1+3(...), layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed up to a_9=88573, which is actually layer 10, because I started counting from layer 1 as (1+3)=4, then layer 2=13, etc., up to layer 9=88573.\n\nWait, so if the problem has nine layers, then a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to a_9=88573, which is actually a_{10}.\n\nTherefore, I think I miscounted the number of layers. The problem has nine layers, so a_9=29524, and the answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1+3)=4 (layer 1)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (layer 2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (layer 3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (layer 4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (layer 5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (layer 6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (layer 7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (layer 8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (layer 9)\n10. 1+3*29524=88573 (layer 10)\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nSo in my step-by-step, I went up to layer 10, but the problem only has nine layers. Therefore, the correct computation should stop at layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4 (layer 1).\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo layer 1: 4\n\nlayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nlayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nlayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nlayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nlayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nlayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nlayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nlayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo in my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly went one layer too far, computing layer 10 and then multiplying by 3, leading to 265719, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers.\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), up to layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo layer9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to layer9=88573, which is actually layer10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nSo I think I miscounted the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has nine layers, so starting from (1+3), which is layer1, up to layer9, which is a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with the formula.\n\nWe have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by computing one extra layer.\n\nSo the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by computing the layers again.\n\nStarting from layer1: (1+3)=4.\n\nlayer2: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nlayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nlayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nlayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nlayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nlayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nlayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nlayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo I think my initial mistake was that I continued one layer too far, thinking that the outermost layer was layer10, but actually, the problem only has nine layers inside the 3*(...), so it's layer9=29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen moving out, each time we have 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1 + 3(...), which is layer1.\n\nThen inside that, another 1 + 3(...), layer2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is layer9.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer10=88573, which is actually layer10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nSo I think the confusion arises from whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not.\n\nIn the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the nine-layer expression.\n\nTherefore, the nine layers are inside the 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nTherefore, layer9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's the right approach.\n\nSo to summarize, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, gives a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I just need to be careful about how I'm counting the layers and whether the outermost multiplication by 3 is part of the layer count or not.\n\nSo, final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can simplify it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

It seems like a series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times something else. Let me try to parse it from the inside out, since that's how nested expressions usually work.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, so now we have 121. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me work that out.\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo that's 1093. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's see.\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nHmm, 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me figure that out.\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo that's 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nAlright, so that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*88573 = 265,719\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check how many layers there are because I might have miscounted. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nInnermost: (1+3) \u2192 1 layer\nNext: 1+3*(4) \u2192 2 layers\nThen: 1+3*(13) \u2192 3 layers\nThen: 1+3*(40) \u2192 4 layers\nThen: 1+3*(121) \u2192 5 layers\nThen: 1+3*(364) \u2192 6 layers\nThen: 1+3*(1093) \u2192 7 layers\nThen: 1+3*(3280) \u2192 8 layers\nThen: 1+3*(9841) \u2192 9 layers\nThen: 1+3*(29524) \u2192 10 layers\nFinally, the outermost 3*(result) \u2192 11 layers\n\nWait, so maybe I went one layer too far? Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we have 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses. So that would mean 9 layers inside, each time adding 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524), right?\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the 9th layer, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 265,719, but that was when I went one layer too far. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo that's 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each time adding a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the outermost 3 is multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 265,719, but that was when I mistakenly included an extra layer. So perhaps the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times we have 1+3(...) is 9 times, each time nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times '1+3' appears inside the parentheses.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nAfter 3(, the first ( is at 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another (.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3( is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nSo, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, starting with 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, which would be a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\na_0 = C*3^0 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 1 \u2192 C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9, since we have 9 layers after the initial 3*(...).\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: iterative computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_0 = 1 \\). The closed-form solution for \\( a_n \\) is \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. Let me try to write it out step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left, each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), so let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Let me check:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the ninth one.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\nThe first part is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost part is 1 + 3, which doesn't have any more parentheses. So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is just 4.\n2. Then moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n3. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n4. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(354)) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(3189)) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n6. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(28704)) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339.\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(258,339)) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n8. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(2,325,054)) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(20,925,489)) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(188,329,404)) = 3*(1 + 564,988,212) = 3*564,988,213.\n\nWait, did I count that right? Because the problem starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is 1+3, which is 4, then each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So perhaps there are 9 layers after the initial 3, making it 10 layers total? Hmm, maybe I overcounted.\n\nWait, let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me try to list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems more manageable. So perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier. Let me try to compute each step carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStep 1: Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nStep 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(29,524) = 88,572\n\nWait, so the final result is 88,572? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364: 364*3=1,092; 1 + 1,092=1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1,093: 1,093*3=3,279; 1 + 3,279=3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3,280: 3,280*3=9,840; 1 + 9,840=9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9,841: 9,841*3=29,523; 1 + 29,523=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29,524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo let's compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I think I've got it right. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, computing each layer step by step. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time. Let me just do one more check on a couple of steps.\n\nFor example, a_5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 3*364 = 1,092; 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 3*1,093 = 3,279; 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 3*3,280 = 9,840; 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 3*9,841 = 29,523; 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd finally, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlright, I think that's solid. So the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again.\n\n29524*3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3(...). Each layer should have one more closing parenthesis than the previous. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n- The first 3( is followed by 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( L1 )\n\nWhere L1 = 1 + 3( L2 )\n\nL2 = 1 + 3( L3 )\n\n...\n\nUp to L9 = 1 + 3( L10 )\n\nWait, but that can't be because the innermost is (1+3), which is L10? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(1+3))\n\nSo, that's 9 \"1+3(\" instances, meaning 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to L9, which would be 9 layers, right? So, L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to L9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again the layers:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted because the innermost is (1+3), which is L1, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from L1 as innermost, and working outwards.\n\nWait, let me list each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer is correctly computed, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check one more time with a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or using a formula.\n\nLet me see. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\).\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\).\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\).\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\).\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\).\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\).\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\).\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like there are multiple layers here, so maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3 times something. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time you add another 3(...), and I can count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the very inside:\n\n- The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each time, it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so that's the next layer.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, you have a new layer, so how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result from 3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result from 4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result from 5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result from 6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result from 7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result from 8)\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(result from 9)\n\nWait, that's 10 layers. But when I count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) parts, let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of times 3 is multiplied is 9 times, because the innermost is just (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, maybe there are 9 layers of 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms:\n\n1. The first 3*(1 + ...)\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), no 3*(...) here, just 1 + 3.\n\nThen moving outward:\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. Each time, you have another 3*(1 + ...), so let's count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let me define each step as a variable to keep track.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, until a\u2089, and then the final result is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, but how many terms do we have? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is a\u2081.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*a_i, so a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\n...\n\nUp to a\u2089, because from the expression, after the innermost, we have 8 more layers, making it 9 layers, right? Wait, maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on until we have 9 layers, so a\u2081 to a\u2089, and then the outermost 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\nCompute a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again:\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out more carefully.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3 is actually 88572.\n\nWait, let me check with another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating a\u2089.\n\nLet me go back through each a_i step by step to check for any errors.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, each a_i is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_i = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen i=1, a\u2081 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_i, it's (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, let's test this with i=1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\ni=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\ni=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a\u2089, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

It seems like a series of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression, but perhaps with some parentheses labeled to make it clearer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n3. Then, moving another level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 2)), and so on.\n\nSo, essentially, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). There are multiple levels here, so I need to compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first layer.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine sets of parentheses. Each set adds another layer. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nAnd so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's eight layers? Because starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3( parts:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 the first 1+3( is the innermost, which is (1+3), then the next is 1+3*(innermost), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times we have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\nLevel 1: (1+3)\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1))\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2))\n...\nAnd this continues until Level 8, because each time we add another layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3*(Level 8). So, perhaps there are 8 layers inside, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to index them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. A1 = 1 + 3\n2. A2 = 1 + 3*A1\n3. A3 = 1 + 3*A2\n4. A4 = 1 + 3*A3\n5. A5 = 1 + 3*A4\n6. A6 = 1 + 3*A5\n7. A7 = 1 + 3*A6\n8. A8 = 1 + 3*A7\n9. A9 = 1 + 3*A8\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(A9). So, actually, there are 9 layers inside the 3*(...). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and there are 9 layers. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have (1 + 3*(previous)).\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3( occurs:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1+3(, so let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by the first (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(next (1+3(...)))\n- So, each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( substrings:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 the first 1+3( starts at the first character after 3(.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3, each 1+3( adds another layer, and the innermost is (1+3), so total layers would be 8.\n\nWait, maybe I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the 3, we have:\n\n1.

Hmm, but the innermost is (1+3), which is 1+3 without a parenthesis. Wait, no, the innermost is (1+3), which is one opening and one closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me list each level with their computed values:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just verify each step again, because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing exponentially, and 3^9 is 19683, which is less than 88572. Hmm, but each step is 1 + 3*previous, so it's a linear recurrence, not exponential. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about solving this recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form formula, which might help verify the result.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, so the solution can be found using the method for such equations.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is the particular solution.\n\nLet's find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 Correct, matches Level 1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2192 Correct, Level 2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct, Level 3.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct, Level 4.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct, Level 5.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct, Level 6.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct, Level 7.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct, Level 8.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct, Level 9.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step again, but perhaps using the formula to compute each level.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it step by step, but that might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression as a sum of powers of 3, using the formula.\n\nWait, since each level is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then at level 9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous), which can be expressed as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis seems like a geometric series, but perhaps I can model it as such.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with each step. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms that the value at the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So, it's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something), and that something is another 1 plus 3 times something else, and so on. I think it's a nested expression where each level is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out.\n\nLet me start by identifying how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, it seems like there are 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe there are 9 layers? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside each parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute that.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, let's list each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but let's keep going.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the innermost is L1=4, then L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*       3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, so 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, so 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, so the total would be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the 3, there's a (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is an additional (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to L9, which would be 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because when I count the number of layers, perhaps I should include the initial 3*(...), which would make it 10 layers? Wait, no, because each layer is inside the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of (1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's see:\n\nEach time you have a (1 + 3*(...)), so from the innermost, that's one layer, then each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3*(...)\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3*(, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3*(...)), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer up to layer 9, then the outermost 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, that would mean that I computed correctly up to layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computations again because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times seems like a lot, and the numbers are growing exponentially.\n\nWait, let me try to compute each layer step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, but since the problem is to compute it step by step, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a recursive relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form is L(n) = a*r^n + b, where r is the common ratio and b is a constant term.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L(9), it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the closed-form formula.\n\nSince L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*L(9) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L(9) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_i \\) starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3 times a whole bunch of nested expressions, each one being 1 plus 3 times something. Specifically, it's written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... and this goes on nine times. Hmm, so it's like a chain of these 1 + 3( something ) expressions.\n\nLet me try to write it out more clearly to see the structure. The outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). Inside that, it's 1 + 3 times another similar expression, and this repeats nine times. So, it's like a recursive expression where each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. That might be a bit confusing, but maybe I can compute it step by step from the inside out.\n\nLet me start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next one, and the last one would just be 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that level gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3 * 13. Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that's 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level would be 1 + 3 times 40. Let's see: 3 * 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3 * 121. 3 * 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3 * 364. 3 * 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3 * 1093. 3 * 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3 * 3280. 3 * 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nContinuing, 1 + 3 * 9841. 3 * 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNext, 1 + 3 * 29524. 3 * 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check how many levels we're dealing with. The original problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times. So, each time we compute a level, we're moving one step out. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's level 1, then level 2 is 1 + 3*(level1), and so on until level 9. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies the result of level 9.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I got to level 9 as 88573, and then the outermost 3 would multiply that. So, 3 * 88573. Let me compute that: 3 times 80,000 is 240,000, 3 times 8,000 is 24,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 73 is 219. So adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000, plus 1,500 is 265,500, plus 219 is 265,719.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, then each step out is another level. So, when I computed up to 88573, that was the ninth level, right? Because starting from 1 + 3, that's level 1, then level 2 is 1 + 3*(level1), up to level 9. So, then the outermost 3 is multiplying level9, which is 88573, giving 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the levels correctly. The expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times. So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a level, and the closing parentheses would correspond to each level. So, starting from the innermost, each time I compute one level, I move out one. So, 1 + 3 is level1, then 1 + 3*(level1) is level2, and so on until level9. So, yes, I think I did it right.\n\nBut maybe I should verify each step carefully to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, hold on, in my earlier calculation, I had Level9 as 88573, but now I'm getting 29524. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast this. Maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me start over more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each level step by step, from the innermost to the outermost, and see where I went wrong.\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Level9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier 265,719. So, I think I miscounted the levels before. It looks like Level9 is 29,524, not 88,573. So, then the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this again because I'm getting conflicting results. Let me recount the levels:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, with nine levels, each time building upon the previous.\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Level9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88573 at Level9, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, Level9 is 29524, and 3 times that is 88,572.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should check each step again to be thorough.\n\nLet me go through each level step by step.\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Level9 is 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29,524.\n\nCalculating 3*29,524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 88,573, but that must have been a mistake. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each level, which might be more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nLet me think about this. Each level is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n levels, the result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine levels inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost expression is level1, and the outermost is level9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost is 3*(level9). So, level9 is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3^{10} is 59,049.\n\nSo, 3^{10} - 1 = 59,048.\n\nThen, (59,048)/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nThat matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without expanding each level, which is much faster and less error-prone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step from the innermost part outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way out. Each level is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous level)}\\).\n\n1. **Innermost level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each part seems to be of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n4. I think this pattern continues, each time taking the previous result and plugging it into the next layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there exactly? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. From the expression, I can see that there are nine opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. So that means there are nine layers. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(result 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result 2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result 3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result 4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result 5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result 6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result 7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result 8)\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(result 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each step one by one.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Compute innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Then compute next layer: 1 + 3*(result1)\n3. Then compute next layer: 1 + 3*(result2)\n4. Continue this until the ninth layer.\n5. Finally, multiply the ninth result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each step.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result1) = 1 + 3*4\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(result2) = 1 + 3*13\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(result3) = 1 + 3*40\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(result4) = 1 + 3*121\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(result5) = 1 + 3*364\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(result6) = 1 + 3*1093\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(result7) = 1 + 3*3280\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(result8) = 1 + 3*9841\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing the ninth layer, we get 29524. The entire expression is 3*(result9), so we need to multiply this by 3.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524\nLet me calculate that. 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\nNext, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\nThen, 3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be calculated as:\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with so many steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one correctly. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait a second, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). That looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be more confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the result is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes now. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation also gave me another way to verify the result, which is reassuring.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is given by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\). We compute each term step by step:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth term by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a series of multiplications and additions, each nested inside the previous one. So, it's like each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and this is done multiple times. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to rewrite this expression to see if I can spot a pattern or something. Let's denote each level as a step, starting from the innermost one.\n\nLet me number them as step 1, step 2, up to step 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis is part of the next level. So, maybe it's 8 steps? Hmm, maybe I should just start computing from the inside and work my way out.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost part: (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3 times that result plus 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + the next layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet's define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + Step 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Wait, maybe each step is inside another set of parentheses. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the innermost parentheses outward. Let's list each level:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first step. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of 3(...) layers.\n\nLet me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ... occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I have 3*(1 + ...), so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Then, 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in the original expression, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time you have 3*(1 + ...), and there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, perhaps the final result is 36084.\n\nBut let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the levels. Let me recount the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first innermost.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so let's count how many times 3*(1 + ... occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses:\n\nEach time you have a closing parenthesis, that's the end of a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first closing parenthesis is after (1 + 3), then each subsequent closing parenthesis is part of the next layer.\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses:\n\n1. After (1 + 3): 1\n\n2. Then, the next closing parenthesis is after (1 + 3(...)): 2\n\nContinuing, up to the 9th closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each layer is a 3*(1 + ...) and there are 8 such layers, because the first innermost is just (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try to write the expression with each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as a recursive expression.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but maybe f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then f(9) would be 36084.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, how many times does this happen? Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first step, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) \u2192 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) \u2192 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) \u2192 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) \u2192 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) \u2192 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) \u2192 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) \u2192 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) \u2192 36084\n\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(...) would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) \u2192 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) \u2192 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) \u2192 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) \u2192 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) \u2192 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) \u2192 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) \u2192 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) \u2192 36084\n\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) \u2192 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but in the original expression, does the outermost 3 multiply the entire expression? Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost 3 is multiplying the entire (1 + ...), which includes 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, and the outermost 3 is the 10th layer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each step carefully.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + Step 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + Step 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + Step 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + Step 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + Step 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + Step 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + Step 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + Step 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nNow, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Step 9. Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which would be Step 10.\n\nWait, no, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the first step is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3*(1 + ...), so how many 3*(1 + ... are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside, so it's 3*(...), where ... is (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of times 3*(1 + ... occurs is 9 times, because each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as n layers, where n is the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nWait, maybe it's 8 layers because after the innermost, each 3*(1 + ... is a layer.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should just compute each step carefully, regardless of the count, and see where it leads me.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(1 + Step 9). Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts a new layer. So, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nStarting from the first 3, each 3( starts a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3)\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), and then the outermost 3*(1 + ...) is the 10th layer.\n\nWait, but that would make the computation go up to Step 10, giving 108255.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. Next: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nEach time you see 3*(1 +, that's a new layer. So, in the original expression, after the initial 3*(1 +, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as n layers, where n is 9, so the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to step 9, I got 36084, but the original expression might have one more layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not correctly counting how many times the 3*(1 + ... is applied.\n\nLet me try to write the expression with each layer clearly:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(1 + L9). Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which would be 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nBut wait, that would make it 10 layers, but in the original expression, I only see 9 layers of 3*(1 + ... after the initial 3*(1 +.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3*, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and this repeats 8 times.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, so the final result is 12027.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 36084, and then the outermost layer would be 108255.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting because I'm including the initial 3* as a layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, so the result is 12027.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to compute it step by step, carefully.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer as per the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nEach time you see 3*(1 +, that's a new layer. So, in the original expression, starting from the first 3*(1 +, there are 9 such layers, because each subsequent 3*(1 + is nested inside the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because I'm including the initial 3* as a layer, but maybe the expression only has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ... after the initial 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 3*(1 + occurs after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(1 +, each subsequent 3*(1 + is nested inside. So, how many times does 3*(1 + occur after the initial 3*?\n\nLet me see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(1 +, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ... parts. So, total layers of 3*(1 + ... after the initial 3* is 8.\n\nTherefore, the computation would be:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the result is 36084. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) would be 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nEach closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis ends a layer.\n\nThe original expression has 9 closing parentheses after the initial 3*(1 +.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, there are 9 layers, each with a closing parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, the computation would be up to 9 layers, giving 36084, and then the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) is the 10th layer, giving 108255.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nEach time you see 3*(1 +, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1: 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2: 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3: 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4: 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5: 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6: 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7: 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8: 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + Layer 8) \u2192 Layer 9: 36084\n\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + Layer 9) \u2192 Layer 10: 108255\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts.\n\nEach 3*(1 + corresponds to a new layer. So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, each 3*(1 + is a layer. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, leading to the result 36084, and then the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) is the 10th layer, giving 108255.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, regardless of the count, to see what the final result is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 3 \u21d2 -2C = 3 \u21d2 C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 3/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 \u21d2 A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9, since the original expression seems to have 9 layers.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000\n\nSo, 216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 / 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, the result is 36,084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but according"

It seems like a nested expression where each level is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me see if I can count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by the previous result.\n\nLet me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Maybe that's the best approach because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nSo, let's define each level. Let me number them from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9, since I can see there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, which is the outermost.

So let's count how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's see, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

So that's the first inner layer.\n\nThen, inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), so that's the second inner layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have another 3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1 + 3(...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3: that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me try that.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe outermost expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first inner layer.\n\nThen, inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first occurrence.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...).

So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the first 3 is outside the first parenthesis. Then, inside that, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is the first inner layer. Each time we have another (1 + 3(...)), that's another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's a (, then inside, another (, and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is the first inner layer.\n\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second inner layer.\n\n- Continuing this way, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write down the expression with indices:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a ( after a 3, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe I can just count the number of times 3 is followed by a (.\n\nWait, in the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, we have a (, then inside that, another 3(, and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of times 3( occurs in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 occurrences of 3(, but that can't be right because the innermost is just 1 + 3, without another 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, that's the first occurrence.\n\nThen, inside that, we have another 3(, that's the second.\n\nContinuing this, each time we have a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, but in the innermost part, after the eighth 3(, we have 1 + 3, which doesn't have another 3(, so perhaps there are only 8 layers.\n\nWait, maybe that's the confusion. So, if there are 8 layers, then L1 to L8, and then the total expression is 3*(L8).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L9, which might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start over.\n\nLet me try to count the number of layers correctly.\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer outside adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...), and the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by a (.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting after the first 3, we have:\n\n- (1 + 3(...\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Inside that: ( another time\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can just count the number of opening parentheses in the entire expression.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because each layer adds another (.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the innermost is 1 + 3, without another (.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nLet me try to write the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote the innermost as L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9, which would be the outermost layer before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the number of layers is 9, and the final result is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, but when I calculated up to L9 earlier, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572, which seems very large. Maybe that's correct, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations step by step.\n\nStarting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me check if I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so let's count how many layers there are.\n\nFrom the innermost, 1 + 3: layer 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer1): layer2\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer2): layer3\n\nContinuing until layer9, which is the outermost before the final 3*(...).\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation up to layer9 is correct, resulting in 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems consistent. But maybe I can check a smaller version to see if the approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a smaller version of the problem with fewer layers to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, if the problem was 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that works. So, my method seems correct for a smaller version.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my calculation for the original problem is correct, resulting in 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another small example to be sure.\n\nSuppose the problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer can be represented as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. The formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, it's a series of 3 multiplied by a sum that itself contains another 3 multiplied by a sum, and this goes on multiple times. I think I need to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3), right? Then each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nLooking at the expression: starting from the left, each time after 1+3, there's another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(...\". Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6.

Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the entire expression is 3 times that. So perhaps there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression starting from the innermost as E1, E2, E3, etc., where each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1). So, starting from E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on, up to E8. Then the entire expression is 3*E8.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3, and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as a recursive expression. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, as I did before, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I had E1 = 1+3 = 4.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut let me check how many layers that is. Each Ei corresponds to a layer, starting from E1 as the innermost. So, if there are 8 layers, then E8 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, starting from the innermost, how many times do we have \"1+3(...)\"?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each \"1+3\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 1\n\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 2\n\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u21923\n\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u21924\n\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u21925\n\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u21926\n\n7.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u21928\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(...), which would be E8 as I calculated before.\n\nSo, 8 layers inside, then multiplied by 3, giving 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but maybe I should verify this with a different approach. Perhaps using the formula for a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1). So, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Ei = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by setting Ei - 3*E(i-1) = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1).\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies Ei^(h) = 3*E(i-1)^(h). So, the solution is Ei^(h) = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ei^(p) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ei = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When i=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo, E1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ei = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^(i+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ei = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, for i=8, E8 = (3^(9) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nThus, E8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 29,523.\n\nBut let me verify by computing each layer again step by step, just to be thorough.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it in another way, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, but each layer is Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^i.\n\nWait, considering the formula we derived earlier, Ei = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for i=8, E8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 19683 -1 = 19682, divided by 2 is 9841.\n\nThen, 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that each layer adds another 3^i term.\n\nWait, for example, E1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nE2 = 13 = 3^3 + 1^2? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1+3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext:\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nI think I'm confident in this result now. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, using the recurrence relation Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1). After computing each layer up to E8, the result is multiplied by 3, yielding the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

It seems like each layer has a similar structure, so maybe there's a pattern I can exploit here. Let me see if I can work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, let me replace that part first.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, let me write it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Wait, no, that's not quite right.

So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. I'll label each step as S1, S2, up to S9, since there are nine layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Let's call this S1 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out is 1 + 3*S1. So, S2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*S2. So, S3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7.

S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing S9, which is the outermost parentheses, we need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*S9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (S1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (S2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (S3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (S4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (S5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (S6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (S7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (S8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (S9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9, so 3*29524.

But maybe I should verify each step to be sure.\n\nLet me recompute each S step:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nS3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nS4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nS5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nS6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nS7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nS8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nS9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nOutermost:3*13=39.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 +3))) =3(1 +3(1 +3*4))=3(1 +3(1+12))=3(1+3*13)=3(1+39)=3*40=120.\n\nWait, that's different from 39. Wait, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, in this small example, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 +3))). So, innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, next layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen, next layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen, outermost:3*40=120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the result is 120, not 39. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but in my first test, I thought of 3(1 +3(1 +3(1+3))) as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(4))) which is 3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(40)=120.\n\nSo, in that case, the result is 120, which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, in the original problem, each layer is 1 +3*S(n-1), starting from S1=4, up to S9=29524, then multiplied by 3, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial test, the expression with three layers (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) gives 40 before the outermost 3, so 3*40=120.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving S(n) = 3*S(n-1), which has the solution S_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution S_p(n) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K =1 +3K \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition S(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, S(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with our earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: S(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S(2) = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, S(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this formula approach with the small example I had earlier.\n\nIn the small example, n=3 layers:\n\nS(3)= (3^{4} -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40. Then, 3*40=120, which matches the manual computation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then, moving outward, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, so let's try this approach:\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that seems to be growing very quickly. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the inner layer). So, perhaps the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), but that's not exactly right because the innermost is only 1 + 3. Let me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each innermost expression first and then building up each layer.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3 times the previous step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me try to define each step more carefully.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as step 1 to step 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Step 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, that's getting really big. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is that I'm not correctly interpreting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst, compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nWait, that's getting huge. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a pattern where each step is 3*(1 + 3*(previous step)). So, if I define f(n) as the value at step n, then f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)).\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 3*f(1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 3*f(2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so after nine layers, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because each step is getting multiplied by 3 and adding 3 each time, which leads to exponential growth, so maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly counted the number of layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe there are nine layers. So, f(9) would be the final result.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39 (layer 2)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354 (layer 3)\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189 (layer 4)\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28,704 (layer 5)\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 258,339 (layer 6)\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 2,325,054 (layer 7)\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 20,925,489 (layer 8)\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 188,329,404 (layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, after nine layers, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a very large number, and maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me check a couple of the steps again.\n\nStarting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, it seems the calculations are correct. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 3 times the previous result, which leads to exponential growth, so the final result is indeed 188,329,404.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nThe recursive formula is f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)).\n\nLet me write that as f(n) = 3 + 9*f(n-1).\n\nSo, f(n) = 9*f(n-1) + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 9*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*9^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 9*A + 3.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 9*A = 3 => -8*A = 3 => A = -3/8.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, f(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 => 4 = 9C - 3/8.\n\nAdding 3/8 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/8 = 9C => 35/8 = 9C => C = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72).\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSimplifying, since 9^n is 9 raised to n, and 35/72 is a constant.\n\nLet me compute f(9) using this formula to see if it matches the step-by-step result.\n\nf(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9. Let's see:\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nNow, (35/72)*387,420,489 = (35 * 387,420,489) / 72.\n\nLet me compute 35 * 387,420,489.\n\nFirst, 35 * 387,420,489:\n\nCompute 30*387,420,489 = 11,622,614,670\n\nCompute 5*387,420,489 = 1,937,102,445\n\nAdd them together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115.\n\nNow, divide that by 72:\n\n13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n72 * 188,329,404 = ?\n\nWait, 72 * 188,329,404 = 72 * 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72.\n\nWell, 72 * 188,329,404 = 13,559,717,168, which is slightly higher than 13,559,717,115, so perhaps there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier.\n\nWait, 35 * 387,420,489:\n\nLet me compute 35 * 387,420,489 step by step.\n\nCompute 387,420,489 * 35:\n\nBreak it down as 387,420,489 * 30 + 387,420,489 * 5.\n\n387,420,489 * 30:\n\n387,420,489 * 10 = 3,874,204,890.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3,874,204,890 * 3 = 11,622,614,670.\n\n387,420,489 * 5:\n\nHalf of 387,420,489 is 193,710,244.5, so 193,710,244.5 * 10 = 1,937,102,445.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 * 35 = 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115.\n\nNow, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72.\n\nLet me compute how many times 72 fits into 13,559,717,115.\n\nCompute 72 * 188,329,404:\n\n72 * 188,329,404 = ?\n\nCompute 70 * 188,329,404 = 13,183,058,280.\n\nCompute 2 * 188,329,404 = 376,658,808.\n\nAdd them together: 13,183,058,280 + 376,658,808 = 13,559,717,088.\n\nSo, 72 * 188,329,404 = 13,559,717,088.\n\nSubtract this from 13,559,717,115: 13,559,717,115 - 13,559,717,088 = 27.\n\nSo, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72 = 188,329,404 with a remainder of 27, which is 188,329,404 + 27/72 = 188,329,404 + 3/8.\n\nSo, (35/72)*9^9 = 188,329,404 + 3/8.\n\nNow, the closed-form solution is f(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 = 188,329,404 + 3/8 - 3/8 = 188,329,404.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step calculation. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from layer 1:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where each layer is 3^n times something. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the closed-form solution, f(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nWhich can also be written as f(n) = (35/8)* (9^n)/9 - 3/8 = (35/8)*(9^{n-1}) - 3/8.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. The key point is that we've computed the result step by step and confirmed it with a closed-form formula, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\nSo, after all that, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{188329404}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 3 \\times 13 = 39\\).\n3.

It seems like each level adds another 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write it down step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3( previous result ). Let me check.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nSo, Level 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123.

So, starting from Level 1 to Level 9, as I did before.\n\nSo, Level 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Level 9) = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nC*3^n + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(C*3^{n-1}) = C*3^n\n\n3*D = 3D\n\nSo, right side becomes C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nLeft side is C*3^n + D\n\nTherefore, equate both sides:\n\nC*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each level n, a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, yes, this formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, 3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for Level 9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing one more level manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, Level 4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which is correct as per my earlier step-by-step.\n\nSimilarly, Level 5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total is a geometric progression.\n\nBut since each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplier and an additive constant, the closed-form expression I found earlier is probably the most straightforward way to compute it without having to expand each level manually.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, it's a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together, each inside another set of parentheses. I think I need to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's start from the inside.\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute (1 + 3)\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next step would be 3*(result from step 1).\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(4)\n3*4 = 12\n\nThen, we add 1 to that result. So, step 3 would be 1 + (result from step 2).\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm tracking the parentheses correctly. Each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time after computing the innermost, we multiply by 3 and then add 1, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each level is 3*(1 + something). So, maybe I should think of each step as computing 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I can model this as a recursive process.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to structure this more clearly. Since there are nine layers of parentheses, I can label each step from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s and 1s. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's (1 + 3), then each time we go out, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try writing each step down:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(result from step 9) = 3*36084 = 108252\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + 3(...)) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, wait, hold on, that's 10 steps. But in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking back: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 1, then each 1 + 3 has another set. So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of 3s before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer outwards is 3*(1 + ...). So, if we have 9 layers, then we have 9 multiplications by 3. So, in that case, my initial calculation went up to 10 steps, but perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try to write each step clearly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 3*(1 + previous term). Starting from the innermost term, which is 4.\n\nSo:\n\nTerm 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nTerm 2: 3*(1 + Term1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nTerm 3: 3*(1 + Term2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nTerm 4: 3*(1 + Term3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nTerm 5: 3*(1 + Term4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nTerm 6: 3*(1 + Term5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nTerm 7: 3*(1 + Term6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nTerm 8: 3*(1 + Term7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nTerm 9: 3*(1 + Term8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nTerm 10: 3*(1 + Term9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many layers? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of 3s before the innermost 1+3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another layer. So, starting from the first 3, each 3(1 + 3(...) adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? From the innermost (1 + 3) up to the 9th layer being 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nBut then, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so after the 9th layer, we have another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, perhaps that's the 10th step.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) happen? Let's count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3s is 9, meaning there are 9 layers. So, after 9 layers, the outermost 3*(1 + ...) would be the 10th step. So, perhaps my initial calculation of 10 steps is correct, leading to 108255.\n\nBut I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nWait, each step is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\na_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nSo, if I have 10 terms, then the final result is 108,255.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to make sure how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of 3s before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), so that's the base case, a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have nine layers after the innermost, that would be a_10. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...). So, the first layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is a_2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, which is a_3.\n\nContinuing this way, up to the outermost layer, which would be a_10.\n\nSo, yes, the final result would be a_10 = 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing each step again:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. a_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 108,255.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, perhaps using a formula for the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2, so 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\n11/2 = 3*A\n\nThus, A = (11/2) / 3 = 11/(6)\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, so:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute a_n directly using the formula.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nLet me compute a_10 using this formula.\n\na_10 = (11/6)*3^{10} - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^10 = 59049\n\nThen,\n\na_10 = (11/6)*59049 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*59049:\n\nFirst, compute 59049 \u00f7 6:\n\n59049 \u00f7 6 = 9841.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11:\n\n9841.5 * 11\n\nLet me compute 9841.5 * 10 = 98,415\n\nPlus 9841.5 = 98,415 + 9,841.5 = 108,256.5\n\nSo, (11/6)*59049 = 108,256.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n108,256.5 - 1.5 = 108,255\n\nSo, a_10 = 108,255, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 108,255.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, even though the expression looked complicated with all those nested parentheses, by breaking it down step by step and recognizing the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more step manually to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFrom a_9 = 36,084\n\nThen, a_10 = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*(36,085) = 108,255\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 108,255.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{108255}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence where each term is computed as \\( a_n = 3 \\times (1 + a_{n-1}) \\), starting from the innermost term.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Each time there's a 1+3(...), so let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nLet me try to count the number of 3(1+3(...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So the outermost is 3 times the 9th layer. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). So perhaps there are 8 layers inside the first 3(...). Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards step by step. Let me assign variables to each layer to make it manageable.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3 * E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3 * E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3 * E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3 * E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3 * E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 * E8\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times E9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(E9). So the total expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, then multiply the final result by 3, that should give me the answer.\n\nLet me compute each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3 * E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3 * E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3 * E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3 * E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3 * E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 * E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 * E9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * E9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the number is 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, that seems like a very large number. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9.\n\nWait, E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and E8 was 9841. So 3*9841 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. That's correct.\n\nThen 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have a nested expression, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times '1+3(' occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the 9th layer. So that would be E9 as I defined before. So perhaps my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me see, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each step, because it's tedious and error-prone.\n\nLooking at each E_i, I notice that each E_i = 1 + 3*E_{i-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. So perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, E1 is 4, as I computed before.\n\nWait, but let me check: If E1 is 1 + 3, that's 4.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, so each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^{n} * E_0 + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1), where E_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, E1 is 4, so maybe E_0 would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to index starting from E1.\n\nLet me think: the recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nSo, to solve E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3*29524 was 88,572, which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. Since E9 corresponds to 9 layers, and the original expression is 3*(E9), that would be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n4. 1+3(...)\n5. 1+3(...)\n6. 1+3(...)\n7. 1+3(...)\n8. 1+3(...)\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, 9 layers, each adding another 3(...). Therefore, E9 is the outermost expression before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*E9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSince each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 =4.\n\nBut as I found earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute this using another approach, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nE3 =1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nE4=1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nE5=1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, total=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again, 29524*3.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to compute this: using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nBecause each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but in this case, each E_n is defined as E_n = 1 +3*E_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, but perhaps we can express the total expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), each time I'm adding another 3*(...).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but maybe using the formula I found earlier is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, considering that each time we're multiplying by 3, perhaps the total expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that approach would help more than the step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which isn't a simple geometric series. It's more like a geometric progression with a constant term added each time.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach I took earlier using the recurrence relation is the most straightforward.\n\nSo, given that, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute E9 again using the formula.\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked this enough times, and each time I get the same result. So I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards.

It seems like each layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's see. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\n2. 3 * (result from step 1) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So maybe I should structure it as such. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost. There are 9 layers, I think, because each time it's 1 + 3(...), and it's repeated multiple times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the outermost 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times something.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Compute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.\n\nSo 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523.\n\nThen 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost operation: 3 * 29524.\n\nCompute 3 * 29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*(20000) = 60000\n\n3*(9000) = 27000\n\n3*(500) = 1500\n\n3*(20) = 60\n\n3*(4) = 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a very large number. Maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \n2. The next 3( adds another layer.\n...\nHow many times does \"3(\" occur after the initial 3?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is the outermost, then inside it, there's another 3(, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3(, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was the innermost, and then the outermost operation was 3*(Layer 9). So that would make sense.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, Layer 9 was 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which gave 29524, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9) gave 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, and the outermost 3*(...) as Layer 9? No, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of times you apply the operation 1 + 3*(...). Each time, you're adding another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then one more multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as per earlier calculation.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I think I might have confused the number of layers earlier. So, in the problem, how many times does the operation 1 + 3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the first 3(, how many times does that happen?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost.\n\nThen inside it, another 3(, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of 3( after the initial 3 is 8, making it 9 layers in total, including the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers, starting from a_1 as the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that in the problem, the number of layers is 9, so a_9 is 29524, and then the outermost 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it all, the expression would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich, when expanded, would give a sum of terms with 3 raised to various powers.\n\nWait, maybe I can write it as:\n\n3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + 3*3^3 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each time you expand, you get 3 multiplied by 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, it's more like a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the total sum is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but I think the approach using the recurrence relation is more straightforward and accurate.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that using both methods (step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula) give the same result, I think the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. After computing up to the 9th layer, we get 29524.\n\n4. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like there are multiple layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times another expression. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, it's like a chain where each link depends on the one before it. Let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. The next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So that's (1 + 3*4). Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n3. Next, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So that's (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n4. Then, (1 + 3*(result from step 3)) = (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*40 is indeed 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)) = (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nWait, 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so yes, 363 + 1 is 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)) = (1 + 3*364). Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Moving out another layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)) = (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is indeed 3280. Okay, that seems right.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)) = (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWait, 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Moving out another layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)) = (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct.\n\n10. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 9)) = (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Now, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 10)) = (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding them: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. Correct.\n\n12. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 11) = 3*265720. Let's compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, adding them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nWait, but let me compute 265720 * 3 another way. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, adding them: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 times (the result from step 11). So, yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 797160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with all these large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\n12. 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I think the final answer is 797,160.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Sometimes, with these nested expressions, there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. Each subsequent layer is built by this recursion.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found, and perhaps that can help me compute the result without having to calculate each step manually. Let me try to derive the formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Good, so the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, how many layers do we have in the original problem? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\", it seems there are 9 layers, right? Because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. So, if I have 9 layers, then n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to step 12, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is one layer. Then each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3(...)\n3. 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 times? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the outermost is just multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(...)\", each adding a layer. So, n=9.\n\nUsing the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, when I reached step 9, the result was 29524, which matches a_9. Then, moving outwards, each step corresponds to the next layer. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 797,160. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(layer1)), which is layer 2.\n- Then, layer3, layer4, etc., until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(\" after the first is adding a layer, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how I count the layers. Let me try a different approach. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 2.\n3. Continuing, layer3, layer4, layer5, layer6, layer7, layer8, layer9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nThus, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 797,160, which is much larger. That suggests I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is more than 9. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" after the first is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer1.\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, so:\n\n- Layer1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer2: (1 + 3(layer1))\n- Layer3: (1 + 3(layer2))\n- Layer4: (1 + 3(layer3))\n- Layer5: (1 + 3(layer4))\n- Layer6: (1 + 3(layer5))\n- Layer7: (1 + 3(layer6))\n- Layer8: (1 + 3(layer7))\n- Layer9: (1 + 3(layer8))\n- Layer10: (1 + 3(layer9))\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers. So, n=10.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous count. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer10), where layer10 = 1 + 3*layer9\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*layer8\n\n...\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3*(1) = 4? Wait, no, layer1 is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nlayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nlayer8: 1 + 3*layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nlayer9: 1 + 3*layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nlayer10: 1 + 3*layer9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*layer10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial step-by-step, where I went up to 797,160. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I went up to 12 steps, but perhaps that was incorrect. Let me recount with the formula.\n\nIf the number of layers is 10, then a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147, so a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. layer1:4\n\n2. layer2:13\n\n3. layer3:40\n\n4. layer4:121\n\n5. layer5:364\n\n6. layer6:1093\n\n7. layer7:3280\n\n8. layer8:9841\n\n9. layer9:29524\n\n10. layer10:88573\n\n11. Then, 3*layer10:265719\n\nWait, so the total expression is 265,719.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, computing up to 797,160, which must have been a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is one layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer after the innermost is (1 + 3(...)), so that's layer2.\n\n- Then, another \"1 + 3(\", layer3.\n\nContinuing, up to layer9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer9), where layer9 = 1 + 3*layer8\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*layer7\n\n...\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3*(1) = 4\n\nWait, so layer1 is (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*layer1 = 13\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*layer2 = 40\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*layer3 = 121\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*layer4 = 364\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*layer5 = 1093\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*layer6 = 3280\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*layer7 = 9841\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*layer8 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier count. I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would make the formula a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 12 steps, which led me to 797,160, which seems way too high. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the expression with the layers clearly:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nlayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer2: (1 + 3*layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nlayer3: (1 + 3*layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nlayer4: (1 + 3*layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nlayer5: (1 + 3*layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nlayer6: (1 + 3*layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nlayer7: (1 + 3*layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nlayer8: (1 + 3*layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nlayer9: (1 + 3*layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with the formula approach where n=9, giving a_9=29524, and total expression=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there were 10 layers, leading to 3*88573=265719, which seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in whether the initial (1 + 3) is layer1 or layer0.\n\nWait, in the formula approach, I considered a_1 = (1 + 3) =4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9=29524, so total is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I went up to 12 steps, which must have been incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can verify this with a smaller example.\n\nLet me take a smaller version of the problem, say:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nAccording to the formula, this should be 3*(a_3), where a_3=1 + 3*a_2, a_2=1 + 3*a_1, a_1=1 + 3=4.\n\nSo, a_2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na_3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen, total expression=3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step-by-step:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)=4\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*4)=13\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13)=40\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120.\n\nWhich matches the formula approach. So, in this case, there are 3 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so n=3, a_3=40, total=120.\n\nSimilarly, if I take another small example:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nHere, innermost: (1 + 3)=4\n\nNext: (1 + 3*4)=13\n\nNext: (1 + 3*13)=40\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40)=121\n\nOutermost: 3*121=363.\n\nAccording to the formula, n=4, a_4= (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, so total expression=3*121=363.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the number of layers inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9, because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, up to 9 layers.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 12 steps, leading to 797,160, which is much larger. That suggests I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original problem. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3*(.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3*(.\n\n1. The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3*( is layer1: (1 + 3(...))\n\n2. Then, another \"1 + 3(\" inside that is layer2.\n\nContinuing, up to layer9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step must have had an error in counting the layers, leading to an incorrect final answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 4\n\n2.13\n\n3.40\n\n4.121\n\n5.364\n\n6.1093\n\n7.3280\n\n8.9841\n\n9.29524\n\n10.88573\n\n11.265719\n\n12.797,160\n\nBut according to the formula, after 9 layers, we have 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong in the step-by-step? It seems I continued past the 9th layer"

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside another set of parentheses. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, when I simplified the innermost (1 + 3), the next level out would be 3 times that result, right? Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nActually, each level is 3 times (1 + something). So perhaps I should work from the inside out, simplifying each layer one by one.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression has 9 layers of nesting, right? Let me check how many times 3 is multiplied. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer wraps another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), and inside each, another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many 3*(1 + ... layers there are.\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then 3*(1 + that)\n3. Then another 3*(1 + that)\n4.

(1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3*(1 + Layer1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 3*(1 + Layer2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 3*(1 + Layer3) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 3*(1 + Layer4) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 3*(1 + Layer5) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 3*(1 + Layer6) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 3*(1 + Layer7) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 3*(1 + Layer8) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9 as 36084. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 first 3 after the initial 3\n2. Then another 3*(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's the second.\n\nContinuing this way, how many opening parentheses are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n\nThen inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), so that's two layers, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is not multiplied by 3. So perhaps the number of layers where 3 is multiplied is one less than the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after the initial 3 is one.\n- Then inside that, another (, so two.\n- Continuing, up to the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 followed by 9 opening parentheses. So, perhaps there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). But each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out is 3*(1 + previous layer). So maybe I need to compute 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to 9 layers, but maybe I made a mistake in the computation steps. Let me try again, more carefully, step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, because Layer9 is the innermost, and each layer out is multiplied by 3. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, no, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the outermost is 3*(1 + Layer1), where Layer1 is the innermost (1 + 3). So maybe I should have 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), with the innermost being Layer1: (1 + 3).\n\nWait, let's try that approach. Let me try to count the layers correctly.\n\nIf the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...). Because each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Each time, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4) \u2192 15\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) \u2192 48\n\nAnd so on, until we have 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), with 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, that would mean that the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, 8 times.\n\nWait, so maybe I should compute 8 layers, not 9.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nSo, Layer8 would be 12027, and then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*12027 = 36081.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 36084, but that might have been because I considered 9 layers. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1: 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n3*(1 + Layer1) \u2192 Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, 3*(1 + Layer2) \u2192 Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen, 3*(1 + Layer3) \u2192 Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n3*(1 + Layer4) \u2192 Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n3*(1 + Layer5) \u2192 Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n3*(1 + Layer6) \u2192 Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n3*(1 + Layer7) \u2192 Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n3*(1 + Layer8) \u2192 Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), right? Because each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 adds another layer.\n\nWait, no, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first 3 is outside, and then each subsequent 3 is inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each step out multiplies by 3 and adds 1, and there are 8 such steps, leading to the final result being 3*(...). Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me represent each layer as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, f(1) would be the innermost layer, which is 4. Then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, as before.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but then the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be f(9). But that seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step without assigning f(n).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out, each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo:\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which, if we have 9 layers, would be 36084. But when I count the number of 3*(1 + ...), it's 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 instances of 3*(1 + ...). So, that would mean 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nTherefore, the number of layers where we compute 3*(1 + ...) is 8, with the innermost being (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, let's compute 8 layers:\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is 8 layers deep.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + 3)]))]))]))])\n\nSo, each [ ] represents a nested expression. Let's count how many times 3*(1 + ...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1: 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + Layer1) \u2192 Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + Layer2) \u2192 Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + Layer3) \u2192 Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + Layer4) \u2192 Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + Layer5) \u2192 Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + Layer6) \u2192 Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + Layer7) \u2192 Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + Layer8) \u2192 Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, but that would mean we have another layer outside of Layer9. But in the original expression, after the initial 3, there's only 8 layers of 3*(...). So perhaps Layer9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 instances of 3*(1 + ...). So, that would mean 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, each layer out is 3*(1 + previous result), and there are 8 such layers.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nSo, after 8 layers, we reach 12027. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the original expression is 3*(Layer8 + 1), where Layer8 is 12027, so 3*(12027 + 1) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I thought that Layer9 would be 36084, but perhaps that's not the case because the original expression only has 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, as it's time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + a*(a + a*(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the result after n layers, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nLet me write the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\n3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2\n\nSo,\n\nL_n = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = [11*3^{n-1} - 3] / 2\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nIf the original expression has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), then n = 8.\n\nSo, L_8 = (11*3^{8-1} - 3)/2 = (11*3^7 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^7:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\nSo,\n\nL_8 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027\n\nWait, that's the value we got earlier for Layer8. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + L_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, L_8 is 12027, which is the result after 8 layers. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + L_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but according to the formula I derived, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. So, for n=8, it's 12027, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + L_8), which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, if I were to compute L_9, that would be (11*3^{9-1} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nSo, L_9 = 36084, which is exactly the result we get when we compute 3*(1 + L_8).\n\nWait, so perhaps the original expression is equivalent to L_9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but according to the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside, so that would be L_9 = 36084.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the original expression as having 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), including the initial 3, then it would be L_9 = 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps I was miscounting the layers earlier. Let me try to recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1.\n\n- Then, moving out, each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer.\n\nSo, the expression has 9 layers: 1 innermost, and 8 more layers out.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 9 layers in total, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer1, then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, meaning L_9 = 36084.\n\nBut according to the formula, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, L_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the original expression is equivalent to L_9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the original expression had 8 layers after the initial 3, but according to the formula, L_9 is 36084, which would mean that the original expression is indeed 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. But according to the formula, L_n represents the result after n layers, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer1.\n\nTherefore, the original expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside, would be L_9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), so it's 3*(1 + L_8), which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084, which is L_9.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I computed step by step earlier, I got to Layer9 as 36084, which matches the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with the step-by-step computation:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9,\n\nL_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: $(1 + 3) = 4$\n2. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15$\n3. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48$\n4. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147$\n5. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444$\n6. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335$\n7. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008$\n8. Next layer: $3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027$\n9. Outermost layer: $3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084$\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Each level seems to have 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, right? Then each layer wraps around that. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n3. Then another layer: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n4. And this continues, so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1 + 3(...)): Let's see, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So from the first 3, there are 8 more layers, right? Because I can see 8 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, maybe not. Let me count:\n\nStarting after the first 3, each subsequent layer is (1 + 3(...)). So the first innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So let me think:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, perhaps? Because the expression seems to have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is enclosed in another 1+3(...) until we have 9 such layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's 8 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(something), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*(result of 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result of 2)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(result of 3)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(result of 4)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(result of 5)\n7.

Let me check the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 has a corresponding closing one. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- 3(\n  1+3(\n    1+3(\n      1+3(\n        1+3(\n          1+3(\n            1+3(\n              1+3(\n                1+3(\n                  1+3\n                )\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n)\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...) sections:\n\n1. The first is 1+3\n2. Then another 1+3 inside that\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (L1)\n2. Then next layer: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (L2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (L3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (L4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (L5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (L6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (L7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (L8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (L9)\n\nThen the outermost 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to ensure I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more (1+3(...) sections. So perhaps I have 8 layers inside the first 3, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, that would mean L1 to L9, but perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n11. )... etc.\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, each introducing a new layer. So perhaps there are 8 layers inside the first 3, meaning that L1 to L8, and then the outermost 3*(L8). Let me try that approach.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is 4.\n\nThen moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time, we have a new (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 8 more layers, each with their own (1+3(...)). So that would make 8 layers inside the first 3, meaning that the outermost expression is 3*(L8), where L8 is the result after 8 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, with 8 layers, I got 3*9841 = 29523. But when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears inside the first 3. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of \"1+3(\" is 8, because each time after that, it's another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but let me think in terms of the structure:\n\nEach time you have a (1+3(...)), so each time you enter a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time you go up a layer, you have another 1+3*(previous result).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my earlier count. So perhaps the correct answer is 29523.\n\nBut let me confirm by writing out each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one, ensuring I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841:\n\nLet's compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 88,572, which is much larger. So which is correct?\n\nI think I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me see the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 8 layers inside the first 3, meaning that the outermost 3 is multiplied by the 8th layer. So my calculation of 29,523 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 8, that was the 8th layer, so 3*(Layer 8) = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThen, the sequence would be:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the expression again to ensure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 8 instances of \"1+3(\", each introducing a new layer.\n\nTherefore, we have 8 layers inside the first 3, so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the 8th layer, which is 9841, giving 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 29,523.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one more layer to see.\n\nWait, if I have 8 layers, then the outermost is 3*(a8) = 29,523.\n\nAlternatively, if I have 9 layers, it would be 3*(a9) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572, but that seems too large.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute a9 and see if it's correct.\n\nWait, a9 would be 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut in the expression, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) sections:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then each time it's 1+3*(...), so each layer adds one more.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, after the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 8, which means 8 layers inside, making the outermost 3*(a8).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can approach this by expanding the expression step by step.\n\nLet me try to write the expression in a more expanded form.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as A:\n\nA = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is:\n\nB = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nC = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext:\n\nD = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext:\n\nE = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext:\n\nF = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\nG = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\nH = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is:\n\n3*H = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 29,523.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I miscounted the number of layers, but by carefully expanding each step, it becomes clear that the result is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_8 \\) where each level is computed as \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous level)} \\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost level:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Compute the next level:\n   \\[ L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\]\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_8 = 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[ \\boxed{29523} \\]"

It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to simplify it from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the very inside, I see the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that, the next layer out is 3(1 + 3(...)), but let me see exactly where that innermost part is. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So starting from the innermost, let me work my way out.\n\nLet me list out each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as each step being 3*(1 + previous step). Let me try that.\n\nWait, let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). Wait, no, maybe each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Let me try to parse the structure correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step, replacing each innermost expression with its value.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine layers of 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so maybe each step is 1 + 3*(next step). Let me try to compute each step one by one.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the innermost is S1, and each subsequent layer is built upon that. Let me see.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Let me assign that to S1.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(S1). So that would be:\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + next step). Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step is 3*(1 + previous step). So perhaps S1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen S2 is 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but let me check that. So if I have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe that's the right approach. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nS1: Innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nS2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3: 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4: 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5: 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6: 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7: 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8: 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9: 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the final result would be 36084? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so S9 would be the entire expression. So the answer should be 36084.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers. Wait, no, actually, each time we have another 3*(1 + ...), so let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me see.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + something). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). I think there are 9 layers here, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as the first step, then each 3*(1 + ...) as the next step.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I started with S1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then S2 as 3*(1 + S1), and so on up to S9, which would be the outermost 3*(1 + S8). So that would make 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So that would result in S9 = 36084.\n\nBut let me verify that again because it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3's after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we have a 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So the number of layers is 9, as each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to S9, I got 36084. Let me check that again step by step.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nLet me compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3*C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*C\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2, so 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3*C\n\nThus, C = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo the solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = 19683*10 + 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216504 / 6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6*36084 = 216504\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check one more time by computing each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{36084}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3. So, maybe it's a repeating pattern? Let me see.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me count how many layers there are here. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), and that happens multiple times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1. Hmm, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1+3*(previous result))\n3. And this continues until the outermost.\n\nWait, so maybe each layer is adding another 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, because I think there are 9 layers here. Let me check the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time it's wrapped in another (1 + 3*(...)), and this happens 8 more times, making it 9 layers in total. So, we have 9 layers, each time building on the previous one.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down each layer and compute its value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is the innermost part of the original expression? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is built from the previous one.\n\nSo, as I computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times the (1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, wrapping it: (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Each time, another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost, we have 8 more layers, making it 9 layers in total, right? Because the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check my calculations again because 29524 seems quite large.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 8.\n\nWait, that gives 88572, same as before.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 9 layers of 1 + 3*... seems like it's growing exponentially, and 88572 seems quite large, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions.\n\nLet me think about the general form. Suppose I have an expression like this: a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. Maybe there's a formula for this.\n\nIn this case, a=1, b=3, and n=9 layers.\n\nWait, so perhaps the value after n layers can be expressed as (b^{n+1} - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, no, that's the formula for a geometric series, but this is a bit different because each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, let me think recursively.\n\nLet\u2019s denote S(n) as the value after n layers. So,\n\nS(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1) for n > 1\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is S(n) = A*b^n + C, where b is the coefficient and C is a constant.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1.\n\nWait, that's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution S_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition S(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, S(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, S(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the innermost part, after 9 layers, is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is built upon the previous one, so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut since each term is added 1, it's a bit different, but as we saw, the formula S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works.\n\nSo, for n=9, S(9)=29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me just check with n=1,2,3 to see if the formula works.\n\nFor n=1, S(1)=4. Formula: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S(2)=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S(3)=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: S(4)=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: S(5)=364. Formula: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: S(6)=1093. Formula: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: S(7)=3280. Formula: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: S(8)=9841. Formula: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: S(9)=29524. Formula: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer, which gives me more confidence that S(9)=29524 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

It seems like each time there's a 3 multiplied by something that starts with 1 plus another expression. So it's like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then that result is used in the next one: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. And this repeats, each time adding another layer.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nI think there are 9 sets of parentheses here because I see 9 opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Let me check:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the inside, there are 9 layers. So, 9 layers mean 9 steps. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\n**Step 2: Move to the next layer out**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)\n\nWe just found that the innermost is 4, so plug that in:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\n**Step 3: Next layer out**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)\n\nFrom Step 2, we have 13, so:\n\n1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, this layer is 40.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So yes, each step is 1 plus three times the previous result. So far, so good.\n\n**Step 4: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3)\n\nStep 3 gave us 40, so:\n\n1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, this layer is 121.\n\n**Step 5: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4)\n\nStep 4 was 121, so:\n\n1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 364? Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3; so 300+60+3=363. Then 363 +1=364. Yep, correct.\n\n**Step 6: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5)\n\nStep 5 was 364, so:\n\n1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's do 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, this layer is 1093.\n\n**Step 7: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6)\n\nStep 6 gave us 1093, so:\n\n1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down:\n\n1000*3=3000\n\n90*3=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, that seems high, but let's check:\n\n3*1093: 1093*3. Let me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Yeah, that's correct.\n\n**Step 8: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7)\n\nStep 7 was 3280, so:\n\n1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000\n\n200*3=600\n\n80*3=240\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, this layer is 9841.\n\n**Step 9: Next layer**\n\nExpression: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8)\n\nStep 8 gave us 9841, so:\n\n1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so this layer is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that multiplication again because 9841*3 is 29523, right?\n\nYes, because 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those gives 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524.\n\nOkay, so that's correct.\n\nNow, after Step 9, we've reached the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses simplifies to 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result, right? Because the original problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the innermost parentheses have been evaluated step by step.\n\nSo, after evaluating all the inner parentheses, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Therefore, the final step is to multiply this by 3.\n\n**Final Step: Multiply by 3**\n\nCompute 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me write 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, maybe a better way is:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\nBut perhaps breaking it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nCompute units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\nHundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\nThousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\nTen-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524\n\nLet's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 4+4=8\n\nTens: 2+2=4\n\nHundreds:5+5=10, write 0, carry 1\n\nThousands:9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1\n\nTen-thousands:2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524\n\nAdding units: 8+4=12, write 2, carry 1\n\nTens:4+2=6 +1=7\n\nHundreds:0+5=5\n\nThousands:9+9=18, write 8, carry 1\n\nTen-thousands:5+2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire original expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of steps or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4=13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13=40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121=364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, hold on, that's 10 steps, but I thought there were 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is 3( ... ), and inside, it's 1 + 3( ... ), and each time another 3( ... ). So, how many times does 3( ... ) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3( inside the expression:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3( after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3( before the innermost (1+3). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait, the entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first layer: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nThen inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, so that's 9 times \"3(\", meaning 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers to compute, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then finally multiplying the outermost result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 9 layers of computation, leading up to 29524, and then the final multiplication by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut when I listed the steps, I had 10 steps because I included the final multiplication. So, perhaps that's why it's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, the structure is:\n\n3 * [1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))]\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(...), and finally, the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), starting from 1+3=4, and then each step up to 9 layers, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 steps inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), leading up to 29524, and then the final step was multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, that would mean that the 9 layers inside result in 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations again because the numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the 7th step again because 3*1093 is 3279, right?\n\nYes, because 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280.\n\nThen, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: as computed earlier, 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make this easier. It looks like each step is following a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEach step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation, where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich again gives the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through all the layers, but it's good that both methods agree.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each layer seems to have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by writing down the expression and seeing how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(...\". It seems like each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. But when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times (another expression)). Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of \"1+3\" before each closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way, each step adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Hmm, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. Then: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. Continuing: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. Then: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n7. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n8. Then: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1+3*(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total. So, I can compute starting from the innermost and work my way out.\n\nLet me try that. Let me define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u219288500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u219288560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStarting from L1 to L9:\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the start of L1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...) sections.\n\nFrom the original expression, after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLet me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1+3(...)), which is 9 times.\n\nWait, so does that mean there are 9 layers? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, L1: innermost 1+3\n\nL2: next layer 1+3*(L1)\n\n...\n\nL9: outermost 1+3*(L8), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, leading to L9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L1=4.\n\nSo, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution is L(n) = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems solid.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the formula works for the earlier layers.\n\nFor example, n=1: L(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the computation is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or computations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step using the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. This leads to the general solution L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives L(9) = 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think it's a nested multiplication problem where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several layers here. Let me count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. So maybe I should start from the inside and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each expression is inside another one.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n\nSo, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n\n1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n\n1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n\n1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n\n1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n\n1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n\n1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9)\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because 3*29524 might be easier if I break it down differently. Maybe 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524.\n\n3*29000 is 87000. 3*524: 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72, so 1500 + 72 is 1572. Then 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me count the steps again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(... so that's the first layer.\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers after the initial 3. But in the problem, it's written as 3(1+3(... nine times? Or is it that each time it's 1+3(...), so maybe there are nine layers inside. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 around it. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me see: Each time, it's 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous), and then the final result is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers, each step as I did before.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 10 steps, including the final multiplication by 3. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them differently. Let me try to write each step as S1, S2, up to S9, and then the final step S10.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to see each layer as S1 through S9, and then the outermost 3*(S9).\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final step is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps, let me verify each calculation again.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000\n\nBut 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000.\n\nSo 476 * 3 = 1,428\n\nSo 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, because sometimes it's easy to miscount how many layers there are. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as in the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( starts the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, how many ( are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3)\n...\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me see: Each time, it's 1+3(...), so each layer adds one more 1+3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside, and then one more multiplication by 3. So, total steps would be 9 layers and then one more step.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had S1 through S9, each being the result of 1+3*(previous), and then the final step was 3*S9. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each step manually.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(previous value). So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define S_n as the value after n layers. Then, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, S_{n} = 1 + 3*S_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume S_n^p = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: S_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\nS_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nS_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nS_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nS_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nS_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nS_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nS_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nS_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nS_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, S_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final step is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the value is 1 + 3 times the previous value. So, expanding this, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which forms a geometric series.\n\nBut since it's finite (9 layers), perhaps it's better to model it as a finite geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a linear recurrence, so the formula I derived earlier seems more appropriate.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the formula give me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so I think there are 9 layers in total because the problem starts with 3(...) and each subsequent 3(...) adds another layer. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the right, each time it's 1+3, then multiplied by 3, then added to 1, then multiplied by 3, etc. Let me try to parse it.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer9)\nLayer 11: 1 + Layer10\nLayer 12: 3*(Layer11)\n\nWait, but the original problem only has 9 layers of parentheses. Let me count the opening parentheses.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time it's followed by (1+3(...)). So how many times does 3(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"3(...)\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another 3( inside that,\n3. And so on until the last one is 3(1+3)\n\nSo let me count: from the first 3, each subsequent 3(...) is one more layer. So starting with the first 3(...), then each time another 3(...). So how many 3(...) are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first 3( is the outermost, then inside that is another 3(, and so on until the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, there's (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each 3 is followed by a (, and the last one is 3(1+3). So how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So the innermost is the 9th 3(...), which is 3(1+3). So that means there are 9 layers, each with 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So maybe I can compute each layer starting from the inside.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3 * Layer1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3 * Layer3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3 * Layer5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3 * Layer7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3 * Layer9 = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but hold on, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I started counting from the innermost, I ended up with 10 layers. Maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3(...) is the first layer, then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me try again more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the layers properly:\n\nLet me denote each step as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 3 * L1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nThen L3 = 1 + L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL4 = 3 * L3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nL5 = 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6 = 3 * L5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nL7 = 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL8 = 3 * L7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nL9 = 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL10 = 3 * L9 = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is L10, which is 3*364 = 1092. So that would be the final result.\n\nBut let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each 3 is followed by a (, and the innermost is (1+3). Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (.\n\n1. The first 3( is the outermost.\n2. Then inside that, another 3(.\n3. Continuing, each time another 3( until the innermost is 3(1+3).\n\nSo how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo that's 9 times. So the innermost is the 9th 3(...), which is 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should have only 9 layers, each time working from the inside out. So maybe I overcounted before.\n\nLet me try again, this time with 9 layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3 * Layer1 = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3 * Layer3 = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3 * Layer5 = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3 * Layer7 = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*364 = 1092. But that would make it 10 layers, but I thought there were only 9.\n\nWait, maybe the initial 3*(...) is the 10th layer. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the original expression starts with 3*(...), which is the first layer, and then each subsequent 3*(...) adds another layer. So if I have 9 layers of 3*(...), then the innermost is the 9th, which is 3*(1+3).\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 9 layers, each 3*(...), leading to the outermost being 3*(Layer9), which would be 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut maybe I should check the count again. Let me try to write out the expression with each layer:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo let me list each layer as L1 to L9:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nL3: 1 + L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL4: 3*(L3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nL5: 1 + L4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6: 3*(L5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nL7: 1 + L6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL8: 3*(L7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nL9: 1 + L8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, so L9 is 364, and then the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nSo that would be the result. But let me confirm by another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a general formula for such a nested expression.\n\nSuppose I have n layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value after n layers.\n\nSo for n=1: a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is (1 + 3), so maybe a_1 = 4, and then each layer adds another 3*(1 + a_{k}).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define it recursively.\n\nLet\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 3*(a_1) = 3*4 = 12\n\na_3 = 1 + a_2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_4 = 3*a_3 = 3*13 = 39\n\na_5 = 1 + a_4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_6 = 3*a_5 = 3*40 = 120\n\na_7 = 1 + a_6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_8 = 3*a_7 = 3*121 = 363\n\na_9 = 1 + a_8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_10 = 3*a_9 = 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo that's 10 layers, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...). So perhaps the initial 3*(...) is the first layer, and each subsequent is another layer. So in that case, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then each layer builds up to the 10th layer, which is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should just compute each step manually without trying to find a pattern.\n\nLet me try to compute each step step by step, writing down each value as I go.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Next: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Next: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Next: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. Next: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nSo that's 10 steps, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers of 3*(...). So the outermost is 3*(result of 9 layers), which is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost. So maybe the initial 3*(...) is the first layer, and each subsequent is another, so with 9 layers, the innermost is (1 + 3), and the outermost is 3*(...). So the total number of operations is 9 layers, each adding a 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps the result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check again by computing step by step:\n\nLet me write the expression from the inside out:\n\nStart with (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen 3*(13) = 39\n\nThen 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen 3*(40) = 120\n\nThen 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen 3*(121) = 363\n\nThen 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen 3*(364) = 1092\n\nSo that's 9 layers of 3*(...), each time adding another layer, ending with 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but how many 3*(...) are there? Let me count the number of times I have 3*(something):\n\n1. 3*(4) = 12\n\n2. 3*(13) = 39\n\n3. 3*(40) = 120\n\n4. 3*(121) = 363\n\n5. 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, that's only 5 times I've used 3*(...). But that doesn't seem right because the original expression has more layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by a (:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo that's 9 times. So each of these is a layer, starting from the outermost to the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 10 layers, but maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nWhere ... is 8 more layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time substituting the inner expression with its value.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each step:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me denote E_n as the expression with n layers.\n\nSo E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but that can't be right because we have more layers. Wait, no, perhaps each E_n represents the value after n layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Next: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Next: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Next: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. Next: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but I only have 9 layers of 3*(...). So perhaps the outermost is 3*(result after 9 layers), which is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the number of 3*(...) is 9. So maybe the final result is 1092.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try to compute it step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3):\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Then compute the next layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Then compute (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Then compute (1 + 39) = 40\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Then compute (1 + 120) = 121\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Then compute (1 + 363) = 364\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nSo that's 10 steps, but the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(...). So the final result is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to keep track:\n\nLayer | Expression | Value\n--- | --- | ---\n1 | (1 + 3) | 4\n2 | 3*(4) | 12\n3 | (1 + 12) | 13\n4 | 3*(13) | 39\n5 | (1 + 39) | 40\n6 | 3*(40) | 120\n7 | (1 + 120) | 121\n8 | 3*(121) | 363\n9 | (1 + 363) | 364\n10 | 3*(364) | 1092\n\nSo after 10 layers, the value is 1092. But in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ...).\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach 3( is a new layer. So starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo that's 9 layers of 3*(...), each time adding a new layer. So the innermost is the 9th 3*(1 + 3) = 12, and the outermost is the first 3*(...), which after computing all inner layers, becomes 3*364 = 1092.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check again by computing each step without making a table:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. 3*13 = 39\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. 3*40 = 120\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. 3*121 = 363\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. 3*364 = 1092\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nSuppose I have n layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to find a general formula.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value after n layers.\n\nSo, for n = 1: a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nFor n = 5: a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so for n=5, a_5=1092, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be much larger. Wait, that can't be right because in our problem, n=9 layers would give a much larger number, but in our earlier computation, we only reached 1092 after 9 layers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Wait, in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So maybe a_1 = 4, a_2 = 12, a_3 = 13, a_4 = 39, etc. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better not to overcomplicate with a general formula and stick to the step-by-step computation, which gave me 1092.\n\nWait, but in my earlier table, I had 10 steps, which would correspond to 9 layers of 3*(...), leading to the final result of 1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach, such as recognizing a pattern or using a recursive formula.\n\nWait, each time we have 3*(1 + previous_value). So starting from 4, each step is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo let me list the values:\n\nStart: 4\n\nThen 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, that's not matching earlier.\n\nWait, no, wait, in our problem, the innermost is 4, then 3*4=12, then 1+12=13, then 3*13=39, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a bit more involved because it alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\n\nSo each layer alternates between:\n\n1. Multiply by 3\n\n2. Add 1\n\nBut in our case, it's:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Multiply by 3: 4*3=12\n\n3. Add 1: 12+1=13\n\n4. Multiply by 3: 13*3=39\n\n5. Add 1: 39+1=40\n\n6. Multiply by 3: 40*3=120\n\n7. Add 1: 120+1=121\n\n8. Multiply by 3: 121*3=363\n\n9. Add 1: 363+1=364\n\n10. Multiply by 3: 364*3=1092\n\nSo that's 10 steps, which corresponds to 9 layers of multiplication by 3 and 9 layers of addition by 1, but alternating.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer after the first involves both adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value after n layers, where each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost.\n\nBut actually, the structure is such that each layer is 3*(1 + previous_value). So each layer is defined as 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo starting from a_1 = 4 (the innermost (1 + 3)),\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, but earlier I had a_2=12.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me check.\n\nWait, in our earlier computation, after (1 + 3)=4, the next step was 3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13, then 3*13=39, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier step-by-step, where after 4, I had 3*4=12, then 1+12=13.\n\nWait, so maybe the recurrence is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence alternates between operations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nEach layer is either 3*(1 + previous) or 1 + previous*3, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the original expression:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)))\n\nSo each layer is 3*(1 + inner_layer).\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3)=4.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 4)=15.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 3*4=12, then 1+12=13, which seems different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each layer is 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo let me compute each layer correctly:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the original expression, the structure is such that each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should compute it as:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, that seems way too large, and it doesn't match my earlier computation.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure of the expression.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), but the way it's nested is that each 3*(...) is inside another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse it as follows:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer).\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nBut that's 9 layers, so the final result would be 36084, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, so which is correct? Did I miscount the layers earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nE1 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, E1 is the entire expression, which equals 36084.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I had a different result of 1092. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I misapplied the operations earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I started from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, then multiplied by 3 to get 39, etc. But that approach alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which may not be the correct way to parse the expression.\n\nWait, actually, the correct way is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer), so starting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = 4\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E9) = 15\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E8) = 48\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E7) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E6) = 444\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E5"

It seems like each level is 1 plus 3 times something, and this repeats multiple times. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost, I see each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, the next level is another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1. Hmm, I think it's nine levels deep. So, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to nine levels. So, the outermost is 3 times the ninth level. So, maybe I can compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first. So, the innermost is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Let me compute that.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so Level 2 is 13. Next level out, we have 1 + 3 times Level 2.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. Let me continue this way. Maybe I can make a table to keep track of each level.\n\nLet me list the levels from 1 to 9 and compute each step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check my calculations again because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting over, maybe I can compute each level step by step, ensuring I don't make an error.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this Level 9 result, right?\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when doing arithmetic quickly, errors can creep in.\n\nStarting from Level 1 to Level 9:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me compute 3 * 29524 again just to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSame result. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each level again step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just check if I miscounted the number of levels. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to nine levels because each opening parenthesis after the first 1 is one level, and I think there are nine of them.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1, each time we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1:\n\nAfter the first 1, the next is 3(, then another 3(, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time, it's 3 followed by (, so the number of opening parentheses is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each level adds another 3(. So, that would make 9 levels, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, Level 9 is indeed the outermost one before multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out, and the multiplication at the end is correct. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. \n\nAlright, so the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Wait, so that's 1 + 3 times 4. Let me compute 3 times 4 first, which is 12. Then, adding 1 gives me 13. \n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, I have 1 + 3(13). Again, I should compute 3 times 13 first. 3 times 13 is 39. Adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3(40). Let me compute 3 times 40, which is 120. Then, adding 1 gives me 121. So, that's 121. \n\nNext up, it's 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is... let me think, 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Adding 1 gives me 364. So, that simplifies to 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, I have 1 + 3(364). Let me calculate 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. \n\nSo, that's 1093. Next, moving out another layer, I have 1 + 3(1093). Let's compute 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. \n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 3280. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. \n\nSo, that's 9841. Now, moving out another layer, I have 1 + 3(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. \n\nSo, that's 29524. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute 3 times 29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. \n\nSo, that simplifies to 88573. Now, moving out another layer, I have 1 + 3(88573). Let me compute 3 times 88573. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. \n\nSo, that's 265720. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3(265720). Let me compute 3 times 265720. 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. \n\nSo, that simplifies to 797161. Now, moving out another layer, I have 1 + 3(797161). Let me compute 3 times 797161. 700000 times 3 is 2100000, 90000 times 3 is 270000, 7000 times 3 is 21000, 100 times 3 is 300, 60 times 3 is 180, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives me 2391484. \n\nSo, that's 2391484. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, the expression is 3 times that, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by all those nested parentheses. So, 3 times 2391484. Let me compute that. 2000000 times 3 is 6000000, 300000 times 3 is 900000, 90000 times 3 is 270000, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 400 times 3 is 1200, 80 times 3 is 240, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 is 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my addition again. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me add 2391484 times 3 again. \n\n2391484 * 3:\n- 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n- 300,000 * 3 = 900,000\n- 90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n- 1,000 * 3 = 3,000\n- 400 * 3 = 1,200\n- 80 * 3 = 240\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\n\nHmm, so that gives me 7,174,452. But wait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. Let me check if I did each step correctly. \n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the digits when I broke it down. Let me try another approach: 2,391,484 times 3. Let's compute it digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4, write down 4.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 7,174,452. Okay, that matches my previous result. So, 3 times 2,391,484 is indeed 7,174,452.\n\nWait a second, but that seems really big. Let me check if I did all the inner computations correctly. Maybe I messed up one of the earlier steps. Let me go back a few layers to see if I made a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Next, 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Then, 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161. Next, 1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484. Finally, 3*2,391,484 = 7,174,452.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I just want to make sure I didn't make any addition or multiplication errors. Let me pick a few steps to verify.\n\nFor example, let's take 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60=360+3=363. Then, 1+363=364. That's correct.\n\nNext, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\n3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. 1+88572=88573. Correct.\n\n3*88573: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. 240000+24000=264000+1500=265500+210=265710+9=265719. 1+265719=265720. Correct.\n\n3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. 600000+180000=780000+15000=795000+2100=797100+60=797160. 1+797160=797161. Correct.\n\n3*797161: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. 2100000+270000=2370000+21000=2391000+300=2391300+180=2391480+3=2391483. 1+2391483=2391484. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*2391484: 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. 6000000+900000=6900000+270000=7170000+3000=7173000+1200=7174200+240=7174440+12=7174452. \n\nSo, after checking each step, it seems like I didn't make any mistakes. Therefore, the final result is 7,174,452. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). But when I worked through it, I ended up with 8 steps before multiplying by 3 at the end. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n14. Finally, 3*2391484 = 7,174,452\n\nWait, so actually, there are 13 layers inside the first 3(...). That explains why the number is so large. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which causes exponential growth. So, it's a geometric series, but nested multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without expanding each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers inside the first 3(...). Wait, no, let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1 + 3(...), starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nLayer 11: 1 + 3*(Layer10) = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nLayer 12: 1 + 3*(Layer11) = 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n\nLayer 13: 1 + 3*(Layer12) = 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer13) = 3*2391484 = 7,174,452\n\nSo, that's 13 layers in total. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nI think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the general solution can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 =1 + 3*4=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 13 layers, so the innermost expression is a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is a_13 = (3^{14} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost operation is 3*(a_13). So, the total expression is 3*a_13 = 3*(3^{14} -1)/2 = (3^{15} -3)/2.\n\nBut wait, let me compute that. 3^{15} is 14,348,907. So, (14,348,907 -3)/2 =14,348,904/2=7,174,452. \n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 7,174,452.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find the value of the entire expression. The final result is:\n\n\\boxed{7174452}"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern I can exploit. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I notice that it's a series of 3 multiplied by a sum that starts with 1 and then has another 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It looks recursive, almost like each step is adding another layer. Let me try to count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. Then, each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. From the innermost, I think there are 9 layers because each \"1 + 3\" is part of a larger expression. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, maybe it's a 9-layer deep expression. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That might be the safest approach to avoid getting lost in the nesting.\n\nLet me write down each step as I compute it.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving on to the next layer:\n\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nContinuing:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. I think I went too far. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is a layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3\" parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me see how many times this happens. Each time, the number of layers increases by one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a term, and each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, if there are 9 layers, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, I went from step 1 to step 9, each time computing the next layer. So, maybe when I reach step 9, that's the innermost part, and then I need to compute the outermost 3*(result).\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... has 8 layers, starting with 1 + 3*(...), so perhaps I need to go one more step.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is 1 + 3*(B), and B is 1 + 3*(C), and so on until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we get 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(A), where A is this 29524. So, the final step would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I thought I went up to 9 layers, but perhaps that was already A, and then the outermost 3*(A) is the final step.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the end, it's 1 + 3, then each preceding is another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 8 layers, because each time we add another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent this as a sequence where each term is defined recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many a's are there? Let's see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on, down to a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I compute a_1 through a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to a_9 = 29524, and then I thought I needed to multiply by 3, but maybe that's not correct because the outermost 3 is already part of the expression.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I compute the innermost part as a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to a_9 = 29524, which would be the value of the innermost expression, but perhaps I'm missing that the outermost 3 is applied to a_9.\n\nWait, let me recount. So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo, 2*10000 = 20000, 9*1000 = 9000, 5*100 = 500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4.\n\nSo, 20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 20 = 29520\n\n29520 + 4 = 29524.\n\nNow, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm my steps again because I'm a bit confused about whether I included the outermost 3 correctly.\n\nWait, so the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, when I computed a_9 = 29524, that was the value inside the outermost 3. So, yes, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me recompute a_9 and then 3*a_9.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this recursive sequence to avoid computing each step manually. Let's see.\n\nThe sequence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. Suppose a_n = C for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because all our a_n are positive integers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}.\n\nSince a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to look at it, and it confirms the result.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check the formula approach.\n\nWe have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 \\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus another similar expression). Maybe it's a recursive-looking expression, where each step depends on the next. Let me see if I can compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. Let me write that down.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check if that's the pattern here.\n\nSo, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let me do that.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nMoving outward again, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check: 3*1093.\n\n1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, is that right? 3*3280: 3280 * 3. Let me compute 3280*3.\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 +1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nSo, now the next layer out is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. 3*9841.\n\n9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 is 29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. But the outermost operation is 3 times the entire inner expression.\n\nWait, so maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, if I have nine layers inside, the total layers would be 9, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, the outermost operation is 3*(result of the ninth layer). So, after computing the ninth layer as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nSo, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nSo, 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent 1 + 3*(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), and inside that is another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\n2. The first inner is 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. Then another 1 + 3(...)\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we have another layer.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer1), which is layer2.\n\nThen, layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on, until layer9, which is 1 + 3*(layer8).\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, in total, we have 9 layers inside, and the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (layer1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer9)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I feel like that might not be right because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with nine layers inside... but maybe I should check if I have the correct number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's eight layers inside, and the outermost is the ninth.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first inner is 1 + 3(...). Then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1 + 3(...)\n\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n4. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n5. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n6. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n7. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n8. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\n9. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\nWait, so actually, the number of \"1 + 3(\" is nine, meaning there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by the ninth layer.\n\nSo, in that case, my earlier calculation is correct: nine layers inside, each computed step by step, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute it without finding the formula, I could just compute each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrive at the same result.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a recursive structure, maybe? Let me try to parse it from the inside out. I think that's how these nested expressions usually work\u2014you start with the innermost part and work your way outward.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result from the previous step. So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\n2. Next level out: (1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = (1 + 3*4).\n\nWait, hold on, is it 3*(1 + 3(...)) or 3*(result)? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nLooking back, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each level is 3 times (1 plus the next level). So, actually, each step is 3*(1 + next_level_result). So, perhaps I should approach it by starting from the innermost and building up each level.\n\nLet me try to list each step clearly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe each level is 3*(1 + previous_level). Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the levels. Let me count how many sets of parentheses there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(...)\" is a level. Let's count the number of 3(...):\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is another level. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 that's the outermost 3.\n\nThen inside it, another 3(1+3(...)), so that's level 2.\n\nContinuing, each time we go in, it's another 3(...). Let me count them.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? Because starting from the innermost, there are 9 closing parentheses before the first 3. Let me check:\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), each subsequent level adds another 3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 levels? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(...)\" is a level. Let me count the number of 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each 3(...) adds another level.\n\nSo, the innermost is level 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen level 2: 3*(1 + level1) = 3*(1+4) = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + level2) = 3*(1+15) = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + level3) = 3*(1+48) = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + level4) = 3*(1+147) = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + level5) = 3*(1+444) = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + level6) = 3*(1+1335) = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + level7) = 3*(1+4008) = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + level8) = 3*(1+12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(1 + level9), but wait, no\u2014the original expression is 3*(1 + level9). Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each level is 3*(1 + next_level). So, perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...).

Wait, no, because the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + level9).

Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + Level9). So, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because in the original problem, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9). But wait, in my previous count, Level9 is 3*(1 + Level8). So, perhaps the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Level9). Wait, but that would make it Level10. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each \"3*(1 + ...)\" as a level, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3)=4. That's not a level of 3*(...), it's just the innermost part.\n\nThen, the next level is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next level is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost level is 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, how many levels are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of 3(...) is 9. Because from the innermost (1+3), each 3(...) adds another level. So, perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nLevel1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(5) = 15.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(16) = 48.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(49) = 147.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(148) = 444.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(445) = 1335.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1336) = 4008.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(4009) = 12027.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(12028) = 36084.\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Level9). Wait, no, because Level9 is already 3*(1 + Level8). So, perhaps the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9). But that would be Level10. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a level, and there are 9 such levels after the initial 3*. So, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each level is 3*(1 + previous_level). So, let's count:\n\nStart with (1+3) = 4. That's the innermost.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\nLevel1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*(36085) = 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9), so the final result would be 108255.\n\nWait, but let me check how many levels there are. The original expression has 9 sets of \"3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 levels of 3*(...). So, perhaps my initial count was correct, and the final result is 108255.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Level9 was 36084, but then the outermost would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but let me recount to make sure.\n\nLet me list each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\n10. Next: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, so that's 10 levels. But in the original expression, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of 3(...) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"3(...)\" is a level. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3(...) is 9, because starting from the innermost (1+3), each time you go out, you have another 3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...), so the outermost is level9, which is 3*(1 + level8). Therefore, my initial count where level9 was 36084 is correct, and the outermost expression is 3*(1 + level9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a level, and there are 9 of them, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let me list them as levels 1 through 9.\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(5) = 15.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(16) = 48.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(49) = 147.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(148) = 444.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(445) = 1335.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1336) = 4008.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(4009) = 12027.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(12028) = 36084.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Level9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, so that's the result. Let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Level1:\n\n1. Level1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nOutermost expression: 3*(1 + Level9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nNow, 36085 * 3: Let's compute that.\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n3 * 30000 = 90000\n\n3 * 6000 = 18000 \u2192 Total so far: 90000 + 18000 = 108000\n\n3 * 85 = 255 \u2192 Total: 108000 + 255 = 108255.\n\nSo, the final result is 108255.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I thought Level9 was 36084, and then the outermost was 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if I miscounted the levels. The original expression has 9 sets of \"3(...)\", so each level is one of those. So, Level1 is the innermost, Level9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, Level9 was 36084, and then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Level9), which would be Level10, but perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the outermost is Level9.\n\nWait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + Level9). So, Level9 is the innermost 3*(1 + ...), and the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9). So, perhaps I should have 9 levels, each being 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost. Therefore, the outermost would be the 9th level, which is 36084. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 36084 is the result of 3*(1 + Level8). So, perhaps the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9), which would be the 10th level, but that's not present in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first innermost part. Then each \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a level. So, the first level is 3*(1 + 3) = 15.\n\nThen the next level is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nContinuing this way, how many levels do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of \"3*(1 + ...)\" in the original expression.\n\nFrom the innermost, each time you go out, you have another 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first 3*(1 + 3) is the first level.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) is another level. So, how many?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of closing parentheses after the innermost (1+3) is 9, so perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to parse it differently.\n\nLet me write the original expression with each level:\n\nLevel1: 3*(1 + 3) = 15.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nSo, the original expression is Level9, which is 108255.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, the final result is 108255.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Level9 was 36084, but that was when I considered the innermost as Level1. So, perhaps I need to adjust my counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the innermost (1+3) is not a level, but just the start. So, the first level is 3*(1 + 3) = 15, then the next level is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to 9 levels.\n\nWait, that would mean the original expression is 3*(1 + Level8), which is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of levels again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(...)\" is a level. So, starting from the innermost, the first 3(...) is (1+3), then each subsequent 3(...) is another level.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), which is inside 9 sets of 3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 15.\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 48.\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 147.\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 444.\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 1335.\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 4008.\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 12027.\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 36084.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Level9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, but in this count, Level9 is 36084, and the outermost is 3*(1 + Level9), which would be Level10. But the original expression only has 9 levels of 3(...). So, perhaps the outermost is Level9, which is 36084, but that doesn't seem right because the original expression is 3*(1 + Level9), implying that the outermost is another level beyond Level9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E(n) as the expression with n levels of nesting.\n\nSo, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), so E(1) would be 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem to match my previous counts. Hmm, perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each level is 3*(1 + previous_level). So, perhaps E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then Level2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Level3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to model it as E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 4.\n\nWait, no, E(1) would be (1 + 3) = 4, then E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*5 = 15, E(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nSo, if we have E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), starting with E(1) = 4.\n\nThen, the original problem has n levels, where n is the number of times we apply E(n). Let me check how many levels there are.\n\nLooking back, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each 3(...) adds another level. So, how many levels? Let's count the number of 3(...) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time you have a 3(...), it's a new level. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3) = 4.\n\n- Then, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n- Then, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\n- Then, the outermost is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, so that's 9 levels after the innermost. So, perhaps the total number of levels is 9, leading to the final result of 108255.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because I'm counting the innermost as level1, then each 3(...) as a level. So, if there are 9 levels, then the final result is 108255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach, such as recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me consider that each level is 3*(1 + previous_level). So, if I denote each level as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 would be (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(16) = 48.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 + d/(c - 1)).\n\nWait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nSo, it's of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c=3 and d=3.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = c^n * (a_0 + d/(c - 1)) - d/(c - 1).\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3.\n\nSo, K - 3K = 3 \u2192 -2K = 3 \u2192 K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait: a_1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, substituting n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1.5 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 \u2192 A = 5.5/3 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nWait, but 5.5 is 11/2, so A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring 3^n:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut let's check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many levels do we have?\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3) as a_1=4, then each level is a_n.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + a_9), because there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, no, let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=15, a_3=48, ..., up to a_9.\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*(1 + a_9).\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n11 * 19683 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 1*19683 = 19683, total = 196830 + 19683 = 216513.\n\nThen, 216513 / 6 = ?\n\nDivide 216513 by 6:\n\n6*36085 = 216510, so 216513 - 216510 = 3, so 36085 + 3/6 = 36085.5.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nWait, that's a whole number, which makes sense because all the a_n are integers.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084.\n\nThen, the original expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108"
