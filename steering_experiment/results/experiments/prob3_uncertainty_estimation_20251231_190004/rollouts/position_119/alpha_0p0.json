In our problem, we have 9 layers, but wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. This method using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form expression is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for 9 layers, both methods work.

The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Since the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3, does that mean 9 layers? Wait, let me check the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: Each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So the entire expression has 9 layers because each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, n = 9 layers. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Let me check the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each set of parentheses adds a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost 1+3, that's layer 1. Each time we go out, it's another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: There are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would be 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time going outward. So, n=9. Therefore, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the total can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. But the closed-form approach seems more straightforward here. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer computes to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524, and multiplying that by the outermost 3 gives us 88572. I think that's thorough enough.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since there are only 9 layers, it's not too bad to compute each one. Let me just double-check my computations for each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Starting from the inside: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279.

Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. All steps check out.

Wait, let's check: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then Layer 2 is a_2, up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the formula for the recurrence, I could have noticed that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a geometric series.

If we expand this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe the general term is a sum of a geometric series. Specifically, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
