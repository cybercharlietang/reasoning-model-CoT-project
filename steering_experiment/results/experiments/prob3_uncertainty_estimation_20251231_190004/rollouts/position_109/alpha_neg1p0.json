Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. Good. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.
