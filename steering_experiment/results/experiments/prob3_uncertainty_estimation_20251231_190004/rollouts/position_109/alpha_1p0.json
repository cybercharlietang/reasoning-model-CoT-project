Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, as we computed. The outermost layer is layer 9, which would correspond to n=9 in the formula. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from 4, each step is multiplied by 3 and then add 1. But since we have 9 layers, it's easier to compute each step as I did before. Either way, the result is the same. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, we confirm that the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
