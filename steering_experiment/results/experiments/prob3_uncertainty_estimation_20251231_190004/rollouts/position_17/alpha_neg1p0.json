    "text": " So, Layer 1 is the innermost expression, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating that, 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... Let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me calculate that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n9*3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Maybe I should go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion.\n\nLet's denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. Then, the recursion is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3, (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times the first layer. Hmm, no, actually, let me check again. The expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (another 1 + 3 multiplied by...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then the next one is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), that's Layer 2. Then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) is Layer 3, and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is an opening parenthesis, and the first one is followed by another \"1+3(\", and so on. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis is one more layer.

Let me count: 1. 3(1+3(...), then 2. inside that, another 3(...), and so on. How many times does 3(1+3(...) occur? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. Wait, no, let me count: Each time, it's 3(1+3(...), so after the initial 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times 3( occurs after the initial 3.

Wait, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).

Let me see: The first is 3(1+3(...), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times 3( appears after the initial 3. So, after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let me count: 1. 3(1+3( 2. 3(1+3( 3. 3(1+3( 4. 3(1+3( 5. 3(1+3( 6. 3(1+3( 7. 3(1+3( 8. 3(1+3( 9. 3(1+3) So, actually, there are 9 layers. Wait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The first is 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on.

Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(. Let me count the number of 3( after the initial 3: 1. 3(1+3( 2. 3(1+3( 3. 3(1+3( 4. 3(1+3( 5. 3(1+3( 6. 3(1+3( 7. 3(1+3( 8. 3(1+3( 9. 3(1+3) Hmm, so actually, there are 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 8 layers. Wait, no, because the innermost is 1+3, which is the 9th layer. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: The outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on, until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3. So, there are 9 layers in total. Let me confirm: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 1 (innermost) as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), because the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part is Layer 1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misnumbering. Let me try to think differently. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define L_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 3)), etc. So, actually, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, starting from L_1 to L_9, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, actually, if I have 9 layers, then L_1 is the innermost, and L_9 is the outermost. But in the expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), so perhaps I need to adjust the numbering. Alternatively, maybe it's better to work from the innermost outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let me start by computing Layer 1, which is the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), right? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is Layer 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc. So, if Layer 9 is the outermost, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me try to clarify. Let's consider the expression as follows:\n\nThe entire expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, E = 3*(L1), where L1 = 1 + 3*(L2), L2 = 1 + 3*(L3), ..., L8 = 1 + 3*(L9), and L9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from L9, which is 1 + 3, then L8 = 1 + 3*L9, and so on, up to L1 = 1 + 3*L2.\n\nThen, E = 3*L1.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute L9 first, then L8, up to L1, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, let me adjust my approach.\n\nCompute L9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*L1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because earlier I thought the entire expression was 3*(Layer 9), but now I'm seeing that it's 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the numbering.\n\nWait, let's parse the expression again carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) because the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, that can't be because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, perhaps I'm misnumbering.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as follows: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first term. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have n layers, the total expression would be 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which suggests that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 3s in the expression. Each \"3(\" indicates a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 8 more \"3(\" instances, each indicating a new layer. Therefore, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(Layer n). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) because the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in the expression, it's 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, perhaps I'm misnumbering the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the layers as starting from the innermost and working outward, so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me try that.\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers of 3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, that would mean 8 multiplications by 3 inside, right? Because each \"3*\" is a multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expression has 8 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3*( after the initial 3. So, the first is 3*(1 + 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count how many times 3*( occurs after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, each subsequent 3*( is another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\nSo, there are 8 layers after the initial 3, meaning 8 multiplications by 3. Therefore, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, that can't be because the initial 3 is multiplied by Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, perhaps I need to adjust the numbering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each 3*( as a separate layer, starting from the innermost. Let me try that approach.\n\nCompute starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) because the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, perhaps I'm misnumbering the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices to clarify:\n\nE = 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 1 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\n...\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, starting from Layer 9, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*Layer 1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nE = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only 9), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} can be expressed as L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, L_1 is 4, L_2 is 13, L_3 is 40, etc.\n\nWait, if I consider the general solution for L_n, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me try that.\n\nAssume L_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression E = 3*L_1, but wait, in our earlier approach, E = 3*L_1, where L_1 was the outermost layer. But according to this formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so L_1 would be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our initial computation.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the entire expression is E = 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is L_1 = 29524. Wait, no, that can't be because according to the formula, L_1 = 4, but in our problem, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 4, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which is 29524. So, the entire expression is E = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, if we have n layers, then L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, with 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*L_9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, which would make L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, which matches our earlier computation of Layer 2 as 9841. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the indexing.\n\nWait, in our earlier step-by-step computation, Layer 9 was the innermost, which was 4, and Layer 1 was the outermost, which was 29524. But according to the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if we have 9 layers, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which would be the innermost layer. But in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 4, corresponding to n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = 4. So, perhaps the formula is correct if we consider that the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9, with L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is E = 3*L_1, but that doesn't make sense because L_1 is the innermost. Wait, no, in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is the outermost layer, which would be L_9 in the formula. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is that for k layers, the value is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, if we have 9 layers, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it now. Each layer adds another 3*(...) on the outside, so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, and verifying with the formula, I arrive at the conclusion that the entire expression equals 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1 (innermost):**  \n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n9. **Layer 9 (outermost):**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, putting it all together: 27 (from 9*3) followed by 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I multiply 29524 by 3, I should get 88572. Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplying by 3, the result should be 6 digits. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.

So, I need to compute Layer 9 first, which is 1 + 3(Layer 8), then Layer 8 is 1 + 3(Layer 7), and so on, until I get to Layer 1. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.

Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, so write down the last carry, which is 0? Wait, no, the number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. So, the multiplication would be:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n3 \u00d75=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n3\u00d79=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n3\u00d72=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12.\n\nWait, that's 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error in arithmetic with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12 =13. Correct.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 +3\u00d713 =1 +39=40. Correct.\n\n4. Layer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\n5. Layer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\n6. Layer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Layer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. Layer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Layer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, final step: 3\u00d729524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. It took a while, but by breaking it down step by step, I managed to compute each layer without getting lost. I had to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid mistakes, especially with larger numbers. But by taking it one step at a time, it worked out.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the entire expression. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating this: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, what's 29524 times 3? Let me compute it step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\n29524 * 3: \n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 9, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carry.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572? Let me check that with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculations because one error could throw off the entire result. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n, which might help verify my result.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, using the formula, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThis makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88572. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with repetitive and nested operations where it's easy to make a calculation error. But by using both the step-by-step layer approach and the general formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. The expression can be seen as repeatedly adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. The formula I derived earlier, (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is actually the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having n+1 terms. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{k} - 1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and k is the number of terms. In our case, each layer is adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which can be thought of as a series where each term is 3^{n}.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is built by adding 1 and scaling by 3. So, the formula we derived, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is indeed the sum of the geometric series 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but divided by 2. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, actually, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. But in our case, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is similar but not exactly the same as the sum. However, our solution L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 does match the sum of the geometric series, which makes sense because each layer effectively adds another term in the geometric progression.\n\nSo, that's another way to see why the formula works: each layer is effectively summing the geometric series up to that point. Therefore, for Layer 9, we're summing up to 3^9, but since our formula is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what we used earlier.\n\nIn any case, whether I approach it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or think of it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. This consistency across different methods makes me very confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI guess the key takeaway here is that when faced with a nested expression like this, especially one that repeats a similar structure, it's helpful to look for patterns or recurrence relations that can simplify the computation. Instead of computing each layer manually, which can be error-prone and time-consuming, recognizing the underlying mathematical structure allows for a more efficient and elegant solution.\n\nAdditionally, verifying the result through multiple methods is a good practice to ensure accuracy, especially in high-stakes situations or when dealing with complex problems. It might seem like overkill, but it's better to be certain than to have lingering doubts about whether a mistake was made.\n\nSo, to summarize my thought process: I started by identifying the nested structure and realized that working from the innermost layer outward was the way to go. I computed each layer step by step, then derived a general formula using recurrence relations to confirm my result. Finally, I connected the problem to geometric series to further validate the solution. Through all these steps, I arrived at the final answer of 88572, and I'm confident that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Now, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12, so 900+180+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240, so 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, but wait, in this case, the recurrence starts at L_1=4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, let me write it out for n layers: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So, I need to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\nThen, 3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\nNext, 3 * 500 = 1,500\n\nThen, 3 * 20 = 60\n\nAnd finally, 3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can do it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives us 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this nested expression without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let's see if we can model this.\n\nIf I write out the entire expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the method, I keep getting 88,572. It seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute this using another approach, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and summing it up. Let's see.\n\nEach time we have a term 1 + 3*(...), which can be thought of as a geometric series with ratio 3. However, since each term is added before multiplying by 3, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on.\n\nThis is similar to an infinite geometric series, but in this case, it's finite with 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent this as a finite sum.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nBut actually, since each layer is a separate multiplication, maybe it's better to think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, without layers, just to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing this way, as I did before, leads to the same numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly from multiple angles, using both step-by-step computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. So, Layer 6 is 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. So, Layer 7 is 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. So, Layer 8 is 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers seem to be increasing as expected. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, calculating each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, that's a jump. Let me check my calculations so far.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems correct so far. Let's proceed.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's do this step by step. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2, 1, 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 877572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number, but my digit-by-digit method gave me 877572, which is 6 digits. I must have messed up the alignment.\n\nWait, let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 7 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), and the 2 was in the units place, but that's already covered. Wait, actually, when multiplying, each digit is placed in the correct column.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n\n\u00d7          3\n\n-------------\n\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens place:7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds place:5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 thousands place:7, carryover 0\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 ten-thousands place:7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 hundred-thousands place:8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my initial calculation. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 =4\n\nNext layer:1 + 3*4=13\n\nOutermost layer:1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120.\n\nYes, that works. So, my method seems to be correct.\n\nAnother test: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's see.\n\nInnermost:1 +3=4\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13\n\nOutermost:3*13=39.\n\nAlternatively: 3(1 + 3(4))=3(1 +12)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach is validated with smaller numbers. Therefore, I'm confident that the original problem evaluates to 88572.\n\nI think that's the answer. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I just had to make sure I computed each layer correctly and didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially with the larger numbers towards the end.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, okay. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think I messed up the digits. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer was computed step by step, and each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from layer 1, which is 4, layer 2 is 13, layer 3 is 40, layer 4 is 121, layer 5 is 364, layer 6 is 1093, layer 7 is 3280, layer 8 is 9841, layer 9 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I computed each layer correctly because sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that each layer is being multiplied by 3, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the entire expression. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. So each layer is getting bigger, but I wonder if there's a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern or maybe find a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me verify each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, so all the layers check out. Each step seems correct. So, maybe 88572 is indeed the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that can simplify the computation without having to calculate each layer individually. The expression is a series of nested multiplications and additions, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The closed-form solution for a_n is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1*r^{n} - c*r^{n})/(1 - r). Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The homogeneous solution is when c=0, but here c is not zero, so we have a nonhomogeneous recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, that's perfect! So, the closed-form formula works for each layer. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did, and it worked out. But having a formula is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3(Layer 1) Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, compute 3 * 29524. Let's calculate that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but let me check the layers again to make sure each step was correct. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did earlier. Alternatively, I can express L_n in terms of L_{n-1}, and so on, which would lead to L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is the same as the original problem. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, no, let's do it properly. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me verify:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3 is the same as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Compute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the layers. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLet me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought it was nine layers, but the way it's written, it's actually nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, nine layers. So, my initial breakdown was correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost. Therefore, the calculation seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine terms, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. However, in this case, since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, the result is consistent. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 one more time:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15. Write down 5, carry over1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down8, carry over2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3. Break it down as (29000 + 524)*3.\n\n29000 *3=87000\n\n524*3=1572\n\nAdd them together: 87000 +1572=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, each layer is computed step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, okay. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... Let me compute that: 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Let's move on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Wait, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, that seems right. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Alright, 121. Let's continue to Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Hmm, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.

Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Hmm, that's a big number. Let me double-check that: 3 times 3280 is indeed 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, that seems correct. 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it together: 88572.

Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer's computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me just check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something like that, but given the structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me recompute a_3: a_2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\na_4: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\na_5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\na_6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\na_7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\na_8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\na_9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nAssume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nWait, that's a negative number, but our a_n are all positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\n=> K - 3K = 1\n\n=> -2K = 1\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 =4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to verify the result.\n\n4. Both methods led to the same final result, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty sure that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Layers**: The expression has 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3 is 15 plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed correctly, and the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), so let's see:\n\nInnermost: (1+3) = 4 (Layer 1)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13 (Layer 2)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40 (Layer 3)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121 (Layer 4)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364 (Layer 5)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093 (Layer 6)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280 (Layer 7)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841 (Layer 8)\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524 (Layer 9)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. There are nine layers inside, each adding another 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost 3 times the ninth layer. So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's plug n = 1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a power of 3, but with some adjustments. Since each L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then L_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified the result using a formula derived from recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence. Both methods led me to the same conclusion, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers of nesting before the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, okay, each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, the numbers are growing exponentially. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here or if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, because this might take a while. Wait, maybe it's a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_n is the nth layer. So, starting from L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that for such recursions, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by L_n = (L_1 + (b)/(a - 1))*(a)^{n-1} - (b)/(a - 1). Let me check that formula. Alternatively, I think the closed-form solution is L_n = (L_1 - c) * a^{n} + c, where c is a constant. Maybe I should derive it step by step. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to compute a few terms to see the pattern. L_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify these calculations step by step because I might have made a mistake in my earlier steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, if Layer 9 is 29,524, then the total expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29,524 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. So, adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer without computing each one. Let me think about it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making any calculation mistakes. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2:\n\n243 * 243:\n\nFirst, compute 200*243 = 48,600\n\nThen, 40*243 = 9,720\n\nThen, 3*243 = 729\n\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 = 59,049, so L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). So, that's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11} and 3*1 = 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 is 59,049 * 3 = 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144 / 2 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify each step once more.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nPerfect, both methods give the same result.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. So, I'll compute each layer step by step. Let's get started.\n\n**Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 equals 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** Moving on to Layer 4, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we take 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so I think my final answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, I can compute Layer 9 directly without having to compute all the previous layers step by step, which would be useful if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, this confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it, using exponents.\n\nThis makes me think that for such nested expressions, especially when they follow a pattern like this, finding a closed-form solution can save a lot of time, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible, but it's good to know that the formula exists for future reference.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, I arrived at the solution 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by using a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, unless I made a calculation error in both methods, which is possible but unlikely, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again using the closed-form expression.\n\nLayer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm good.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, my plan is to compute Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, wait a second. Let me check the multiplication for Layer 9 again because 9841*3 is 29523, right? Yes, because 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way. 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524*2. 29524*2: 20000*2=40000, 9000*2=18000, 500*2=1000, 20*2=40, 4*2=8. So, 40000 + 18000 = 58000, +1000 = 59000, +40 = 59040, +8 = 59048. So, 29524*2=59048. Now, adding another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let me compute that. 59048 + 29524: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 48 + 524 = 572. Wait, that might not be the best way. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n59048\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7, plus 1 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, so I feel confident about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the entire expression. Let me begin with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. I can break this down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 4: 121, correct. Layer 5: 364, correct. Layer 6: 1093, correct. Layer 7: 3280, correct. Layer 8: 9841, correct. Layer 9: 29524, correct.

So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check another way. Maybe I can see a pattern here because each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, the outermost layer, Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*a_9.\n\nFrom the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11} first: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each layer, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed sequentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the ninth layer by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 3 would then be: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me write this down more systematically. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me check my calculations because that seems like it's growing very rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, in my previous calculation, I had 3*40 as 121, but 3*40 is actually 120, so adding 1 gives 121. That's correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding them up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check this final multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. So, 29524 multiplied by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 + 1=7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n- The next digits are 0s, so we're done.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute 29524*3 another way. Let's compute 30000*3=90000, then subtract (30000 - 29524)*3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476*3=1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, confident now that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer step by step, especially with such large numbers, but breaking it down and verifying each step helped ensure accuracy. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which made computing the result much faster and easier, especially since the number of layers is quite large (nine layers). This approach is probably more efficient for similar problems with many layers, as it avoids repetitive calculations.\n\nAnother thing I could have considered is whether there's a connection to the number of terms or a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one in a linear way, the recurrence relation seemed like the right path. It's also interesting how the numbers grow exponentially because of the factor of 3 at each layer. Each additional layer multiplies the previous total by 3 and adds 1, which leads to rapid growth\u2014exponential growth, to be precise. This kind of pattern is similar to how certain financial investments grow with compound interest, where each period's interest is added to the principal, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\nIn any case, after carefully computing each layer and verifying through both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure there are no arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with large numbers where it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost and compute each layer step by step:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNext, Layer 2: 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so it's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1. Let's get started.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3\nOkay, Layer 1 is straightforward. It's just 1 plus 3. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3(Layer 2)\nLayer 3 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3(Layer 3)\nLayer 4 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3(Layer 4)\nLayer 5 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3(Layer 5)\nLayer 6 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3(Layer 6)\nLayer 7 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3(Layer 7)\nLayer 8 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me calculate that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3(Layer 8)\nLayer 9 is 1 plus 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost, and each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. After computing all nine layers, we end up with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives us the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I did each step correctly.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the numbers add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the entire expression. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's move to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me just check 29524*3 once more. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but by breaking it down step by step, it's manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, I can compute each layer sequentially. Let me write that down step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 will be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Wow, it's increasing quickly.

The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29,000 = 87,000 3*524 = 1,572 So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given how each layer is tripling the previous one and adding 1, it makes sense that it's growing exponentially. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. 27000 +2523=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then, the total expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572. Wait, that's 88,572, which is the same as before. So, that's consistent. Hmm, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that seems correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression has nine layers, right? Each time, we compute the innermost layer first, which is Layer 1, then Layer 2, all the way up to Layer 9. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 3*29524=88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let's see. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 +3=4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2. So, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, that's a formula for a_n, where a_n is the nth layer. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's good. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. Plus, the formula makes sense because each layer is tripling the previous and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth, and the formula reflects that. So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer, each step seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify a couple of layers to ensure consistency. For Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've computed it correctly. Each layer was straightforward once I broke it down, and working from the inside out made it manageable. I didn't skip any steps, so I'm confident in the result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, okay. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number. Let me check if I did each step correctly because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar?\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is when n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. This confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since it's nested, the formula approach was more efficient.\n\nIn conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me calculate that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently would be easier. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\n8 * 3 = 24. Write down 4, carry over 2.\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carry over of 2? Wait, no, because 29524 has only five digits. So, after the 9 (which is the fifth digit from the right), we don't have any more digits, so the carry over 2 would become the next digit. So, the result is 88572. So, yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just check my calculations again because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution was a much more efficient way than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work, but the closed-form is definitely faster.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and applied the formula directly. It's good to know that such recurrence relations can often be solved with standard techniques, which can save a lot of time.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently and verify it step by step.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I should be able to get the final answer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication because 29524*3 might have a faster way. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from the bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me quickly recap each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3\u00d740=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nEach step seems correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that expressions like this sometimes form a geometric series or follow a pattern that can be expressed with a formula, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, okay, that's a bit bigger. Let's go to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Wow, that's jumping up quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, 121. That's interesting. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Hmm, 364.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40 Got it, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 Let me calculate 3*40: that's 120. So, Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 360 + 3 = 363. So, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364 Got it, Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Let me calculate 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Now, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original problem is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the 9th layer, L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Substituting Layer 4, that's 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Substituting Layer 5's value, that's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Substituting Layer 6's value, that's 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Substituting Layer 7's value, that's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Substituting Layer 8's value, that's 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, that seems really large. Let me double-check my calculations because that number seems quite big, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to verify.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Hmm, that seems correct, but it's a very large number. Let me check if I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis is another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, hold on, that's actually ten layers? Because the first 3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ...)). So, each time you have a 3 multiplied by a term that starts with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, there are nine layers in total. So, my initial calculation was correct, with Layer9 being 29524.\n\nBut let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one, which seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where d is the steady-state value.\n\nTo find d, set L_n = L_{n-1} = d:\n\nd = 1 + 3*d\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to compute 3*(Layer9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me verify:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, because 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach, let me verify L_1 through L_9 using the closed-form formula.\n\nUsing L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers match with the closed-form formula, which gives me more confidence that my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, my plan is to compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, I need to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and the multiplication and addition seem accurate. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
