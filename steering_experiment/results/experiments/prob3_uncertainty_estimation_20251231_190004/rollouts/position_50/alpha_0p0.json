    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, to verify, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back a step. When I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. But is that correct? Let me retrace my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, that seems right. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but given the nesting, it's possible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Each time we have 3 multiplied by a term that includes another 3, so perhaps it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). So, if I let x be the entire expression, then x = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) but that seems recursive. Wait, but in reality, the expression is finite, with 9 layers, so it's not an infinite series. So, maybe the formula I found earlier is the most straightforward way. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds. Let me compute up to layer 4 using both the step-by-step method and the formula. Layer 1: 4 (from formula: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4). Layer 2: 13 (formula: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13). Layer 3: 40 (formula: (81-1)/2=80/2=40). Layer 4: 121 (formula: (243-1)/2=242/2=121). Correct. So, the formula works for these layers. Therefore, trusting the formula, layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one layer, which propagates through all subsequent layers.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together: The innermost Layer 1 is 4, each subsequent layer adds more until Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this relation, we compute the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and there are nine of them. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, yes, I think I did each layer correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider L_0 = 1 (since if there were no layers, it would just be 1), but actually, in our case, the innermost layer is L_1 = 4. Wait, maybe it's better to adjust the indices. Alternatively, let's consider the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. So 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Let me check Layer 7 again. Layer 6 is 1,093. So Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. That seems correct. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it as 29524. So, 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. Then, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would make it 28, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, 29524 is the number. So, breaking it down digit by digit: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: Starting from units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 *3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3)=90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This kind of recursive relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to model it. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3C - 1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result.

But wait, let me double-check my computations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think if there's a pattern or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let's see, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the same as before. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Okay, so that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before, so that confirms it. Alternatively, without using the recurrence relation, just computing each layer step by step gives the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I end up with 88572.

Wait, that gives me 88572? Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but let me verify this because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, I feel like this number is quite large, and I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the layers. Let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, L_3=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the final answer is 3*L_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume that L_n = C for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but our layers are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. Let's write out the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's try to express L_n in terms of L_1. Expanding the recurrence:\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_1\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*L_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_1\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n}*L_1\n\nWait, let's test this formula. For n=1: L_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 + 3^1*4 = (3-1)/2 + 12 = 1 +12=13, but L_1 is actually 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is slightly different.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10}=59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this multiplication because I feel like 3*29524 might be a bit off. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476)*3=30000*3 -476*3=90000 -1428=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I went through each layer step by step, verified the pattern, found a formula to compute the nth layer, and then applied it to find the final result. I also double-checked the multiplication to ensure accuracy. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation. Using a formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can express a_n in terms of a_1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which simplifies the computation. Multiplying the result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n can be expressed in terms of a_{n-1}. But solving this recurrence relation might be more efficient. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer manually, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify that because I feel like maybe I missed a step in the layers.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). There are nine layers of 1+3*(...), so Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, the general term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the iterative step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in the final value of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so I think I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Let me recount the layers: Starting from the innermost, each step is a new layer, so 1+3 is Layer 1, then 1+3*(Layer1) is Layer2, and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I computed Layer3, I got 40, then Layer4 was 121, Layer5 364, Layer6 1093, Layer7 3280, Layer8 9841, Layer9 29524. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) So, I think that's right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's nine layers. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid now. I used both iterative computation and a formula approach, and both led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by iteratively computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_k. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern initially, the step-by-step approach would still lead me to the correct answer. It's reassuring to see that both methods agree. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let's recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I included the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, there are 9 layers in total, right? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time there's a (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression using a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems consistent. But let me think about another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case there's a pattern or a geometric series involved. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 \u21d2 L_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*L_p = 1 \u21d2 L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, the 9th layer is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*((3^{10} -1)/2)= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I calculated earlier. The general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me test it for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the closed-form formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and since it's a linear recurrence, the closed-form formula gives the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I just thought of something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...). So, I computed Layer 9 correctly, which is the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me see: Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\n- The first innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...))\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 opening parentheses, which means 9 layers. So, each layer is as I computed before, up to layer 9. Therefore, my initial computation of layer 9 as 29524 is correct, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers are correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is computed correctly, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent 1+3(....) adds a layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...)\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3(...) appears, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(...)\n\nBut how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1+3(...\n\nSo, in the given expression, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2: 3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another ( at position 5: 3(1+3(...)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n\n2. Inside that, another ( at the next 1+3(...\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we see a \"(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet's count:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3: Layer 1\n\n2. The next \"(\" inside that: Layer 2\n\n3. Next: Layer 3\n\n4. Layer 4\n\n5. Layer 5\n\n6. Layer 6\n\n7. Layer 7\n\n8. Layer 8\n\n9. Layer 9\n\nWait, but the innermost part is 1+3, which doesn't have any more parentheses. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, each computed step by step, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me verify again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of layers by looking at the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1+3(...\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. Then, moving out, each layer is 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me try to count the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as each time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer, and the total number of layers is 9, including the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as 1+3, Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, which was 1+3*(Layer8). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nBut when I multiplied by 3 at the end, that was the initial 3 outside all the layers.\n\nSo, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, and the final result is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation of each layer.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That's a recursive formula, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for it.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nIf I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer9, which is n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Alternatively, we can model this recursively. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier manual computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which can be seen as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. However, since each term is nested, it's a bit different, but the recursive approach worked well. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3 * 29524 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me try that to confirm. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them digit by digit:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\nSo, the sum is 88572. That matches my previous result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes, when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one layer, which propagates outward.

So, I think I've got it right. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
