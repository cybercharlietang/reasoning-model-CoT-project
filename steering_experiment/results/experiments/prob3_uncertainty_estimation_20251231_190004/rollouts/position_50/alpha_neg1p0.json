    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step without breaking it into parts. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify this multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. Suppose each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer iteratively**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost factor**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified the process. Let me see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This kind of sequence can be represented as a geometric series, perhaps? Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and applied the formula without computing each layer step by step. But since the problem had nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable, though time-consuming. It's good to know that both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems recursive. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, we can write the recurrence relation as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form formula. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as before, a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through both iterative computation and finding a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

There are no more digits, so write down the last carry, which is 2. So putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering how each layer was tripling and adding, it might make sense. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), and I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is the innermost part. But actually, each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then added. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent Layer 2 to Layer 9 wraps around that. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a base case of a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I can compute a_9, then the entire expression would be 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation with a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a base-3 number or something else, but I think the methods I've used are solid. It's also possible to compute this using iteration, but since I've already used two methods to get the same result, I think it's safe to conclude that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer increases n by 1. Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another power of 3. Using the formula we derived, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, let me count again. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), and this repeats 8 more times, making a total of 9 layers. So n=9.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which according to the formula, should be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, using the formula, I can also compute it without expanding each layer, which would be more efficient for larger n. But since n=9 here, it's manageable either way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So the result should be 88572? Let me verify:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if I computed the layers correctly because 9 layers seem like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the multiplication because sometimes even small mistakes can happen. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also gives the same result.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can be solved explicitly. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Each time we go out, it's another layer. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think I did that correctly. Let me just check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the layers are a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me find D first by setting the homogeneous equation to zero. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D. Now, substituting into the original equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging the general solution into this: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before! So, this confirms that a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation also led me to the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to ensure each layer is correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a geometric progression, maybe? Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can apply instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let's count again. The expression is 3*(...), and inside there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3, then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). So, layer9 is the one we computed as 29524, which is a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, layer9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more by computing a few layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For layer1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f layer2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f layer3: n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f layer4: n=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f layer5: n=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f layer6: n=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f layer7: n=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f layer8: n=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f layer9: n=9, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, all layers match the formula. Therefore, the final computation is correct. Multiplying layer9 by 3 gives 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time you're adding 1 and three times the previous value. This looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me see if I can derive it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = B, so B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can do 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all layers seem correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.

Wait, let me check that again because when I compute 29524 * 3, it should be: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify that with a different method. 29524 * 3 can also be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a geometric series involved here. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so it's a geometric progression. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Starting from the innermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of it as each layer adds another term in the geometric series. Wait, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, 4 is 3 + 1, which is 3^1 +1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13=3^2 +1 + something? Wait, 3^2 is 9, 13-9=4, which is 3^1 +1.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to look for a pattern in the a_n terms we found earlier. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as before. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result again. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without having to go through each layer. That's pretty efficient. So, the problem is essentially evaluating a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^10, but with a specific structure in the expression. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence helps in solving it more efficiently. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, the step-by-step computation would still work, albeit being more time-consuming. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Let me just recap the entire process to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that all adds up correctly. Another way to think about it is that each layer is contributing an additional power of 3. Since there are nine layers, the highest power involved is 3^9, but since the expression is multiplied by 3 at the end, it goes up to 3^10. Wait, actually, let me think about that again. Each layer n corresponds to 3^n in the formula. So, layer 1 is 3^1, layer 2 is 3^2, up to layer 9 being 3^9. But since the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. It's like summing a geometric series where each term is 3^n for n from 1 to 10, but with some coefficients. Wait, actually, the expression is more like a sum of 3^n terms, but each nested. So, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach since that directly models the nested structure. In any case, all methods point to the same final answer: 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct result. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the multiple approaches all lead to the same number. So, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, so n=9. Thus, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's good. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a miscalculation. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), which I've computed as 88572. Let me count the layers again to ensure I didn't miscount. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent Layer adds another 3*(previous Layer). So, 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, each time we add another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 1 is innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers check out, and the multiplication seems correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost, and each result is used in the next layer. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

So 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But I thought the expression was 3*(Layer9), so yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1+3\n\nLayer2:1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\nLayer4:1+3(Layer3)\n\nLayer5:1+3(Layer4)\n\nLayer6:1+3(Layer5)\n\nLayer7:1+3(Layer6)\n\nLayer8:1+3(Layer7)\n\nLayer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo yes, 9 layers, so Layer9 is the outermost one, which is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing it step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nBut since we've already computed up to a9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant.\n\nTo find D, we can set the equation:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D -3D=1 \u2192 -2D=1 \u2192 D= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the recurrence relation approach also confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, that's five digits. So when multiplying by 3, we go digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nBut wait, that's only five digits. So, after multiplying each digit:\n\n4 \u2192 2 (carry 1)\n\n2 \u2192 7 (no carry beyond this)\n\n5 \u2192 5 (carry 1)\n\n9 \u2192 8 (carry 2)\n\n2 \u2192 8 (carry 2)\n\nBut wait, after the first digit, 4, we have 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (from 29524) \u00d73=6 +1=7, no carry.\n\nNext digit:5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d73: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 2 = 59048, then add 29524: 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Each time, it's inside another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so the total number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). So, that's three layers. Let's compute that manually.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nOutermost: 3*(1+3*13)=3*(1+39)=3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, using my method:\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer 3:40\n\nThen multiply by 3: 120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3(4))=3(1 +12)=3*13=39\n\nWait, wait, that's different. Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), the innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*(that), so 3*40=120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for a smaller version.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I get 88572 as the answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work, just to confirm. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is a term in the sequence. The expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +39=40. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b -1) + initial term. Wait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b -1) + C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, actually, let me think again. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, since this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, we can solve it by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = K*3^n, where K is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (a=1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)}=C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = K*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = K*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3K -1/2 => 3K=4 +1/2=9/2 => K= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without expanding each layer, I could have used the formula directly. Since there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, using the formula, Layer 9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, this seems like each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's good. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's see: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. The expression can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 1. So, the total number of layers is 9, but because of the multiplication by 3 each time, it's effectively a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, but adjusted because of the structure. Wait, actually, let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be written as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) and so on. This is similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, we saw that the total is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is equal to (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. The sum inside is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, multiplied by 3 each time, for 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9). The sum of a geometric series is (r^n -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, n=10. So, sum = (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, either way, the answer is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems feasible. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Let's find another condition. For n=2, a_2=1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, when n=2, a_2=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula saved me time instead of computing each layer. That was a good exercise. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this faster. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This looks like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=0, what would L0 be? Well, if we consider n=0, L0 would be 1, because L1 = 1 + 3*L0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, L0=1. Plugging into the general solution: L0=1= A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 2) A + B = 1 (from n=0) Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually using the formula to see if it aligns. For example, Layer 4: n=4, L4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 *3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems to check out. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to cross-verify. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. After computing all layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step or applying a closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or use recursion. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3, b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b/(a - 1)). Let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear recurrence relation. For L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps L_n = 3^{n}*(L_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think again. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L_1 given. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^{n}. The particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^{n} + K. Applying initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*a^{1} + K = C*3 + K. So, 4 = 3C + K. But K = b/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step.

That seems correct. Wait, but when I look at the problem again, the outermost operation is 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's 3*29524 = 88572. But let me think again. Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times? Wait, actually, let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So starting from the innermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each next layer is (1 + 3*(...))\nSo, the expression has nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)), right? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each time we move out, we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me try computing a few layers again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for n >= 2, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nBut let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another similar expression})\\).

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again because I think I messed up the place values. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carryover 2, write 7. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n= (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3\n\n= 30000 \u00d7 3 - 476 \u00d7 3\n\n= 90000 - 1428\n\n= 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check the layers because I think I might have made a mistake in computing them.\n\nLet me go back and compute each layer step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layer computations. Sometimes, when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, does that mean that the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, as I computed? Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I let each layer be defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThen, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume L_n^p = D (a constant).\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my earlier computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L_n directly, which might have saved some time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I only had nine layers, computing each step was manageable. However, it's good to know that the formula exists for future reference.\n\nSo, in summary, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n3. For each layer, compute the value step by step.\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n5. Verify the result using an alternative method, such as recognizing the pattern and applying the formula for the recurrence relation.\n\nThis approach ensures that I don't make mistakes in the computation and that I can handle similar problems in the future more efficiently.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by computing each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer step by step again, just to be thorough. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into this general solution. Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^10 - 1)/2. Wait, hold on. Let me think. If Layer 1 is the innermost, then Layer 9 would be the 9th layer from the inside. So, using the formula, Layer 9 would be (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire computation using the formula. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^10 - 1)/2 ) = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, I think I messed up the place values. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a moment, let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication is accurate. So, I think that's the right answer. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but nested.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Maybe something like a recurrence relation? Let's think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but wait, in our case, a_1 is the first layer, which is 1 + 3. So, actually, maybe a_0 would be 1, but let's check.\n\nWait, let's index the layers properly. If we have Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on. So, in terms of the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer using a different method, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any mistakes I might have made, and both methods gave me the same result, so I feel pretty confident about this.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3. Using a step-by-step approach or recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation both lead to the same result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Correct. Hmm, but wait a minute, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but in my earlier breakdown, I had Layer 9 as the outermost expression. Wait, let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term manually. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply 29524 by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute this step by step. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly.

So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...) and then the outermost 3 times that. So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost 1+3, and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, my initial approach was correct, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost and working outward. Therefore, the final answer should indeed be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Outermost: 3*40 = 120. Let's compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should be correct.
