    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 0 = 0? Wait, no, 3 * 2 (the next digit) is 6, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, let's write it as 29524: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Multiplying each by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in the earlier layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that applies here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me analyze the structure.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nWe can write the recurrence relation as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all layers. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, but in this case, n=9, so:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern, derived a formula, and verified it with both methods. It seems consistent, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula, we find the solution efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Derive the Formula:**\n   The general solution for such a recurrence relation is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   For \\( n = 9 \\), compute \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply \\( L_9 \\) by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, maybe I should do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Let me think. If I expand the expression, each layer adds another term. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, expanding it, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^10. Wait, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand the innermost part first. Let me denote each nested part as follows: Let me define E_k as the expression starting from the kth layer. So, E_1 = 1 + 3\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n...\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\nThen, E = 3*E_9\n\nSo, as before, each E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1=4.\n\nWe can see that E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, as we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to write out the entire expansion, it's like:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is nested. Let me try to see:\n\nEach time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand it, you get 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which becomes 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1.\n\nWait, so maybe E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) is similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each E_k is 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, so E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and as we saw, the solution is E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) \n\nLet me try to compute this step by step again to confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost 1+3: 1+3=4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as each layer adding a power of 3. Since there are nine layers inside, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let me see: If I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1+3s.\n\nWait, actually, each time you go out a layer, you add another power of 3. So, the total would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nIf I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each time you have 1 + 3*(...), which would actually contribute 1 at each layer, multiplied by 3^{n}.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as a geometric series. Let me try.\n\nIf I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers, then the innermost term is 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, E_1=4=3^1 +1? Wait, 3^1 +1=4, yes.\n\nE_2=1 +3*4=13=3^2 + something? 3^2=9, 13-9=4, which is E_1.\n\nWait, perhaps E_k = 3^{k} + E_{k-1}.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a recurrence relation E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1=4, and we've already solved that E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and calculations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation \\(E_k = 1 + 3 \\times E_{k-1}\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 88572, but when I was trying to compute digit by digit, I was confused. So the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly?\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiplied by 3 to get the final result. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the recurrence relation approach also led me to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, and then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The outermost layer is multiplied by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let me add those: 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the final answer will be off. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me recall that for a nested expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it forms a geometric progression. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the general formula for such a nested expression with n layers is: Let me define a recurrence relation where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} for k > 1. Then, the expression we're calculating is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, let's compute a_1 to a_9: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, since each term is a linear recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen, 3 *29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3=0 \u2192 r=3.\n\nSo, homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Next digit: 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, actually, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0.\n\nWait, 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572? Wait, let me check:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carry2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nBut that's tedious. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2*10000 +9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4.\n\nSo 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4.\n\nSo 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer9), so yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost 1+3, which is Layer1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - Layer1 inside is 1+3\n2. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(Layer1)\n3. Then, the next is 1+3*(Layer2)\n... and so on until the outermost.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3: Layer1\n2. Next layer out: 1+3*(Layer1): Layer2\n3. Next: 1+3*(Layer2): Layer3\n4. Next: 1+3*(Layer3): Layer4\n5. Next: 1+3*(Layer4): Layer5\n6. Next: 1+3*(Layer5): Layer6\n7. Next: 1+3*(Layer6): Layer7\n8. Next: 1+3*(Layer7): Layer8\n9. Next: 1+3*(Layer8): Layer9\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, in my initial calculation, I had Layer1 to Layer9, each computed correctly, and then 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3: Layer1\n2. 1+3*(Layer1): Layer2\n3. 1+3*(Layer2): Layer3\n4. 1+3*(Layer3): Layer4\n5. 1+3*(Layer4): Layer5\n6. 1+3*(Layer5): Layer6\n7. 1+3*(Layer6): Layer7\n8. 1+3*(Layer7): Layer8\n9. 1+3*(Layer8): Layer9\n10. 3*(Layer9): total expression.\n\nYes, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, 9 layers computed as above, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again:\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524*3.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step, perhaps using a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1=1+3=4, L_2=1+3*L1, etc.\n\nSo, L1=4\n\nL2=1+3*4=13\n\nL3=1+3*13=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*L9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see:\n\nEach L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply initial condition L1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1: L1= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2=4.\n\nThus, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times this outermost layer. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is a solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined by the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) equals 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to Layer 9, which results in 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So adding the carries: 12: 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer wraps that. Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting with the innermost, which is 1+3. Then moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers. Wait, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3. So, yes, 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me do that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to verify. So, 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428, so 90000-1428=88572. So that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Maybe I should verify each step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I compute 3*29524, let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, so writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit positions: 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten thousands), 9 (hundred thousands), 5 (millions), 2 (ten millions), 9 (hundred millions), 2 (billions).\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. It looks like L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u2192 r = 3\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check 3^10. 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so if I consider each term as a geometric series, maybe I can find a closed-form expression without computing each layer.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for L_n, which gives me L_9 = 29524, and then multiply by 3, I think that's the most efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, let me think again about the layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, the expression for L_n is indeed a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, plus some constants.\n\nBut since I already derived the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which works for n=1 to 9, I can trust that L_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds. For example, if I have only 1 layer, then the expression would be 3*(1+3) = 3*4=12. Using the formula, L1=4, so 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nIf I have 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39. Using the formula, L2=13, so 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120. Using the formula, L3=40, so 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold for smaller cases, so I can be confident it works for 9 layers as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the problem. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost one.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can compute each term up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Wait, but in our earlier computation, we had Layer 1 as 4, which is a_1, and Layer 9 as a_9 = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can set up the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the recursive approach seems more straightforward. Another way to verify is to compute each layer again, just to be sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me go through the layers once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no, actually, the outermost is layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1: 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this. Let's denote a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3=4. Then, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me set a_n = A. Then, A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2= 3C => 9/2=3C => C= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

Let's recompute each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this differently. 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it before, I thought I might have made a mistake, but now it's consistent. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me check each layer once again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the recurrence relation**: Recognize the pattern \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). The closed-form solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n=9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, yes. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since there are 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. If I expand it all the way, it's like a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another power of 3. So, expanding the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this all the way, how many terms would there be? There are 9 layers, so when expanded, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)...)). Let me try to write out the expansion step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me expand the innermost part first: The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, finally, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, the total expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, but I need to adjust for the coefficients. Wait, let me think about it. If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand all the parentheses, it would be 3*(1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3^8*1). So, that's 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in this case, n=8, so sum = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy. Wait, no, actually, let me check. Wait, if I expand the entire expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3^k term. So, for 9 layers, the sum would be from k=0 to k=8, which is 9 terms. So, the sum is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But wait, earlier, I got E = 88572, which is 3*(29524). So, where is the mistake here? Let me check. Wait, perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, when expanded, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*previous. So, when I expand all the way, the total sum is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Because each time you go out a layer, you multiply by another 3. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But wait, earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I got E = 88572, which is 3*29524. So, there's a conflict here. That suggests that one of my methods is wrong. Let me see. Wait, when I computed each layer step by step, I got a_9 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. But when I thought of it as a geometric series, I got E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523. These two results are different, which means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the step-by-step computation again. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then E = 3*29524 = 88572. Now, when I think of it as a geometric series, I get E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = 3*(19683 -1)/2 = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step, E = 88572. There's a discrepancy. Let me see where I might have gone wrong. Wait, perhaps the geometric series approach is not correctly accounting for the layers. Let me try to see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, each time I have 1 + 3*(...), which when multiplied by 3, gives 3 + 3^2*(...). So, expanding all the way, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but that would be sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k. Which is (3^{10} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, (59049 -3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. So, E = 29523. But according to the step-by-step, E = 88572. That suggests that the geometric series approach is correct, and the step-by-step is wrong. Wait, but I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step. Let me check again. Let me compute each layer again carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then E=3*29524=88572. But according to the geometric series, E=29523. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps the step-by-step is correct, and the geometric series approach is missing something. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. So, that would be 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but that's the same as sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -3)/2 = 29523. But in the step-by-step, I got E=88572, which is 3*29524. So, where is the disconnect? Let me compute 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 )=3*(19683 -1)/2=3*9841=29523. Alternatively, if I think of the expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), that would be 3*(1 +3 +9 +...+6561)=3*(9841)=29523. But according to the step-by-step, it's 88572. So, which is it? Let me compute the step-by-step again. Layer1:4 Layer2:13 Layer3:40 Layer4:121 Layer5:364 Layer6:1093 Layer7:3280 Layer8:9841 Layer9:29524 E=3*29524=88572. So, according to the step-by-step, E=88572. According to the geometric series, E=29523. There's a factor of 3 difference. Wait, perhaps the geometric series approach is considering the sum without the outermost multiplication by 3. Let me clarify. The expression is E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). So, if I let S = 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), then E=3*S. But S itself is 1 +3*S'. Where S' is the next layer. Wait, but in the end, S = 1 +3*S1, where S1 is the next layer, and so on. So, actually, S is the sum we're calculating, which is a_9=29524. Therefore, E=3*S=3*29524=88572. So, the geometric series approach was mistakenly considering S as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841, but in reality, S is a_9=29524, which is 1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=29524. Therefore, the correct approach is the step-by-step, leading to E=88572. The mistake in the geometric series approach was that I was considering the sum S as the sum of 3^k from k=0 to 8, but in reality, S is not that sum. Instead, S is the result of the nested expression, which is a_9=29524, which is 1 +3*a_8, and so on. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. To confirm, let me compute the sum step by step: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Maybe 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where i goes from 1 to 9. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{i} = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_i. The recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer i, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. i=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. i=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was working through it step by step, the initial method was effective. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a2. And so on up to a9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2. So, 3C - 1/2 =4 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2= (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3= (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9= (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=59049/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outer expression is 3*a9, and a9=29524, so 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me verify my computations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. The expression seems to be of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, it's a nested expression with 9 layers. Let me denote the innermost term as a base case and see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth layer. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write this recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Now, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a few layers again to see if the pattern holds. Let's see: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. Wait, no, actually, L(1) is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. So yes, the recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the values. For n=1: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0: Hmm, but n starts at 1, so maybe I need another approach. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have. For n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could express the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(L(9)) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive formula, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because it's easy to make an arithmetic error in each layer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be expressed in terms of a_{n-1}. This seems like a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which corresponds to the innermost layer. Wait, let me see: when n=1, a_1=4. So, plugging into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2, as I saw earlier.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, so I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is computed as such. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. That seems consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved. But the recursive approach seems straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n- Repeat this 9 times, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\n- Alternatively, use the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, plug in n=9, get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nEither way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, we find each subsequent value and multiply by 3 at the end. Using a recursive formula confirms the result, leading to the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. The next digit is 9, which is the ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. The next digit is 2 (ten-thousands place? Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 2 is 8, so write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall: For a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, and b = 1. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (1)*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our first layer is L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, where L_0 would be the innermost term before that. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the indices. Let me think again. If I consider L_1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then L_1 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, to solve this recurrence, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually, which is much more efficient. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure consistency. Let's take n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches what I got earlier. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we determine each layer's value efficiently. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula for the nth layer, we find the outermost layer's value and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Recursive formula**: For each layer \\(L_n\\), \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General solution**: The nth layer can be computed using \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the outermost layer**: Since there are 9 layers, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

However, when I did the digit-wise multiplication earlier, I thought I got 87572, but now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me check the layer computations again to see if I made a mistake there.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * 29524, which we computed as 88572 using the addition method, but earlier I thought digit-wise multiplication gave me 87572, which must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misaligned the digits in the digit-wise multiplication. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the digits are 8 (ten thousands place), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572, but that contradicts the addition method which gave 88572.\n\nWait, I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\nFirst, write down 29524.\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carryover\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in the addition method.\n\nWait, let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524 again.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding the units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n\nTen thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carryover 1\n\nTen thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's correct. So why does the digit-wise multiplication give me 87572?\n\nI must have misaligned the digits in the multiplication. Let me try writing it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit is 8\n\nSo the digits are:\n\n8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572, not 87572. I think I wrote it wrong earlier. So the correct result is 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So the digit-wise multiplication should also give 88572.\n\nWait, so in my earlier digit-wise multiplication, I must have written the digits incorrectly. Let me correct that.\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten thousands: 8\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost one, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 6 * 2 = 12? Wait, no, let me do it step by step. Wait, perhaps I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

Wait, but let me check that again because when I did it step by step earlier, I thought maybe 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me make sure that was correct. Let me go back through each layer to check for any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I feel like that might not be the case because sometimes when you have these nested expressions, there's a pattern or formula you can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think if there's a better way.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, L_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1 into L_n: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as before.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3*(...), where the ... is L_9. So yes, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but 29524 only has 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, the digits are:\n\n- 2 (ten thousands place)\n- 9 (thousands place)\n- 5 (hundreds place)\n- 2 (tens place)\n- 4 (units place)\n\nSo, multiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check with a calculator approach: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 40000 + 40000 = 80000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. Wait, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding them together: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, 58000 + 1000 = 59000, 59000 + 40 = 59040, 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524. Let's do this step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 20 = 88568, 88568 + 4 = 88572. Okay, so that confirms it: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2705\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2705\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2705\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2705\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2705\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2705\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2705\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2705\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2705\n\nYes, each step checks out.

So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. So, starting from the innermost Layer 1, each subsequent layer built on the previous one. After computing up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Sometimes, when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which can throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it aligns with the result I got. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on, as I calculated earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that also gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
