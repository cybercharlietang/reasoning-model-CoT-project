    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to compute each step starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that 4. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, the next layer is 1 + 12, which is 13. Let me write that down step by step. Maybe I should create a table or something to keep track of each layer as I compute them. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as the problem is written with nine such expressions. So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the next step is to multiply that by 3. But wait, no, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1: 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000=87000\n\n87000 + 1500=88500\n\n88500 + 60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because sometimes when I break it down, I might make an error.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that's 87572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572, right? Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again each step because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, each step is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually seems manageable.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 +1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 +1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 +1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 +1\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is of the form a*r^n + b, where r is the common ratio, which in this case is 3.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2= 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if we wanted to compute it without computing each layer, we could use the formula for Layer 9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, either way is fine. But since I already computed each layer step by step, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, it's a finite series with 9 layers, so the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I think the way I did it before is more straightforward.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps:\n\n1. Identify the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n4. After computing Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing the innermost nine layers, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " and so on up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, maybe I should work from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time substituting the value into the next layer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1, so Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1, so Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1, so Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let's calculate that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1, so Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted or made an error in substitution. Let's go through each layer again quickly to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out, so I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this.\n\nThe general form is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572, as computed.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yes, that's consistent with our earlier result.\n\nSo, this gives me confidence that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n2. After computing each layer, I noticed a pattern that could be represented by a recurrence relation.\n\n3. Solved the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which confirmed the step-by-step computations.\n\n4. Alternatively, recognized that the entire expression could be represented in terms of 3^{11} minus a small number, leading to the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), which can be represented by a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, confirming the step-by-step computation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost layer. Then each time we go out, we add another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, let's count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1 + 3 2. 1 + 3(...) 3. 1 + 3(...) 4. 1 + 3(...) 5. 1 + 3(...) 6. 1 + 3(...) 7. 1 + 3(...) 8. 1 + 3(...) 9. 1 + 3(...) So, I think there are 9 layers here, each with a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3. Let me compute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Now, moving to layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So layer 2 is 13. Now, layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3(...)), where the inner part is layer 9. So, compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in the calculations. Let me double-check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute this again because 9841 is a larger number. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's try to find A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nAlso, for n=0, but wait, n starts at 1 here, so maybe we can use another approach. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1.\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10.\n\nYes, 3^10 is 59049, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step calculation.\n\nI think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer.\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3(...) occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of times 1+3 is enclosed in parentheses is 9 times. So, layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, layer 2 is the next, up to layer 9, which is the one just inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the outermost 3 multiplies layer 9.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, which we accounted for in our calculation.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, let me check how many layers I have.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) before the outermost 3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Because each (1+3 is a new layer, and the outermost is 3(...). Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if I have 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, each being 1+3*S_i, and then the outermost is 3*S_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to S9, which was 29524, and then the outermost is 3*S9, which would be 3*29524. Wait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to S9 as 29524, but the original expression is 3*(S9). So, perhaps my initial approach was a bit off.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try again. Let me write down the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after Step 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so after computing all the inner steps up to 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of 1+3 before the outermost 3(...).\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, each layer wraps around that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times '1+3(' appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3 is a new layer, and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is (1+3(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because after the first 3(...), there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of times (1+3 appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1+3 is after the first 3, then each subsequent (1+3 is nested inside.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3 is the innermost: 1+3.\n\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3*(innermost), which is (1+3(1+3)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have 1+3*(...). Each time we have a new 1+3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1) =13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(Layer3)=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(Layer4)=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(Layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(Layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(Layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(Layer8)=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total number of layers is 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer), and then the outermost is 3 times that.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as S_n, where S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, S_1 is 1+3=4, then S_2=1+3*S1=13, etc.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for S_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution S_n^(p) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, S_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nS_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*S_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute a much larger number of layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me do that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me verify that because 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

Now, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nSo, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 12 = 13.

So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280)\n\nLayer 8:\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9 (the outermost layer): 1 + 3*(9841)\n\nLayer 9:\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that's the result of the innermost expression. But the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nSo, the total expression would be:\n\n3*(29524) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572?

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but that seems like a huge number. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, I think I did nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*previous. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3=1+3*13=40, Layer4=1+3*40=121, Layer5=1+3*121=364, Layer6=1+3*364=1093, Layer7=1+3*1093=3280, Layer8=1+3*3280=9841, Layer9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nLet me test with a smaller version. Suppose I have just 3(1 + 3). That would be 3*(4)=12. Let's compute using the layer method:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nTotal expression: 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nNow, with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nTotal expression: 3*13=39\n\nLet me compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nOuter layer: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nTotal expression: 3*40=120\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))=3(1 + 3*13)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds for smaller numbers. Therefore, it's likely correct for nine layers as well. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again for the layers to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. Each step seems correct, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nI wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but since the problem only requires computing it for n=9, it's probably easier to compute each layer step by step as I did.\n\nBut just for fun, let me try to find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works for these values. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the Layer9 result I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, but since I had nine layers, it's a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have tried to compute each layer step by step, which I did, and arrived at the same answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let's try computing each layer and see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me avoid computing each one manually, which might take a long time.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524, correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. The initial term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, 3^10 is 59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 minus 1 is 59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 29,524 multiplied by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that again step by step. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the formula holds. Let's compute layer 5 using the formula. a_5 = (3^{6} -1)/2. 3^6 is 729. So, 729 -1=728; 728/2=364. Which matches what I had earlier. So, the formula works. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning or calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should compute each step step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Let me keep going step by step. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Moving another layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Now, moving to the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them all together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the final result is 265,719. Wait, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me just verify one or two steps to be sure. For example, when I computed 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. That's correct. Another step: 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Then, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Then, 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. So, 27000+2400=29400 +123=29523. 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 4*3=12. Wait, but I think I wrote 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 70 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*4=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +210=88710, +12=88722. Wait, that doesn't match my previous result of 88573. Did I make a mistake here? Oh no, I think I messed up the breakdown. Let me correct that. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right? Because 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3*29524 would be 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24). So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Then, 1 + 88572=88573. That matches my previous step. So, that was correct. Then, moving on: 3*88573. Let me compute that again to be sure. 88573 * 3. Let's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now, adding them up: 240000 + 24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 265,719. I think that's accurate. I went through each step carefully, making sure each multiplication and addition was correct. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helped prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps because that could throw off the final answer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series, but each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, we can solve the equation C = 1 + 3*C, which gives C = 1/(3 -1) = 1/2.\n\nWait, that might not be right because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 =3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in calculating 3^10.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct because 3^10 is known to be 59049.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29,524\n\n*       3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, multiply this result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer: Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each layer is following a recursive formula: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence to find a general formula for L_n, which would make computing the layers faster, especially if there are many layers.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, we can compute L_9 directly as (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nI think this is correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Computed each layer step by step, labeling them L1 to L9.\n3. Noticing a pattern, derived a recurrence relation and solved it to find a general formula for each layer.\n4. Verified the formula with the first few layers to ensure accuracy.\n5. Applied the formula to find L9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n6. Cross-checked using an alternative method to confirm the result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step and recognizing a pattern, we derive a formula to find the value efficiently. The final result is computed as follows:\n\n1. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\).\n2. Solving the recurrence gives \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. For the outermost layer \\( L_9 \\), compute \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. Multiply by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the innermost layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). Since the innermost layer is 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer is 13.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Fourth layer is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer is 364.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression has 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, after computing all the layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3. Let me make sure I got that right. The entire expression is 3*(all those layers). So, if the ninth layer is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit unsure because 88572 is a large number, and I want to make sure each step is accurate.\n\nLet me try computing the layers again, but perhaps using a different method. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nLet's compute f(1) through f(9):\n\nf(1) = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I had before. Therefore, f(9) is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think about this another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is defined recursively as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, which in this case is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. The solution to such a recurrence is f(n) = (f(1) - c)*a^{n-1} + c, where c is the constant term in the recurrence divided by (a - 1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nFor a linear recurrence of the form f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, the solution is f(n) = a^{n-1}*(f(1) - (b/(a-1))) + (b/(a-1)). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, in this case, a = 3, b = 1. Therefore, the solution would be f(n) = 3^{n-1}*(f(1) - (1/(3-1))) + (1/(3-1)).\n\nSimplify that: f(n) = 3^{n-1}*(4 - 1/2) + 1/2 = 3^{n-1}*(7/2) + 1/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nLet me compute f(9) using this formula:\n\nf(9) = (7/2)*3^{8} + 1/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, f(9) = (7/2)*6561 + 1/2.\n\nCompute (7/2)*6561: 7*6561 = 45927; 45927/2 = 22963.5.\n\nThen, add 1/2: 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964.\n\nWait, that's different from the 29524 I got earlier. That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my formula.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the formula again. The general solution for f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b is f(n) = a^{n}*(f(0)) + b*(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + ... + a^0). But maybe I messed up the initial conditions.\n\nWait, in my problem, f(1) = 4, not f(0). So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLet me rederive the solution for f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1 with f(1) = 4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: f_p = 3*f_p + 1.\n\nSolving for f_p: f_p - 3*f_p = 1 => -2*f_p = 1 => f_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nAh, that matches my earlier result. So, f(9) is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the other formula, I got 22964, which was incorrect. So, the correct formula is f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, leading to f(9)=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524*3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n24*3=72.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recursive formula, and then multiplying by 3, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move outward and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The result of the innermost expression is 29524. Now, multiply this result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that:\n\nTotal expression: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first innermost. Then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we add another 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because each layer adds one more 3(...). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation of each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a formula for such a nested expression? Maybe a geometric series or something? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which seems recursive. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=9 is correct. Because in the problem, the innermost is (1+3), which is a_1=4. Then each layer adds another 3*(...), so after 9 layers, we have a_9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost and building up, which is exactly what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach, but I think the way I did it is correct. Let me see if I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, but maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) as 3*1 + 3*3*(...), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each layer using more precise calculations to avoid any mistakes.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the total expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied.\n\nBut I think the step-by-step approach is solid because each layer builds on the previous one, and I've double-checked the calculations using the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result for Layer 9, so multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by expanding it, but that might be too cumbersome given the number of layers. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer in reverse, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the value using the formula I derived.\n\nSince the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and double-checking the final multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " I might need to compute each layer step by step because each result is used in the next layer. Let me try computing each layer one by one. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let's see, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let's compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, we need to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Maybe it's better to compute each step step by step. Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). So, substituting the innermost result: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*(result from previous layer)). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I take the result from the previous layer, multiply it by 3, and add 1. Let me try to do this step by step for each layer.\n\nLet me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing the innermost layers up to the ninth layer, which gives me 29524, I then have to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Each time I computed a layer, I took the previous result, multiplied by 3, then added 1. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correct, and the final result before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Then, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 \u00d7 3 seems a bit high. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3\n= (20,000 \u00d7 3) + (9,000 \u00d7 3) + (500 \u00d7 3) + (20 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u00d7 3)\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 88,572 is the final result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the way I approached it was correct: compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, then moving outward, each time substituting the result into the next layer. Then, after getting the value of the innermost expression up to the ninth layer, I multiplied it by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern?\n\nHmm, let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nYes, this formula seems to hold. So, for a_n, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same answer I got before. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nEach time, we're doing 1 + 3*(something). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's a sum of terms where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to n, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, no, because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's more like a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but each term is added inside the next multiplication. So, perhaps the sum is something like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, if I consider the expression inside out, the total expression would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to 9 times. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), so it's 3 times the sum, which itself is 1 + 3*(another sum), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series would help here.\n\nThe sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's exactly the formula we derived earlier for a_n. So, in our case, a_n = S where S is the sum up to 3^{n}.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step once more.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each step follows logically, and the calculations are correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers up to the ninth layer, we get the result 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

That's simple, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2).

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times... ))). So each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3. So, when I compute up to Step 9, that's the innermost part, and then the outermost 3 would multiply that result.

So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but the way it's written, each time we have \"1 + 3(\" followed by another expression, so each layer is a new \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Let me try to compute each step carefully, making sure I don't miscount.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.

Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))).\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which we computed as 4. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression is 29524, as computed above. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm how many layers we have. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is the value of the innermost expression. Then, the next layer out would be 3*(29524), but wait, no, because each layer is \"1 + 3*(previous layer)\". Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))), so the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, after 9 layers, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: If I have 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", each layer is one more step. So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1), then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the total expression would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted the layers correctly. Because sometimes it's easy to miscount the number of layers, especially with nested expressions.\n\nLet me recount the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have \"1 + 3(\", which is the start of the first inner layer.\n2. Then, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 gives us 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations for each layer. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWait, hold on, 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so total is 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 3,279 + 1 = 3,280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 9,840 + 1 = 9,841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,841*3: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523; total is 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 29,523 + 1 = 29,524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just verify the multiplication for 3*29,524.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I went through each layer carefully, making sure each step was correct, and verified the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each step outward:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try computing each one.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving outward, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me double-check that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me check that again. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait a second, is that right? 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, that's a big number. Let me verify: 3*3280 is indeed 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, is that right? 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Let me check the multiplication for Layer 9 again: 9841*3.\n\n9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nNo more digits, so 27... Wait, maybe I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I found a formula that allowed me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would have been time-consuming and prone to error. This approach seems solid, and both methods agree, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. The recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: The very last part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another expression where it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer).\n\nSo, second layer: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThird layer: Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result from second layer). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nFourth layer: Next, 1 + 3*(result from third layer) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(result from fourth layer) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Yes, 363. So, 1 + 363 is indeed 364.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(result from fifth layer) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(result from sixth layer) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(result from seventh layer) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(result from eighth layer) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nWait, but that's the ninth layer, right? Let me check how many layers I have. Starting from the innermost, I had nine layers, each time going out one. So, after computing the ninth layer, that should be the result inside the outermost 3(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(ninth layer result), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Let's see: 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication for 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers, maybe there's a geometric series or something similar here.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I obtained earlier for the ninth layer. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I also arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that applies here. However, since each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's reminiscent of how numbers are represented in base 3, but I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I have a number in base 3, each digit represents a coefficient multiplied by 3^k. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a number digit by digit in base 3, where each digit is 1. So, if I have nine layers, each contributing a 1 in base 3, the number would be 111111111 in base 3, which is equal to (3^9 - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly what we have here.\n\nWait, let's see: 111111111 in base 3 is equal to 1*3^8 + 1*3^7 + ... + 1*3^0. Which is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's not matching our a_9 value, which was 29524. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, in our problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a number where each digit is 1, but each time we're scaling up by 3 and adding 1. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Hmm, perhaps it's a different scaling.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach since that gave me a clear formula and confirmed the result.\n\nSo, to recap, each layer adds another 3*(previous) + 1, and after nine layers, we get a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it using two methods: step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation formula. Both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) step by step again, but this time using the formula.\n\nWait, but I already did that. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm good.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can compute this using exponents. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and we have nine layers, maybe it's similar to 3^10 - something.\n\nWait, from the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be written as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nIf I expand a_1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na_3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Wait, 1 + 3 is 4, plus 9 is 13, plus 27 is 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, that's the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, which would correspond to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n, and the outermost multiplication by 3 gives the final result.\n\nI think I'm thoroughly convinced that the answer is 88572. I've checked it multiple ways, and each method confirms the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Second layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Third layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Fourth layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Fifth layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Sixth layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Seventh layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Eighth layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Ninth layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each part step by step. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result of the innermost computation). Wait, no. Let me check: the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing all the inner layers, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I'll end up with the final result. Let me list these computations step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this entire nested expression. So, the last step I did was computing the innermost layer, and then each subsequent layer up to the 9th layer, which gave me 88573. But wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost expression and moving outward, the final value before the outermost 3 is 88573. So, the entire expression is 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let me break it down: 88,573 * 3. 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, write down 1 and carry over 2. 3*5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 3*8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2. 3*8 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So, writing it all together: 265,719. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's 4. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me list each step clearly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get 29524, but I think I might have miscounted because the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of 1+3(...). So, each time we go one layer out, we compute 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that accurately:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 265,719, which was incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers. So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to Layer 10 as 88573, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, I think I added an extra layer mistakenly.\n\nSo, let me recount properly.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is 4.\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count each layer correctly:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we reach 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n(2*3)=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n(2*3)=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, each time we have a new layer, starting from 1+3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, after computing 9 layers, we get 29524, then 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nBut let me confirm this with another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time we compute 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = D.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3*29524 is 88,572, but let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it now. So, the step-by-step computation is as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous result):\n\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of the 9th layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each step, I multiply the previous result by 3 and add 1.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier because if any layer is wrong, the subsequent ones will be off.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen each (1 + 3(...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2014 Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3(...)), so up to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 1\n2. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 2\n3. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 3\n4. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 4\n5. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 5\n6. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 6\n7. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 7\n8. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 8\n9. 1+3( \u2014 Layer 9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, my initial counting was correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I compute Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me double-check that step because sometimes when you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it another way:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try computing the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? Because each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n and then compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4).\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up: 60000+27000=87000\n\n87000+1500=88500\n\n88500+60=88560\n\n88560+12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each step carefully, double-checked each layer, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms that the innermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in 13 for Layer 2:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, Layer 3 is 40. Moving outward, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Continuing outward:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times this entire nested expression. So, after computing all the layers, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error with larger numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any of the intermediate steps. It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, which matches the original expression. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but the original problem was 3 times the entire expression. Let me confirm that. The expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested 1 + 3*(...) terms. So, yes, after computing the innermost to the outermost, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3, giving 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). When expanded, it's a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to see what the expansion would look like.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Wait, but in the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, it's 3*(...), where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1s. Each time we have a 1, and then a 3 times the next layer. Since there are nine layers, each with a 1, that's nine 1s, and each 3 is multiplied by the next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me see if I can express this as a sum.\n\nIf I expand E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as we did before, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nBut when we expand E, it's 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBut perhaps another way to think about it is to see how many terms there are when fully expanded. Each time we have a 1 multiplied by some power of 3.\n\nWait, let me try expanding E without substituting the layers. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand E completely, it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, each time you have a 1, and each 3 is multiplied by the next layer. So, the expansion would be a sum of 3^k for k from 1 to 10, but perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, let me see. If I have E =3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and each inner expression is similar, then E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nBut from the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nThat's another way to confirm the result.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by 1 + 3*(previous layer). After nine layers, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we find that E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move outward to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The value of the entire nested expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiply this result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: the very last part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, Layer 2 would be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, Layer 3 would be:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let me compute this carefully. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is:\n\nFinal result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: \n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3 seems like a big number, but let's verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Maybe I should double-check each layer computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that expressions like these can sometimes be represented using a formula. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and assuming the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. We know that a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. So, layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. I think this confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have given me the same result. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same answer, which adds confidence in the solution.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to find the value of each layer, leading us to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the outermost multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Formula verification**: Recognizing the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find the general solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for n=9 confirms Layer 9 is 29524, leading to the same final result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each step as I go inwards. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that. So, 3*(4) is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each multiplied by 3 at the end. Hmm, actually, when I started, I thought the innermost was Layer 1, but the way the problem is written, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is built on top of that. So, the outermost layer would be Layer 9. But in the problem, after the innermost, each is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the way I computed it, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, looking back, the problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, if I compute the inner expression as Layer 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let's compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I think I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count too many.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1: 4\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the original problem has exactly 9 layers. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3: that's the first layer.\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a ( after 3, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, counting from the first ( to the last, there are 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost, which is 4, and then each layer builds up to Layer 1 being the outermost. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, actually, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). So, in the expression, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). So, when I start computing, I should start from that innermost one and work my way out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the layers can be a bit tricky. Let me try to write down each step clearly to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, f(9) is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check f(9) again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So, f(9) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is defined by f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for f(n).\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: iterative computation and closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to be absolutely certain. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the form of a geometric series. So, f(n) can be seen as the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's a recurrence, the closed-form is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all 9 layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, actually, the problem has 9 layers of nesting. Let me confirm: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, let me compute each step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is... Hmm, let me compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after checking each step, I feel confident that the final result is indeed 88572. I think that's the answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it without getting lost.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " I think this might get too confusing with labels. Maybe I should just compute each innermost part first and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we're at 40. Let me check if I'm doing this right. Each time, I take the result from the inner layer, multiply it by 3, and add 1. So, if I keep doing this, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's go through each step again to be thorough. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot of layers. Let me count them again. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Each time I add a layer, I'm moving one step out. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s before each 1: There are nine 3s, each multiplying a nested expression. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s: 3(...), then another 3(...), etc. From the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers are 9, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nWait, so 29524*3=88572.\n\nBut let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought there were nine layers, but when I counted the number of 3s, I thought maybe it was nine layers. But let me confirm the number of layers again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 layer1\n\n2. 1 + 3*(layer1) \u2192 layer2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(layer2) \u2192 layer3\n\n4. 1 + 3*(layer3) \u2192 layer4\n\n5. 1 + 3*(layer4) \u2192 layer5\n\n6. 1 + 3*(layer5) \u2192 layer6\n\n7. 1 + 3*(layer6) \u2192 layer7\n\n8. 1 + 3*(layer7) \u2192 layer8\n\n9. 1 + 3*(layer8) \u2192 layer9\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, total layers from innermost to outermost are 9, plus the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, that's correct. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4.\n\nWait, but when I did the layers, I ended up with layer9 as 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I can find a pattern or formula for this, instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe solution for L_n is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c, where c is a constant, but I might be mixing up the exact formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. For a recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution can be found as L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, let's consider that the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nSo, K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my earlier step-by-step computation. Each layer seems to be correct, and the formula also gives the same result, so I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if I get the same numbers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula helped solidify the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should actually compute each step as I go. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, the third layer is 40. Hmm, this seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me continue this process step by step.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me check my calculations so far:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nYes, that seems correct so far. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me keep going.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to be sure.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and there are nine of those.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I had the innermost as 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I did nine layers, ending up with 29524. But let me check again because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, yes, nine layers. Therefore, when I computed up to the ninth layer, I ended up with 29524. But wait, that seems very large. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me compute each step again carefully:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the ninth layer is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that ninth layer, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost is 3*(...). The innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is nine, and the outermost is 3 times the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so after computing the ninth layer as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 3*29524 = 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total expression is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me double-check because sometimes when you count layers, it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer: 1 + 3(\n- The second: 1 + 3(\n- And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Therefore, the outermost is 3 times the ninth layer, which is 29524, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for it. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which resembles a geometric progression.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3^{10} is indeed 59,049. Yes, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a_1 = 4, then indeed a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started computing manually, I thought the outermost expression was 3*(...), so the ninth layer is inside that 3 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I consider the innermost as 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is nine, so the outermost is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524, giving 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, after nine layers, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers inside.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with eight layers inside, but no, I think it's nine layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) inside the outermost 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, inside the first 3, there are nine 1 + 3(...) layers, each nested inside the previous.\n\nSo, yes, a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as a sum:\n\nThe expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, it's straightforward.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can also compute the sum using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the expression using the formula without computing each layer.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, that's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, that would be Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply this by 3. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each layer gets computed step by step, and finally, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recalculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524.

Wait, maybe I should write it out properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but when I did it before, I thought 29524*3=88572, which is correct. Wait, but when I broke it down earlier, I had 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12, and then added all those together: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, both methods give the same result, 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88572 as well. So, that seems consistent. So, I think my final answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recursive formula seems like it could be modeled by a geometric series or some exponential growth. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I need to go up to Layer 9 since there are nine sets. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3 is 40. Moving on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Next.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Continuing.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Next layer.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Hmm, let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Moving on.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's break it down. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute this step by step. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Let's add these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Maybe I should verify each layer's computation to ensure that I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the result. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric progression. Let me try that approach as well.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Expanding this, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, after k steps:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{k-1} + 3^k*a_{n - k}\n\nIf we expand all the way to a_1, which is 4, we can write:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1\n\nSince a_1 = 4, this becomes:\n\na_n = (3^n - 1)/ (3 - 1) + 3^n*4\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with ratio 3, so the sum is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nThen, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*4.\n\nWait, that seems different from the previous result. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me try expanding a few layers to see.\n\nFor example, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, so each a_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but for a_2, it's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40.\n\nWait, but according to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for a_2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 would be (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. So yes, that formula holds.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms my previous calculations. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm certain that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression. We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but the entire original expression is 3 times this result, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing all the layers, we have 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 88573 * 3: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, the total is 265,719.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a big number.

Let me check the multiplication steps again because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCompute 3*88573:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3 * 80,000 = 240,000\n\n3 * 8,000 = 24,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 70 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total is 265,719.\n\nBut let me think again: each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each step is following the pattern of 3n + 1, where n is the previous result.\n\nWait, that's an interesting observation. So, each layer is of the form 3n + 1, starting from n=4. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*a1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\na3 = 3*a2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\na4 = 3*a3 + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\na5 = 3*a4 + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\na6 = 3*a5 + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\na7 = 3*a6 + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\na8 = 3*a7 + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\na9 = 3*a8 + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nThen, the next term is a10 = 3*a9 + 1 = 3*29524 + 1 = 88573\n\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence relation is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} + c/(k-1)\n\nLet me verify this formula. For n=1, a1 = (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{0} + 1/(3-1) = (4 - 0.5)*1 + 0.5 = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2, a2 = (4 - 0.5)*3^{1} + 0.5 = 3.5*3 + 0.5 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had a2=13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The general solution for a linear recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * k^{n - 1} - (c)/(k - 1)\n\nWait, maybe I had the formula wrong. Let me derive it.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nn=10: a10=(3^{11} -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 10th term, a10, is 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a10 = 3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*88573 step by step:\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9, write down 9.\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 88573 has 5 digits: 8,8,5,7,3.\n\nWait, let me do it properly:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo, it's 265,719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the 10th term is 88573. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": "Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. Hmm, so far, the pattern seems to be that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me continue this way step by step.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, so the innermost parentheses was layer 1: 4, and each subsequent layer built upon that. So, the ninth layer is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing all nine layers, which gave me 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- There's no more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up any layer, the final result will be wrong.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, leading to 29524 at layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, we multiply that by 3, which gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times that entire expression, which is 3*(...). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the value inside the parentheses is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " I think I get the idea. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try computing each layer starting from the innermost one.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, the pattern is each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. That seems like a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I think the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so maybe instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula directly. But since I was unsure at first, I did each layer manually, which is good because it helped me see the pattern and then apply the formula.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the exponentiation or division.\n\n3^10: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)=59048. 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute this as 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the correct answer. It's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. It's easy to get lost or make a multiplication error, but by breaking it down and checking each layer, I can be more confident in the result.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and applying the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence relation saved time in the end, but even if I didn't remember the formula, computing each layer step by step worked just fine.\n\nIn summary, the key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer one by one, then applying the multiplication by 3 at the end. This systematic approach helped manage the complexity of the problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\). \n\nThe innermost layer is computed as:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, each subsequent layer is calculated, leading to:\n- Layer 9: \\(\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives the result:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Maybe I need to compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Let's compute that:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, Layer 5 is 364. Let's go to Layer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, the total expression would be:\n\n3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify the multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps. It's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572 is the final answer. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when we compute 3*(Layer 9), that's correct because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nLet me try another approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer seems to be multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nThis resembles a nested geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can express this recursively.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nCalculate units digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " I think I get the idea. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1, we get 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1, we get 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1, we get 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1, we get 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500*3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20*3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4*3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. Then, 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with so many layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series, but I'm not sure exactly. Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, but actually, in the problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, so maybe L_1 is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if that's correct. So, for n=1, L_1=4. For n=2, L_2=1 + 3*4=13. For n=3, L_3=1 + 3*13=40. Yep, that's the same as what I calculated earlier. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nNow, maybe we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_h + L_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the 9th layer is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result without having to compute each layer manually. That's a neat approach and probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since this problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. However, knowing the formula is useful for future reference.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm applying the formula correctly. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, which correspond to n=9 layers. So, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct because each layer adds one more exponent. So, starting from L_1, which is 3^2, then L_2 is 3^3, and so on up to L_9 being 3^{10}. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked everything, and all the steps seem correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression and multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers. So, L1 is the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on until L9. Finally, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, I need to compute L1 through L9 step by step. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2:\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3:\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me check my calculations so far. L1 is 4, correct. Then L2 is 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12 = 13, that's right. Then L3 is 1 + 3*13, which is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, seems correct.\n\nProceeding to L4:\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWow, that's growing quickly. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or maybe a formula instead of computing each step manually, because doing this nine times might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each Lk is defined as Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nWait, 364? Let me check that again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so L9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9. Because each step depends on the previous one, a small error could propagate. Let me recompute L3 to L9 step by step, just to verify.\n\nStarting over:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, L9 is indeed 29524.\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute this again to double-check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, the leading 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nPutting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving Lk - 3*Lk-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Lk = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works.\n\nFor k=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key was recognizing the recursive pattern and then finding a closed-form formula to compute L9 directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which would be tedious and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Using the formula, it's much more efficient and accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have continued computing each Lk step by step until L9, but it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. The formula approach seems more reliable here.\n\nLet me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and define each layer Lk as 1 + 3*Lk-1, starting from L1=4.\n\n2. Compute each Lk step by step up to L9.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for Lk using the method for solving linear recurrence relations.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute L9 directly.\n\n5. Multiply L9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis seems thorough. I don't think I've missed anything. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a recursive pattern and derive a formula to compute the result efficiently.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_k \\) as \\( L_k = 1 + 3 \\times L_{k-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the sequence, we find:\n\n\\( L_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( k = 9 \\):\n\n\\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in 13:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3):\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Layer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524*3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 5, 7, 2, and the last digit was 2? Wait, maybe I messed up the places. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n9*3 = 27. Write 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous result. Earlier, I thought it was 88572, but now it's 87572. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me check both methods.\n\nFirst method: 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, adding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nBut when I did the direct multiplication, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the direct multiplication. Let me do it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut according to the first method, it's 88572. There's a difference of 1000. Hmm, that's a big difference. I must have messed up the breakdown in the first method. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, so the first method was wrong because I broke it down incorrectly. Let's see:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\nBut 20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 24 = 29524, correct.\n\nNow, 29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nAdding 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nBut direct multiplication gives 87572. There's a conflict. I must have made a mistake in the breakdown. Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, but 29000 * 3 is 87000, not 60000 + 27000. Wait, that's where I went wrong. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, so 60000 + 27000 is 87000, which is correct. Then 500*3 is 1500, so 87000 + 1500 is 88500. Then 24*3 is 72, so 88500 +72=88572.\n\nBut when I do it directly, I get 87572. So, there must be a mistake in the direct multiplication.\n\nWait, let me check the direct multiplication again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but according to the breakdown, it's 88572. So, I must have messed up the breakdown. Wait, 29524*3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3 is the same as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches the breakdown. So, where did I go wrong in the direct multiplication? Let me check again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n9*3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the number is 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 877572? No, no, wait, the digits are:\n\nFrom right to left:\n\nFirst digit: 2\n\nSecond digit:7\n\nThird digit:5\n\nFourth digit:7\n\nFifth digit:7\n\nSixth digit:8\n\nSo, writing it from left to right: 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is much less than 800,000. Wait, I think I messed up the places. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27: write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\nFrom right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8.\n\nSo, writing from left to right: 8,7,7,5,7,2.\n\nWhich is 877572. Wait, that's not correct because 29524*3 is 88572, not 877572. I must have miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nWhen multiplied by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from units place:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):9*3=27 +1=28. Wait, no, carry over is 1, so 9*3=27 +1=28. So, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place):2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, the correct multiplication is 87572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I did the breakdown, I thought it was 88572, but actually, the correct result is 87572. So, where did I go wrong in the breakdown? Let's see:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, adding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nBut direct multiplication gives 87572. There's a conflict. I must have made a mistake in the breakdown. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. But direct multiplication gave me 87572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n(29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3\n\n29000*3 = 87000\n\n524*3 = 1572\n\nNow, add them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the breakdown method. Therefore, the direct multiplication must have been done incorrectly earlier. Let me check the direct multiplication again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, earlier I thought I got 87572, but that must have been a mistake. The correct multiplication is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If I compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had a conflict, but now it's clear. The correct result is 88572.\n\nSo, going back, the expression was 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 was 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recap the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWe can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r=3\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is nested within the previous, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost out, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth. Multiplying the ninth layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should work step by step, computing each layer as I go. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out: the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40.\n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Fourth layer is 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Fifth layer is 364.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that: 3*364 is... Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Sixth layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Seventh layer is 3280.\n\nMoving outward: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me figure this out. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... Wait, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so 2400 + 123 is 2523. So, 3*9841 is 27000 + 2523, which is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Ninth layer is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, I thought there were nine layers, but when I started, the innermost was layer 1, so layer 9 would be the outermost one. But in the original problem, the expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Since layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 would be the final result. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed a layer. Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...)) occurs. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1+...). So, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...). Each time, there's a new 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3. So, the total number of layers is 9, because starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly, leading to the result 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to write each layer step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds another term, and the coefficients are powers of 3. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 each time we go outward. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 3^2, and so on. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So,\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this expression by expanding each layer:\n\nFirst, the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, perhaps another way to think about it is that each time, we're adding another term in a geometric progression. Let me see: The expression can be written as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds a term that's 3^k, perhaps the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by some coefficients. But I think the recursive approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nIf I look at the innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term in the geometric series with ratio 3. So, for n layers, the value is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer adds another term, so for layer m, the value is the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k. But wait, in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, which is 1 + 3^1. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13, which is the sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, each layer m corresponds to the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k. So, for layer 9, it would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another term. So, the number of layers corresponds to the number of terms in the sum.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is two terms: 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9, which is three terms: 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nContinuing outward, each layer adds another term, so the nth layer from the inside would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nBut in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2).\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed layer 9, I got 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me check: sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, layer 9 is 29524, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is by recognizing that each layer corresponds to the sum of a geometric series up to a certain term, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series with a certain number of terms, each multiplied by 3 raised to a power. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I expand E, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, but the number of terms would correspond to the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to write E as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, because each layer adds another term. Wait, actually, each layer adds a new term when expanded, but the number of terms would be equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute E by expanding all the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series with first term a and common ratio r is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, each layer adds a term that's a power of 3. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nContinuing outward, each layer adds another term, so the outermost layer is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nThen, the entire expression E is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That matches the result I got earlier.\n\nSo, another way to compute E is to recognize that it's 3 times the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^9, which gives us 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The outermost layer is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). So, that would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Which is indeed (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents directly. Since each layer is a sum of powers of 3 up to a certain point, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something similar.\n\nBut I think the methods I've used so far are sufficient. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, used the recursive formula, and also recognized it as a geometric series, all leading to the same result: 88572.\n\nI feel confident that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different approaches all converge to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(innermost layer) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40 first: that's 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 2*3 is 6, 9*3 is 27, 5*3 is 15, 2*3 is 6, 4*3 is 12. But wait, that's digit by digit, but I think I should compute it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but that's the next layer. So, now we're at the outermost layer: 3*(result from the previous step). So, 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 88573 \u00d7 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 1 carried over is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 2 carried over is 26.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it properly:\n\n88573\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9, write 9.\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2.\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write 6 and 2, but since we're at the leftmost digit, we just write 26.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 88573 \u00d7 3 is actually 265,719.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me compute 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write 6 and carry 2, but since there are no more digits, we write 26.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but 88573 \u00d7 3 = 265,719? Let me verify that with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 88573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing this manually.\n\nLet me recap the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Next: 1 + 3\u00d729,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Finally: 3\u00d788,573 = 265,719\n\nWait, but hold on, when I started, I thought there were nine sets of parentheses, but when I counted, I ended up with 11 layers. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1 + ... Each time, a new (1 + 3(...) starts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(... So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of '1 + 3(' sections.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach '1 + 3(' is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nHow many are there? Let's see, from the innermost to the outermost, each time we have a new layer. The innermost is the last (1 + 3), then each step out adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with nine closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3(1 + 3(...), there are nine closing parentheses. That suggests there are nine layers of nesting. Hmm, so maybe I overcounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let me try again, but this time, I'll count the number of layers correctly.\n\nEach time I see a '(', it's a new layer, except for the initial one. Wait, no, actually, each '1 + 3(' is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last '1 + 3' before the closing parentheses. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write it as follows, with each layer properly indented:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nBut to make it clearer, let me count the number of '1 + 3(' occurrences. Each occurrence adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), then each preceding '1 + 3(' adds a new layer. So, how many times does '1 + 3(' occur? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLooking at this, each time after the initial 3(1 + 3(..., there are nine '1 + 3(' instances. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of times '1 + 3(' appears, which would indicate the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and see how many steps I take.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I went through 11 layers, but perhaps that's correct because the expression has nine layers of nesting, but each layer adds another computation step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering the innermost as the first step, but maybe I should consider that the innermost is the first computation, and then each step out adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed step by step, regardless of the count, and see where that takes me.\n\nLet me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29,524) = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(88,573) = 265,719\n\nWait, but according to this, there are 11 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each preceding '1 + 3(' adds a new layer. Let me count the number of '1 + 3(' after the initial 3(...):\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach '1 + 3(' is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and each preceding one adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving out, each '1 + 3(' adds a new layer. So, how many '1 + 3(' are there after the initial 3(...)?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are nine '1 + 3(' instances. So, that would mean there are nine layers, each corresponding to one '1 + 3('.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 11 layers. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each '1 + 3(' corresponds to a layer, and the initial 3(...) is the outermost layer. So, let's try again, this time counting correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(...)) where the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3(...)) where the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it by recognizing that the expression is a repeated multiplication, which can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated than just computing each layer step by step, especially since the number of layers isn't too large.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute each layer correctly, ensuring I don't make any mistakes in the arithmetic.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3*(29,524) = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Layer 11: 3*(88,573) = 265,719\n\nWait, but according to this, there are 11 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), then each preceding '1 + 3(' adds a layer. Let's count how many times '1 + 3(' appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach '1 + 3(' after the initial 3(...) is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nWait, so there are nine '1 + 3(' instances after the initial 3(...). That suggests there are nine layers, each corresponding to one '1 + 3('.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, I ended up with 11 layers, which doesn't match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in how I counted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3(...) is layer 1, and each subsequent '1 + 3(' adds a new layer. So, let's try again, starting with layer 1 as the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of '1 + 3(' instances, which is nine. Therefore, there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I should compute nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 11 layers, which suggests that I included the initial 3*(...) as a layer, which might not be necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute nine layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with layer 1 as the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29,524.\n\nCompute 3*29,524:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match my earlier result of 265,719. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I confused the number of layers. If there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...), then the final result is 3*(layer 9) = 88,572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier approach where I had 11 layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach '1 + 3(' adds a new layer, and the number of '1 + 3(' instances is nine, as I can count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nYes, nine '1 + 3(' instances, meaning nine layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems different from my initial approach where I ended up with 265,719. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer, thus leading to 11 layers. But according to the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are nine layers of '1 + 3('.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of layers inside the initial 3*(...) is nine, leading to the final result of 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check that by substituting the layers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the initial 3*(...) is layer 10, and the innermost is layer 1, making a total of 10 layers. But that seems conflicting with the earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer, and each preceding '1 + 3*(...)' is a layer, up to the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, perhaps my initial approach where I went up to 11 layers was incorrect because I included the initial 3*(...) as a layer, but in reality, the initial 3*(...) is the multiplier outside the nine layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I had 11 layers, leading to 265,719, which is much larger. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expression step by step, carefully, to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step, ensuring I don't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, leading to 265,719. So, I must have miscounted the layers initially. It seems that the correct approach is to consider that there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...), leading to 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTo confirm, let me compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm computing the right expression.\n\nThe problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nYes, that's nine '1 + 3(' layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the initial 3*(...) as an additional layer, but in reality, it's just the multiplier outside the nine layers. So, the correct computation leads to 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives us the next layer's value. Let me see if I can generalize this. If I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, say a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost, then each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Since there are nine layers, I need to compute up to a_9. Let me compute each term step by step. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, after computing each layer, the innermost gives us 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous by 3 and adds 1, leading up to a_9 = 29524. Now, looking back at the original expression, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a_9. So, the original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me verify a couple of the a_n terms to be sure. Let's check a4: a3 is 40, so a4 should be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. a5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's see what happens for n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I wrote 88,572. Yes, that's the same number. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step calculation. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
