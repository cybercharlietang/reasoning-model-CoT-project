Let me count how many digits 29524 has. It's 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying by 3, we should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0\n\nWait, that's only 5 digits. So the result should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n= ?\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5 * 3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2 * 3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. But wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 first:\n29524 + 29524:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1\n9 + 9 +1=19, carryover 1\n2 + 2 +1=5\nSo that's 59048.\n\nNow add 29524 to 59048:\n59048 + 29524:\n8 + 4 =12, write 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 +1=7\n0 + 5=5\n9 + 9=18, write 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 +1=8\nSo that's 88572. Okay, so that checks out. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So that should be the final answer. But let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nThere's a carryover of 2 from the 9*3 step, so we add that to the next digit, which is 2 (from 29524). Wait, no, actually, 29524 has digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- Since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would be added as a new digit on the left, making it 1. Wait, no, because 2*3 +2=8, so we don't have a carryover beyond that. Wait, actually, 2*3=6 +2=8, so no carryover beyond that. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that by another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = Now, adding them up:\n\n60000 +27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A -3A=1 \u21d2 -2A=1 \u21d2 A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, it's 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer wraps around that. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is another layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time moving out, another 1+. So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then, layer 2: 1+3*(layer1). Layer 3: 1+3*(layer2). Continuing until layer 9: 1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that's 9 layers inside, each adding 1+3*(...). So, my initial computation was correct, with layer1 to layer9, each computed step by step, leading to layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer1: a1=1+3=4. Then, a2=1+3*a1=1+3*4=13. a3=1+3*a2=1+3*13=40. And so on. This looks like a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for an in terms of n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a1=4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for the nth layer and compute the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term}) \\).

So adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. I think I did that correctly. So, the steps are: Compute each layer from the inside out, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1, then finally multiply the outermost result by 3 again. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying by 3 again.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.

So, reading the digits from top: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps there's a geometric series or some recursive formula here. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... L9 = 1 + 3*L8 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Ln = A*r^n + B, where r is the common ratio. But in this case, since it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Alternatively, since each term is defined by Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, we can write this as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L9 = (3^10)/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, since each layer is a recurrence, and I've found a formula for Ln, I could have directly computed L9 using the formula without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Another way to think about this is that each time you're effectively adding a term that's three times the previous total, which can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as such. Starting from L1: 4. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Which is 1 + 3*4. L3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4. L4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*4. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each subsequent layer adds another term that's a power of 3 multiplied by 4, plus the sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... up to some power. Let me try to express Ln in terms of a sum. For L1: 4 = 4. L2: 13 = 1 + 3*4. L3: 40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4. L4: 121 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*4. So, in general, Ln = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^(n-1)) + 3^n*4. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^(n-1) is a geometric series with ratio 3, so its sum is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n. Let me simplify that: Ln = (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n -1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n -1)/2. Wait, that seems different from the earlier formula. Let me check for n=1: L1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Wait, but L1 was 4. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the generalization. Let me go back. Looking at L1: 4. L2: 13 = 1 + 3*4. L3: 40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4. L4: 121 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*4. So, in general, Ln = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}) + 3^n*4. The sum 1 + 3 + ... + 3^{n-1} is (3^n -1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^n. Let me compute that: (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n -1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n -1)/2. Wait, but for n=1, this gives (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is L2, not L1. So, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me adjust. Since L1 corresponds to n=1, but in the formula above, n=1 gives L2. Therefore, maybe the formula should be Ln = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (9*3^{1} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (9*3^2 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the correct formula is Ln = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Therefore, L9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561=59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is a linear operation, and after 9 layers, it's like applying that operation 9 times. But in this case, since each operation is nested, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula as I did. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost out, verified the results with a recurrence relation, and then used a formula derived from the recurrence to compute the final layer. All methods led to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern.

Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations because that would throw off everything. Let me recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each step manually. But just for practice, maybe I can think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or some other pattern. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at the numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, an = 3*a(n-1) + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for an. The general solution for such a recurrence is an = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is an = 3*a(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a1 = 4. When n=1: a1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*(3^(10) -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's pretty cool. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula. \n\n1. **Identify the recurrence relation**: \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\).\n2. **Find the homogeneous and particular solutions**:\n   - Homogeneous solution: \\( a_h = C \\cdot 3^n \\).\n   - Particular solution: \\( a_p = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n3. **General solution**: \\( a_n = C \\cdot 3^n - \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n4. **Determine the constant \\( C \\)** using the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\):\n   - \\( 4 = 3C - \\frac{1}{2} \\) leads to \\( C = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n5. **Closed-form expression**: \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n6. **Compute the innermost layer (n=9)**:\n   - \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n7. **Multiply by 3** as per the original expression:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the intermediate steps.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572. Let me check with another method. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the entire inner expression, then x = 1 + 3x, but wait, that might not capture the entire depth. Alternatively, since there are 9 layers, it's a finite geometric series. Let me try to model it that way. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, layer 1: 1 + 3. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc. So, in general, each layer adds another factor of 3. So, the total expression can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are 9 ones and 9 threes. Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more 3 multiplication. Let me think differently. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are 9 layers, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed earlier. But perhaps I can express the entire thing as a sum. Let me see: The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. Wait, that might not be accurate because each term is nested, not multiplied in a straight line. Let me try to see:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me try to expand this. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and so on, 9 times. So, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's finite, it's a finite geometric series. The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is S_n = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is nested. Let me see if I can represent E as a sum. Let me try to write E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1s and 3s. Each layer adds a 1 and a 3. Since there are 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each outer layer adds 1 + 3*(...). So, expanding E would involve 9 ones and 9 threes, but each nested. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 layers. Let me try to see how many terms there are. Each time you go out a layer, you add another multiplication by 3. So, the innermost term is 3^1, then 3^2, up to 3^9. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the total expression can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 layers. So, if I expand it, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to compute this step by step, but maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to represent this without computing each layer manually. From earlier, I found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, since E=3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I get E=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this makes sense because each layer is contributing a power of 3, and the formula for the sum of a geometric series applies here, even though it's nested. By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation or the geometric series formula, I can avoid computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (next nested term). By recognizing this as a geometric series, we can derive the solution using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series or by solving the recurrence relation. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer can be expressed as \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\). Solving this recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) is given by \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the ninth layer, this becomes \\((3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9 or earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the innermost part all the way out without labeling the layers. Let's try that approach. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, moving outward: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Then: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572 Yes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. However, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times and through different methods, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

So putting it all together: 27, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (from the 2*3 +2), 8 (from 9*3 +1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3 +1), 2 (from 4*3). So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if that approach works, just to confirm.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). Starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because the multiplication seems high. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which is our case: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the general solution.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify RHS: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^{n} + B = RHS: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSo, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, recognize the recurrence and compute using the formula, or use the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Okay, that confirms it. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any of those, the final answer will be wrong.

Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let's see if that's the case. The recursion here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if that's correct. For Layer1, a1=4. Layer2=1 +3*4=13=a2. Layer3=1 +3*13=40=a3. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. The homogeneous solution for a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the equation: K -3*K =1 => -2K=1 => K=-1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer9, which is a9, n=9: a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4*3=12, so write 2 and carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5 and carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8 and carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems solid. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation allows us to determine the value of the innermost layer, which is then used to compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by substituting the value of the previous layer into the expression.\n\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognize that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For Layer 9, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be the correct answer because when I compute each layer, I might have made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me double-check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let me compute 3\u00d7364: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. Let's compute 3\u00d71093: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280.

Compute 3\u00d79841: Let's break it down:\n\n9000\u00d73=27000\n\n800\u00d73=2400\n\n40\u00d73=120\n\n1\u00d73=3\n\nNow add them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 +3=29523\n\nThen 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3. So, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the pattern is that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it using this method.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly. Since the layers are from 1 to 9, and the formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct. So, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). But in the formula, L_n represents the value inside the parentheses, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula directly. Since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure that I didn't make any mistakes earlier.\n\nLayer 1: n=1, L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, L2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, L3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, L4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5, L5=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6, L6=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7, L7=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8, L8=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9, L9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: (3^{11}-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, used the formula, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Each time, we have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the initial 3*(...). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the inside out, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost. So, how many layers are there? Let's see, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)) where the innermost is (1+3). So, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then the next is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9. So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is four digits: 9,8,4,1.\n\nSo:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the 2 carried over as 2. So 9841*3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed 3*29524, I got 88572, but let me confirm that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, is 88572 the correct final answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9, and then the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nBut I think my step-by-step computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, both methods agree, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute it again: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's a bit time-consuming, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could make this faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n = 1, L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me see if I can find another equation. Let's compute L(2): L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from L(1)) 9A + B = 13 (from L(2)) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step. That would be useful if there were more layers, say, 20 layers. But for nine layers, both methods work fine. So, I think I've got the correct answer here: 88,572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling them for clarity. 3. Once all layers were computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3 as per the original expression. 4. As a sanity check, derive a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations and verify that it matches the step-by-step computations. 5. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. This method ensures that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way and that the answer is consistent regardless of the approach used. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to be confident in the solution, especially when dealing with repetitive and potentially error-prone calculations. I think I'm pretty confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; total 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 *3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; adding up: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, so the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: characteristic equation r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this makes sense. I started by computing each layer step by step, which took a bit of time but was straightforward. Then, I noticed a pattern and derived a formula using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. It's always good to check your work with a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive expression. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1), compute each subsequent layer using the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply Recurrence Formula:**\n   Recognize the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) and derive the closed-form solution:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For Layer 9 (\\(n=9\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the value of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88,572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but wait, I feel like this number is a bit large. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. At n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence relation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Let me use the homogeneous and particular solutions approach. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Perfect! So, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I recognized the nested structure and saw that each layer follows a recurrence relation. I computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, which took a while but was straightforward. Then, I noticed the pattern and derived a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result for Layer 9. Multiplying by 3 gave me the final answer.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it more quickly, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to explore, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to generalize it. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the recursion: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this recursion with a formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. First, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. So whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then multiplying by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me think if there's a formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine terms, computing each step is straightforward. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be expressed as a_n = (a_1 + c/(k - 1))*(k)^{n-1} - c/(k - 1). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n-1}*a_1 + c*(k^{n-1} - 1)/(k - 1). Let me verify that. Suppose we have a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. Then, solving this recurrence, the homogeneous solution is A*k^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B, leading to B = k*B + c, so B = c/(1 - k). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*k^{n} + c/(1 - k). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can solve for A. So, a_1 = A*k + c/(1 - k) = 4. Let me plug in k=3 and c=1, since in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=1, k=3. Therefore, a_n = A*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nn=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1=4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula. So, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29524*3. Let me compute it as (30000 - 476)*3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Perfect, same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the recursive pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nUsing the closed-form formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the ninth layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So, reading it from top to bottom: 7, 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Write down 7.\n\nSo putting it all together, we have 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7\n\n5 * 3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n5 *3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 *3 differently.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 =27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me double-check the layers because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in the computation.\n\nLet me go back step by step and verify each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting so big, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another approach to compute the layers again, just to be sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of computing each layer step by step, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute it more efficiently. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric sequence, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it.\n\nActually, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n=1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n=1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1\n\nSo, B= -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4\n\nSo, 3A -1/2=4\n\n3A=4 +1/2=9/2\n\nA= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Let me recompute a few layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a formula, we can use that to compute a_9 directly.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the ninth layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try again, maybe using a better method. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit from right to left. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, but 29524 has only 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when I multiply 29524 by 3, it's 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nFrom the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(...\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: because after the first 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, the first layer is 1+3(...). Let me count each \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, but each time, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. So, actually, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), and so on, up to layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, ending at 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, no, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Let me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each \"(\" after that starts a new layer. Let me count the number of layers by the number of closing parentheses. Each \"(\" must have a corresponding \")\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances where \"1+3(\" occurs, each starting a new layer. So, the innermost is layer1: 1+3, then layer2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in my earlier calculation, I correctly computed up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me list out each layer's computation:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the first layer, which is layer9. So, I think my computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can write out the expression with variables to see the pattern.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find C, we can use the method of solving linear recurrences.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 27,8852? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me try again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: There's a 9 in the ten-thousands place? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, after the 2 in the ten-thousands place, we've already written all digits. Wait, no, 29524 is 29,524. So, 2*3=6, plus the carryover of 2 from the previous step? Wait, no, in the previous step, when we did 9*3=27 +1=28, we wrote down 8 and carried over 2. Then, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). So, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Then, the next digit is 9, which is in the thousands place. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, but 9 is the next digit, but actually, the number is 29524, so after the 2 (ten-thousands place), the digits are 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when we get to the 9, we have 9*3=27 + carryover 2=29. So, write down 9, carry over 2. Then, the next digit is 2 (ten-thousands place). 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, but that's the last digit, so the final number would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 *3: 29,524 *3. Let me compute 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the number is 88,572. So, 3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it still gives me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using this method, each layer is computed step by step until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

So the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So yes, layer 9 is the outermost one, which we computed as 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1).\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1)\n\nBut a_1 is 4, so:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nWait, let me check that formula again. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1)\n\nSo, plugging in a_1=4, c=1, k=3:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2\n\nCompute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let's compute that:\n\n6561 \u00d7 9:\n\n6000 \u00d7 9 = 54000\n\n500 \u00d7 9 = 4500\n\n60 \u00d7 9 = 540\n\n1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n\nAdd them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049.\n\nSo, 9*6561 = 59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524, then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFrom layer 1 to layer 2: 4 to 13. 13 is 4*3 +1=13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 13*3 +1=40, correct.\n\nLayer 4:40*3 +1=121, correct.\n\nLayer 5:121*3 +1=364, correct.\n\nLayer 6:364*3 +1=1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7:1093*3 +1=3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8:3280*3 +1=9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9:9841*3 +1=29524, correct.\n\nYes, so each layer is just 3 times the previous plus 1. So the formula applies correctly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe I should just do 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.
