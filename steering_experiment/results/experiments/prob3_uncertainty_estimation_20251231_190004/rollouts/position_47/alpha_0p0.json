So that should be correct. But let me verify by computing each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit unsure because when I saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe there's a geometric series or something similar here. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct result. It was a bit tedious computing each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation provided a quicker way to verify the result. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, as both methods gave the same answer, so I feel good about this.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence relation yields the general formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the way I computed it was correct: compute each layer up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1, L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAt n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAt n=3, L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*L9 =3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I'm a bit confused now. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524.

Then, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually every time. Let's see, the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Let me just do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is only 5 digits, so after 9*3, we should have no more digits. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me use another method: 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, so the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each layer has one more than the previous. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8). So, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the multiplication because sometimes when I'm tired, I make mistakes. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions earlier. Let me write it properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying the multiplication, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572.

So, reading from the top, it's 8 8 5 7 2. So 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula for this. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). This looks like a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total is 3*a_9. So, as I did before, computing each a_n step by step is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then the total is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, using the formula also gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the process. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. So, after computing up to a_9 = 29524, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The general form is a recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so each layer is (previous layer)*3 + 1. Starting from 1, but in this case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. So, perhaps the formula can be applied as I did before. Either way, it seems that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Compute each subsequent layer by plugging the previous result into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524. 3. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524 = 88572. 4. Verified using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the result of the previous layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^{n}. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The original expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could express the entire expression using the formula. Since the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the formula is much faster and less error-prone. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I found that each layer can be represented by a formula involving powers of 3. This allowed me to compute the innermost layers more efficiently and then build up to the outermost layer, ultimately multiplying by 3 to get the final result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

So, putting it together: 7 7 8 5 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 88572. But let me verify the earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my multiplication again because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might make an error. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 + 9524=79048 + 9000=88048, 88048 + 524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost: Each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, from layer1 to layer9, that's nine layers. So, yes, Layer9 is the outermost one, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3=1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If we assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative layer-by-layer computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me consider that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. We can write this as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the equation: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches L_1=4. Similarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches L_2=13. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Let me try to write out the first few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are small, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each L_n is similar to a geometric series. Let me try expanding a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n=> A - 3A = 1\n=> -2A = 1\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again gives the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the value is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can compute each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer until we reach the outermost one. Then, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the innermost expression and compute each layer outward.\n2. Each layer follows the form: Layer n = 1 + 3 * (Layer (n-1)).\n3. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer again because a small mistake early on can throw off the entire calculation. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I computed 3*9841, I thought it was 29523, which seems correct because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, yes, 29523 +1=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1+. So, that's 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, 3*(Layer9) is the final step. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each time, it's like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer by both iterative computation and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. It's always good to verify the result using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is building up a number in base 3. Wait, let me see: Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are represented in base 3. For example, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) would represent a number where each digit is 1 in base 3. But since we're dealing with a finite number of layers, it's more of a geometric series in base 3. Let me explore that.\n\nIf we have n layers, each contributing a 1 in base 3, the value would be (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly what we derived earlier for L_n. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, this base 3 interpretation also leads us to the same result, which further solidifies that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, by iteratively computing each layer, setting up a recurrence relation, and interpreting the structure in terms of base 3 numbers, I've arrived at the same result each time. This consistency across different methods makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the number is 88572. Hmm, wait, but let me check: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Let me write the expression with each opening parenthesis: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)): 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(1+3)) 3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) ... Up to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" introduces a new layer. Wait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+\" appears, excluding the first one. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to list each layer step by step, ensuring that I have the correct number of layers. Let me try again, carefully. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving out, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" sections. From the expression, after the first 3*, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3*(...\". Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- The second layer inside: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each time we move outward, we add another layer. So, if I have n layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" starting from the first one after the initial 3. So, starting from the first 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does \"1 + 3*(...\" occur? Let me count: Starting from the first 1 + 3, that's one. Then each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3*(...\" occurs. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3 (no multiplication yet)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...), which is 8 times, because the innermost is just 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nLet me think of the expression as a tree. Each time you have a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new node. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first node. Then, moving outward, each node is 1 + 3*(previous node). So, how many nodes are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\n- The first opening parenthesis after 3* is for the first 1 + 3*(...).\n- Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis for the next 1 + 3*(...).\n- This continues until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there? Let me count:\n\nStarting after the first 3*:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...)\n2. (1 + 3*(...)\n3. (1 + 3*(...)\n4. (1 + 3*(...)\n5. (1 + 3*(...)\n6. (1 + 3*(...)\n7. (1 + 3*(...)\n8. (1 + 3*(...)\n9. (1 + 3\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have an opening parenthesis beyond that. So, actually, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3* is 8, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another opening parenthesis. So, total layers would be 8, starting from the innermost. Wait, but when I first started, I thought there were 9 layers. I'm confused now. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3*( (layer 1)\n2. (layer 2)\n3. (layer 3)\n4. (layer 4)\n5. (layer 5)\n6. (layer 6)\n7. (layer 7)\n8. (layer 8)\n9. (layer 9)\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3*. So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, my initial calculation where I had 9 layers was correct. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier when I was recounting, I thought maybe I had only 8 layers, but now I'm seeing that there are 9 layers because each opening parenthesis after the initial 3* adds a new layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute each layer again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer, the outermost result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct) Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner expression is similar to E, but without the initial 3. Let me see: Let me define S as the inner expression: S =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )). Then, S =1 +3*S, because the inner expression is the same as S. Solving for S: S =1 +3S => S -3S =1 => -2S=1 => S= -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because S is clearly a positive number. I must have made a mistake here. Wait, no, because in the original problem, the expression isn't infinite; it's finite with nine layers. So, maybe the approach of using a geometric series isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost layer, each step adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, after n layers, the value would be (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, that's similar to what I found earlier. So, in our case, n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*L_9=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try expanding it step by step without substituting each layer, just to see if I can find a pattern. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote the innermost as A: A=1+3=4 Then, moving out, B=1+3A=1+12=13 C=1+3B=1+39=40 D=1+3C=1+120=121 E=1+3D=1+363=364 F=1+3E=1+1092=1093 G=1+3F=1+3279=3280 H=1+3G=1+9840=9841 I=1+3H=1+29523=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*I=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different approach, like recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me try that. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each step is 1 + 3*previous. If I consider the entire expression, it's a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let's expand the expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 +3*4=13\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=121\n\nThen, 1 +3*121=364\n\nThen, 1 +3*364=1093\n\nThen, 1 +3*1093=3280\n\nThen, 1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for E in terms of the number of layers.\n\nLet me denote n as the number of layers. Each layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 10, minus 1, all over 2, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, that might complicate things, but let me try.\n\nThe sum S =1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^9 = (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nWait, no, because each step is 1 +3*(1 +3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is similar to the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 +3*previous, which can be represented as 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )).\n\nSo, if I let S =1 +3*S, then S=(1)/(1-3)= -1/2, but that's for an infinite series, which isn't the case here.\n\nBut since we have a finite number of layers, 9, we can use the formula for the finite geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time we have a layer, it's 1 +3*previous.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4=3^1 +1? No, 3^1=3, 3+1=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13=3^2 +3 +1=9+3+1=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=27+9+3+1=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each layer n is equal to the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^{n}.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nLayer 1:4=3^0 +3^1=1+3=4. Yes.\n\nLayer 2:13=3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1+3+9=13.\n\nLayer 3:40=3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=1+3+9+27=40.\n\nLayer 4:121=3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3 +3^4=1+3+9+27+81=121.\n\nYes, so each layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, the sum would be (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses, but that would be tedious given the nine layers. However, just for thoroughness, let me try to see what the expanded form would look like.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step, layer by layer:\n\nFirst, the innermost is (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen, moving out, we have (1 +3*(4))=1 +12=13.\n\nNext layer: (1 +3*(13))=1 +39=40.\n\nNext: (1 +3*40)=1 +120=121.\n\nNext: (1 +3*121)=1 +363=364.\n\nNext: (1 +3*364)=1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext: (1 +3*1093)=1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext: (1 +3*3280)=1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext: (1 +3*9841)=1 +29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, writing it out:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we have 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each nested inside the previous. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then moving out, each time another 1+3(...). How many layers? Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\nEach ( is an opening parenthesis, so starting from the first after 3(, that's the first layer, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, the first ( is at 1+3(, then each subsequent layer adds another (.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. ( after 1+3(\n2. ( after the next 1+3(\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: Each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), which is two layers. Each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1+3, and each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n.\n\nThe solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire expression as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step calculations. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 27, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 3*29524 = 88572.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and check each layer step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check Layer 8 again because when I computed Layer 8, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, but I have to make sure I'm not miscounting.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that with another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each time you have a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, that's 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, etc., up to Layer 9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition:\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find another equation by considering the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a recurrence relation to find a formula, and confirmed that the result is consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3 times Layer 9, which is 3\u00d729524, which is indeed 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me set up the recurrence properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*a_9, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the original expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result as before.\n\nThat's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula approach, let me check the exponents again.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Since 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 to get 177144, then divide by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a step-by-step approach, each layer is calculated until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D. When n approaches infinity, the term C*3^n would dominate, but since we have a finite number of layers (n=9), maybe we can find a closed-form expression. Alternatively, we can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nFirst, multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nFinally, the leading 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should compute it as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, so 7 with a carryover of 2.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, so 7 with a carryover of 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, so 7 with a carryover of 2.\n- Finally, the leading 0 (since we're done with digits) times 3 plus 2 is 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me count the digits in 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So when I multiply by 3, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo putting it together: 87,582. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000; 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, yes, I computed nine layers correctly. So, I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the solution:\n\n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should just do it step by step without breaking it down too much. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Let's compute 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all out: 2 (from 4*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 8 (from 2*3+2), then 7 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 5*3+2), then 7 (from 2*3+1). Wait, but that seems to be 8 digits, but 29524 is 5 digits, so when multiplied by 3, it should be 5 or 6 digits. Let me write it properly with place values:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x      3\n   -----------\n     ? ? ? ? ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Layer3: 1+3(Layer2). Continuing up to Layer9, which is the outermost. So, I think I did compute up to Layer9 correctly, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = b^n * C + (a)/(1 - b), but only if b \u2260 1. In our case, a = 1, b = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, but wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, because the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. So, L_1 = 4. Let's use n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Alternatively, maybe I should check each layer's computation again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series to confirm. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, solving for a_n in terms of a_1, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me find B by plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a_n = B + C*3^n. Plugging in: B + C*3^n = 1 + 3*(B + C*3^{n-1}) = 1 + 3B + C*3^n. Comparing both sides: B + C*3^n = 1 + 3B + C*3^n. So, subtracting C*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd because all our a_n values are positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each term step by step as I did before, since the numbers are manageable. So, sticking with the step-by-step computation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me write it down:\n\n    29524\n  x     3\n  ---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we're done.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3 * 9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is 1 + 3*a_n. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is growing rapidly. To find a closed-form, let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. The key was recognizing the pattern and setting up the recurrence relation, which allowed me to find a closed-form expression and avoid computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone, especially for more layers. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but having the formula is a good check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, repeated multiple times. So, it's similar to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant at each step. The closed-form formula we derived accounts for that, so it's a neat way to handle such problems without getting lost in the layers.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern, setting up the recurrence, solving it, and then computing the final value, I arrived at the solution. I think this is solid, and I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the closed-form solution and compute the result step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). This can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution:**\n   Solving the recurrence relation, we find:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute \\(a_9\\):**\n   For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier computations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279? Let me check: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so yes, 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3 times that. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me write down the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence might give me a formula to compute a_9 directly, which could save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D So, equating both sides: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence relation, I could have noticed the pattern in the numbers. Each layer's result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final answer. Either way, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSubstituting the assumed form:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let me double-check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the number of layers is small (only nine), computing each layer step by step is manageable. However, if there were more layers, perhaps a formula would be more efficient. But for now, step-by-step computation works fine.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize the pattern in the layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence can sometimes be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*A\n\n9/2 = 3*A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form solution, we arrive at the same answer. This makes me even more confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 can be seen as a geometric progression.\n\nBut in this case, since the expression is finite (nine layers), the closed-form approach using the recurrence relation was more straightforward.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each calculation is correct.\n\n3. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and solve it using standard techniques, which confirms the step-by-step result.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, so I'm certain that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should just do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Okay, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and deriving a closed-form formula, we find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula:\n   - L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\n3. **Compute Layer 9**: Since there are 9 layers, compute L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times L_9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. This seems like a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, let's assume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with 9 terms, but I think the approach I took is sufficient. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.
