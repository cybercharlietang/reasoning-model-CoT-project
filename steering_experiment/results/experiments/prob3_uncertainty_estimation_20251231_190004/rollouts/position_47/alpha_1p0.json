    "text": " Let me compute digit by digit from the right. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify the multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4.

Let's go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is Layer 1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, which is Layer 2, and so on up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me recall how to solve such a recurrence.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match.\n\nFor example, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works, so a_9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence formula give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until reaching the outermost one. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of recursive multiplication.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3a_8\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula seems to hold.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? So the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and after 9 layers, it's a_9. Then, 3*a_9 is the total expression. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let's denote each layer as a_n, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer follows the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost layer a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: The recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: Since there are 9 layers, we compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9, which gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\n6. **Calculate the Result**: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 8 was 9841, right? Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841 first. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u2192 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without calculating each layer. That's a good way to verify the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above.\n\nBut using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, as we did earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly as 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*L_9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, this method also confirms the answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find a general formula for each layer and then compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the recurrence relation**: The general solution is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but hold on. Let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. Because if I messed up one layer, all subsequent layers would be wrong. Let's recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since we have a formula, maybe we can use it to compute directly without going through each layer, but in this case, since the number of layers is manageable, computing step by step is feasible. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers is larger. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, we found that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that, ultimately leading to the outermost expression evaluating to 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us a closed-form formula, which confirms the step-by-step computation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, the first opening parenthesis is after 3, then each subsequent opening parenthesis is after each \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another (.\n\nSo starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another. So total layers are 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me try computing the layers again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression is 3*(Layer9), so yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me verify each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So after computing Layer9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nBut let me think again: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed Layer9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\na1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1, a1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAt n=2, a2=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo in our case, we have 9 layers, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So then the final expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a9, and a9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression.\n\nBut either way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into this form:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times the value of the outermost layer (Layer 9), which is 29524. Multiplying 29524 by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute it without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct result. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and the different methods all lead to the same answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, this formula works. Therefore, layer n has the value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. So, to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, verified each computation, then recognized a pattern which allowed me to use a formula for the nth term of the sequence, applied it, and arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and applying a formula. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the general solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this results in \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify my layers again because 88572 seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, working through each layer step by step also gets me to the same result. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me go back and check each layer calculation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. The problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) with nine layers. So, does that mean that the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, yeah, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, 9 layers of that. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series. In this case, k=3 and c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (c/(k - 1))*(k^n - 1). Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5. So, a_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5. Simplifying, 1.5 is 3/2, so a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. The recursive relation for each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is the innermost Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer is built upon that, so when I get to Layer 9, it's the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote the value at each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, so let's assume a_n^(p) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, when I computed Layer 9, that was the innermost expression, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nWe can write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches.\n\nSo, this formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me try to compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer.\n\nGiven that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which corresponds to a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the innermost term as x, then the next term is 1 + 3x, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. So, each layer adds another power of 3 multiplied by the initial x, which is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so x=4. Then the next term is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, each term can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. To be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nCompute a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out with the formula. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be absolutely certain, I can compute the entire expression step by step, but that would take a long time. Alternatively, I can write a small program or use a calculator to verify the multiplication, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll just double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...): From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of parentheses pairs: The innermost is (1+3), then each next layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3( ... ) where ... is 1+3(...). So, each time we have a new ( after 1+3, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each ( adds a layer. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, we have another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...) starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3(, we have 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3(. Each ( corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) : 1 (\n- Then inside, 1+3( : another (\n- Inside that, 1+3( : another (\n- Continuing this way until the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of ( after the initial 3. Let me write the expression as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of (:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that seems off because the innermost is (1+3), so the number of layers is 9. Let me recount:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th opening parenthesis, and then it's closed. So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, n=9 layers. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the digits are 7,7,8,5,2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   --------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I have a 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), and each time another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1+3(...), then another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me see: The expression is 3 followed by 1+3(...), which is 9 times because each time after the first 3, there are 9 layers. Wait, no, let me think. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So each time, the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3(...) inside. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time another layer. So the total number of layers is 9, because each time we have 1+3(...), and there are 9 such layers after the initial 3. Wait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and each time you go one layer deeper, so the number of layers is 9. So the computation I did earlier, going up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572, seems correct. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate. Let me try computing another layer to confirm. Let's say Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the structure is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps we can model this recursively.\n\nLet me define a function f(n), where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSo, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nBut in the problem, we have nine layers, so f(9) would be the value at the innermost part, but actually, the expression is 3*(f(9)). Wait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let's clarify. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from Layer 1 as f(1)=4, then f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., up to f(9)=29524. Then the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nGiven f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume f_p(n) = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute f(9):\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the innermost part after 9 layers is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus three times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer was computed correctly, so the final answer should indeed be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the general formula. Let me check n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which is correct as per earlier computation.\n\nYes, so the formula seems solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we have.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me verify it another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 =4\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, that's nine layers, and then the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 +524*3=87000 + 1572=88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. This expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but nested. Let me think about how to model this. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but wait, L_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my formula is off. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches L_3=40. Great, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using the recurrence relation, the nth layer is found to be \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the 9th layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, my initial computation was correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nLet me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29,523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute 29,524*3:\n\n20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524*3 as:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me try another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, since the recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*L_9, where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recursive formula and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is calculated as follows:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) = 88,572$\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the structure, there are nine layers, but the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first parenthesis: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers: Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1+3(1+3) (Layer 2)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (Layer 3)\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) (Layer 4)\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) (Layer 5)\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) (Layer 6)\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) (Layer 7)\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) (Layer 8)\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) (Layer 9)\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write down the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Finally, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric series where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me think if there's a formula for such a series. The general form is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation to verify my step-by-step calculation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572, right? Wait, no, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15: 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2 (from 4*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 5 (from 5*3+1), 8 (from 9*3+1), 8 (from 2*3+2). So, the number is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and both the iterative computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Each step checks out. So, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula. Another way to approach this might be to notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, solving the recurrence relation. But that might be overcomplicating things for someone just starting out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our problem has 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was able to compute it step by step, that's fine too. I think I've got it right. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute it digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me verify by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me double-check because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, then moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, each layer wraps around that. So, let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), which is the second. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), third. Continuing this way, up to the ninth layer, which is the outermost one before the initial 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3 and adding 1.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, we have:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a = 1 and b = 3 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but I need to check the exact formula.\n\nWait, actually, for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence starts at L_1, so let's adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify that the final answer is consistent with the closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is the value of the nth layer. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 1, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
