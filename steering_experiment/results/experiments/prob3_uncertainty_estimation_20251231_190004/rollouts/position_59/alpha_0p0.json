    "text": " Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), it's feasible to compute each one step by step. If there were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a recursive formula to express the nth layer in terms of the previous one. But for this problem, computing each layer manually works fine. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. The expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied multiple times. So, starting with x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = f(x\u2080), x\u2082 = f(x\u2081), and so on up to x\u2088, and then the final result is 3*x\u2088. So, in general, x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is x\u2099 = (3\u207f - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: x\u2081 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Using the formula: (3\u00b9 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, x\u2080 = 1. So, x\u2081 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. x\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's see if the formula x\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works. For n=0: x\u2080 = 1. Formula: (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1: x\u2081 = 4. Formula: (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: x\u2082 = 13. Formula: (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: x\u2083 = 40. Formula: (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula is x\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, starting from x\u2080 up to x\u2088, then x\u2088 = (3^{9} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3\u2079 = 19683. So, x\u2088 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the final result is 3*x\u2088 = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*x\u2088, where x\u2088 is the result after 8 layers. But in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But according to this formula, x\u2088 = (3\u2079 - 1)/2 = 9841, and then 3*x\u2088 = 29523. But that contradicts my earlier result. So, there must be a mistake here. Wait, let me check. When I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I had Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But according to the formula, x\u2088 is 9841, and 3*x\u2088 is 29523. So, which one is correct? Let me check my manual computation again. Starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Wait, but according to the formula, x\u2088 is 9841, which is Layer8. So, the expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula approach is giving me a different answer because I'm misapplying the formula. Wait, the formula x\u2099 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives x\u2088 = (3\u2079 -1)/2 = 9841, which is correct for Layer8. Then, Layer9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula approach is consistent with the manual computation. So, my earlier confusion was because I thought the formula was giving a different answer, but actually, it's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer1:1 +3=4, then Layer2:1 +3*4=13, etc., up to Layer9:29524. So, 3*Layer9=88572. Alternatively, if I consider that each layer is x\u2099 =1 +3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from x\u2080=1, then x\u2081=4, x\u2082=13, etc., up to x\u2088=9841. Then, the outermost expression is 3*x\u2089, where x\u2089=1 +3*x\u2088=1 +3*9841=29524, so 3*x\u2089=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Let me see if that's the case. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might have saved time, but since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that recognizing such patterns can be helpful for more complex problems. In summary, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer n is 1 + 3*a(n-1), where a(n-1) is the previous layer. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, a(1) is 4, a(2)=13, a(3)=40, etc.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a(n) = k*a(n-1) + c is a(n) = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn our case, k=3 and c=1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant B, so substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a(4)= (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result I got by computing each layer step by step. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to express a(n) as a sum.\n\nFrom the recurrence, a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). Unfolding this, we get:\n\na(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a(n-2)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a(n-2)\n\nContinuing this way, after n steps, we have:\n\na(n) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^(n-1) + 3^n*a(0)\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a(1)=4, which is 1 + 3*1=4, so a(0) would be 1, right?\n\nWait, let's see. If n=1, a(1)=1 + 3*a(0). We know a(1)=4, so 4=1 + 3*a(0) => a(0)= (4-1)/3=1.\n\nTherefore, the general formula becomes a(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a(0). But a(0)=1, so:\n\na(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*1 = [ (3^n -1)/ (3 -1) ] + 3^n = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 2*3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, a(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this in multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series sum. All methods lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n3. Identify the recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n4. Use the closed-form expression to compute the value without step-by-step unfolding.\n5. Cross-verify using the geometric series approach to ensure consistency.\n\nAll these steps led me to the same conclusion, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c is the coefficient and d is the constant term. In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Wait, let me check the formula again. The solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 + (d)/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} - d/(1 - c). Wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Let me derive it properly. Let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's take n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula works. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this more quickly. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer without manually calculating each step, which is much faster, especially if there are many layers. But since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad either. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, which matches Layer 2. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let's count again. The innermost is Layer1: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, if we have 9 layers, then Layer9 is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88,572? Wait, let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60,000 9000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, my final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, I think I did it correctly. Each time, I computed the innermost first, then built up each layer. So, I think the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote the value at each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers because the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see. If I consider the expression starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If I expand this, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote S as the innermost expression: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But in our problem, there are nine layers. So, it's a finite geometric series with nine terms. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps the expression can be represented as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but we already solved it using the recursive approach. Alternatively, since we found a closed-form expression, we can rely on that. But just to explore, let's see if we can express S_n as a sum. Let's expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) =1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, again, same result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure no arithmetic errors. Layer 1:1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. 3*29524=88572. Yep, all correct. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. We can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. As we did earlier, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, which we found to be -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4, we found A=3/2. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, all methods lead to the same result. I think I've checked it thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each time you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me find c such that this holds. So, a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Expanding the right side: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c. Setting this equal to 3*a_{n-1} + 3c: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplifying: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. So, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Therefore, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. The initial term b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Thus, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(9*9 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (9*6561 -1)/2. Compute 9*6561: 6561 * 9. Let's compute that: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 +9=59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer, but since the problem has nine layers, it's manageable either way. Either method leads to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

So, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the time constraints, maybe this step-by-step approach is the safest. Another way is to notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, let's write it as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula or a recursive way to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). So, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for L(n) and then multiplied by 3. Let me see: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*L(9) = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Either way, I get the same result. So, that's consistent.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication again because sometimes when we're dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 in another way.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 (carry) = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carry) = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524.\n\nAgain, digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches the earlier calculation, so it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern in the layers and find a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, the final answer is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula using recurrence relations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it down from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8 (thousands), then 5 (hundreds), then 7 (tens), then 2 (units). So, 88572. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nEach time, it's a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. Each set is a new layer. So, Layer1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer9 is the outermost 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each layer step by step because I might have made a mistake in the computations. Let's go through each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, right? 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer8: 3280*3=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 9841*3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), which is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer.\n\nYes, so there are 9 layers. So, my earlier computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^10 is 3 multiplied by itself 10 times:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this problem. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula we derived earlier is a way to shortcut the computation without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. Using the formula is more efficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000; 87000 + 1500 is 88500; 88500 + 60 is 88560; 88560 + 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive pattern. Let me see if there's a formula that could represent this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we find its value is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each time, it's tripling the previous layer and adding 1. This creates a geometric progression, actually. Because each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, in general, the nth term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that this is a geometric series where each term is 3^n times the initial term plus some sum.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So here, c = 3 and d = 1. The initial term a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of n. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since d is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods, computing each layer step by step and using the general formula, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check all my steps because that's a lot of layers, and I don't want to have made a mistake in any of the earlier layers. Let me recount the layers: Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*(a_9) where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. The closed-form solution confirms that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, right? So, each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the process is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, but if I'm considering the layers starting from the innermost, maybe it's better to index them from 1 to 9, where a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. So, the general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Starting at the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Because each time we have a 1+3(, and starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each additional 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3 as Layer 1, then 1+3*(Layer1) as Layer2, up to Layer9 being the outermost one before the initial 3. So that would mean that after computing Layer9, we have to multiply by 3, which is the initial 3 outside. So my earlier calculation is correct: Layer1: 4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me verify this with a different approach because the numbers are growing quite rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error in any layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form formula. The final computation results in the value 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if I consider L_0, it would be 1 + 3*L_{-1}, but maybe it's better to solve for A and B using the recurrence. Alternatively, since the recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So that confirms the answer. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we determine that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 500 + 500 = 1000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, adding the third 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's do this: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 20 = 88568; 88568 + 4 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, Ln = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^(10) -1)/2 ) = (3*(3^10 -1))/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me write it out properly: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carry 1.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. The recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} can be rewritten as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution we found earlier is correct, so I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula or a recursive relation here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, but since it's non-homogeneous (due to the constant term), we'll need to find a particular solution and the homogeneous solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution, a_p. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, 3 * 29524: As above, that's 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as such. Let me think of the expression as follows: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I have n layers, the total would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Alternatively, we can think of this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But perhaps the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here, as I did earlier. Either way, both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think I've thoroughly checked my work, and I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times the expression repeats.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nLet me count the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, there are nine layers, each building on the previous one. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misapplied the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I did it correctly, computing each layer up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for this smaller case, giving 120. So, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, should give the correct result.\n\nTherefore, proceeding as before:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it digit by digit, I might make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that might be a more efficient way. Let me see: 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing all the layers and multiplying by 3, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems correct, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. Let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me recompute the layers quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is just 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, I think I did it right.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series.\n\nLet me think about it. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thought through this thoroughly. Each step makes sense, and the methods cross-check each other. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous expression)}\\). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step.

    "text": " Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carry 0\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n2 + 2 =4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 +4=12 \u21922, carry1\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n0 +5=5\n9 +9=18 \u21928, carry1\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Okay, that matches the earlier result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me go back to the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), and so on, nine times, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers, I started from Layer1 as the innermost, which is 1+3, and Layer9 as the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, that seems right. So, 3 times Layer9 is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check one more time with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's compute Layer9, which is a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, so 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier computation. So, using the recurrence relation method also leads me to the same result, which is reassuring.
