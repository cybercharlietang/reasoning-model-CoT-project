Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so tens digit is 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, so thousands digit is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, so ten-thousands digit is 8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, to verify. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might relate to a geometric series or something similar. Let's consider the general form: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I can compute 3^10 and see if that helps. 3^10 is 59049, as I found earlier. So, using the formula, L9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are 9 layers, starting from 4, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, the total number of layers is 9, so L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, as we saw. Therefore, 3*L9=3*(3^10 -1)/2=(3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) by recognizing that it's a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But in this case, since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it's a bit different. However, using the formula we derived earlier, it's straightforward. So, I think I've verified it enough times to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to make sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so it's a standard problem. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. It's interesting because the formula gives me the same answer, which is reassuring. I guess the key here was recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it to find a closed-form expression, which makes computing the result much faster, especially when dealing with multiple layers. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the recurrence relation and formula, I arrived at the same final answer of 88572. I think that's the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence, we find the result to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the closed-form solution confirms the step-by-step calculation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so thousands place is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, so ten-thousands place is 8. So putting it all together: 88572.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. I think that's correct.

Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit calculation.

But that's conflicting with the part sum method which gave me 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me try again, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, 29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units).

So, Layer 9 is 1 +29,523=29,524, which is correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.

Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, and 29,524 is a bit less, so 88,572 makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers because if I made a mistake in computing the layers, the final answer will be wrong. Let me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought about whether I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...), then another (1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer wraps around the previous one, so total layers are 9. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems right. Hmm, but let me check again the multiplication: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it another way: 29,524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them all up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer 9, I used 3 * 9841 = 29,523, then added 1 to get 29,524. Let me confirm that 3 * 9841 is indeed 29,523.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Correct. So, 3 * 9841 = 29,523, then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, a_3 was 40, etc. Let me see if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where:\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\nwith \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Each a_n can be defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, assuming a constant, is a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Starting from the innermost layer, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The closed-form formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, is a direct result of that. So, using that formula for n=9, we get a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer.

Assume L_n = d, then substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d => d -3d=1 => -2d=1 => d= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can find C using the initial condition. Let's see, the innermost layer is Layer 1: L_1=1+3=4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: L_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it step by step, but I think it's going to get too messy. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, since each layer is L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer individually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to the next term. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2 =1 +3*a_1=1+12=13. a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40. So, in general, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K =3*K +1. Solving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4= C*3^1 -1/2 =>4=3C -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides:4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but because each term is nested, it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation approach helped me find a general formula, which made the computation much easier instead of calculating each layer step by step. So, that's a good takeaway\u2014looking for patterns and trying to find a general formula can save a lot of time, especially with nested expressions like this. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let me add those: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Wait, but each layer is a_n, so E = 3*a_9. And a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the answer directly without computing each layer. That's a bit more efficient, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer 2 = 3*Layer1 + 1 = 3*4 +1=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3=3*Layer2 +1=3*13 +1=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so each Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for Layer n.\n\nGiven the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut for n=9, 3*a_9= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested pattern where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times the next term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:** Each layer \\( a_n \\) is defined as \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Closed-Form Solution:** The general solution for this recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layers:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 29524 \\)\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 8 in the hundreds place, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a recurrence relation here. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. But since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and found the closed-form solution, that gives me confidence in the result. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, n=1: a_1=4. Then layer 2 is n=2:13, etc. Since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 is applied to the 9th layer. Wait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...): There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so each layer corresponds to one set. So, the innermost is layer 1:1+3, then layer 2:1+3*(layer1), up to layer9:1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in the closed-form formula, layer9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern or using a closed-form formula. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, leading to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For nine layers, the result is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. So, the computation seems accurate. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might be faster than computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let's try that approach. The recurrence relation is: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, we can trust it for higher n. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach: expanding the entire expression. However, that might be tedious given the depth of nesting, but perhaps for a few layers, it can be insightful.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost layers:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result again. So, no matter which method I use, the answer seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the computed value is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a geometric series. Let me explore that. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer itself is 1 + 3*(its previous layer), this can be seen as a sum of 3^n terms. Wait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me try to express E in terms of itself, but it's a bit tricky because it's finite. If it were infinite, it would be a geometric series, but since it's finite with nine layers, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for E_n with n layers.\n\nWait, in our earlier approach, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where a_n is the value of the nth layer. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, that would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same result as before. So, another way to express E is (3^{11} - 3)/2. That's a concise formula. Therefore, if I can compute 3^{11}, subtract 3, and then divide by 2, I get the result. Since 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049, and 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to think about it, using the properties of geometric series and exponents. This reinforces the answer again. I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles\u2014step-by-step computation, recurrence relations, and geometric series\u2014and each time, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the answer is correct. It's also a good exercise in recognizing patterns and using different mathematical tools to solve a problem. Sometimes, stepping back and looking for a recurrence relation or a geometric series can save a lot of time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Anyway, I think I've thought this through thoroughly. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nWe verified the result using multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relations, and geometric series.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive pattern, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach, especially since the numbers are manageable. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from 1, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1. Wait, that might not be accurate because each step is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give me the same result.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. For Layer 1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but Layer 1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is incorrect. Let's see. Let's try to find a general formula for Layer n. Let me denote Layer n as L_n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, nine layers deep, then multiplied by 3. By computing each layer step by step, I found Layer 9 to be 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me find A and B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, starting from L_1=4 up to L_9, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but that might take a while. Alternatively, since I have the formula for L_n, I can use that to compute L_9 and then multiply by 3. As I did earlier, that seems efficient. But perhaps I can also consider that the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 / 2 =88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: computing each layer step by step, finding a closed-form formula, and even expressing the entire expression as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (Layer 1), this gives \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Calculating up to Layer 9, we find \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit again. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to get lost. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time it's 1+3 followed by another expression. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost, each layer is built by adding another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I have to compute each layer. From the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. So, that's 9 layers, each one building on the previous. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

    "text": " So, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.

Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, but let me check each step again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I feel like the numbers are growing quite rapidly, so maybe I should check if there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, to save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. This looks like a geometric sequence, but it's actually a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula. Let's see: L1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3*1 + 1 L2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3*1 + 1) + 1 = 3^2*1 + 3*1 + 1 L3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2*1 + 3*1 + 1) + 1 = 3^3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3*1 + 1 L4 = 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 3*(3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Hmm, so each Ln seems to be the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n} plus 1. Wait, let me check that. For L1: n=1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: n=2, sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct. L3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct. So, in general, Ln = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with L1: n=1, (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. L2: n=2, (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. L3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Now, 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series, so the entire expression is a sum that can be expressed using exponents, which allows us to compute it more efficiently without manually calculating each layer. So, to recap, by either computing each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find each layer efficiently. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. Alternatively, using standard multiplication: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So writing it down: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Wait, but let me check: The innermost layer is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more. The outermost layer is Layer 9, so when we compute 3*(Layer 9), that's the total expression.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something. When I was computing each layer, I assumed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). But looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I have to multiply that by 3, which gives 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to do it manually. But just for practice, let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure it's correct. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. Wait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 9 layers inside. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute the result more efficiently without having to compute each layer manually. But since the problem only has nine layers, both methods work fine. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving the recurrence relation, we find a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step isn't too bad.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is a linear recurrence, and solving it using the method I did above. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without too much trouble, that method also works. It's good to know both ways: expanding step by step and finding a general formula.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my step-by-step computation. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, it's like a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Good, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer I got earlier. Alternatively, using the formula, the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a formula involving powers of 3.

Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer computation seems correct. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives us 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Because if I have nine layers, that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but nested. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, maybe I can find a formula for Ln in terms of L(n-1). Each Ln = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence is: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 step by step. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or computations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well, just to double-check. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric progression. Starting from the innermost term: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) Let me denote the entire expression as E. But wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is another similar expression. But since the nesting is finite, it's actually a finite geometric series. Let me see. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to express this as a sum. Let's denote the innermost term as t_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, t_2 = 1 + 3*t_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. Similarly, t_3 =1 +3*t_2=1 +3*13=40, etc., as before. So, in general, t_n =1 +3*t_{n-1}, with t_1=4. So, as I found earlier, t_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, t_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*t_9=88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, each term being 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to see if that's applicable. Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3, but the structure is more nested than a simple geometric series. However, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, maybe I can represent the entire expression in terms of a sum. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let's denote the entire expression as E: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40, etc., as before. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, we get t_9=29524, then E=3*t_9=88572. Alternatively, if I consider the expression as a sum, it's like E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))) with 9 ones. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so it's not exactly a sum of 1's but rather each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sequence is geometric with ratio 3. So, the total expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series with n terms, where n=9. Let me see if that works. The general formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in our case, each term is not just multiplied by 3, but each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, maybe it's not directly applicable, but perhaps I can manipulate it to fit the geometric series formula. Let me try. Let me denote the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Let me expand it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me try to write this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nIf I let x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))), then E = 3*(1 + 3*x). But this seems to complicate things further. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each layer as contributing a power of 3. Let me try writing the expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 +1) =1 + 3*3 + 3*1 =1 + 9 +3=13\n\nWait, 13 can be written as 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? Let's see: 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 1=1, so 9+3+1=13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)=1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40. Now, 40 can be written as 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 +1? Let's check: 27 +9 +3 +1=40. Yes, correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)=1 +3*40=121. 121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1? 81 +27 +9 +3 +1=121. Yes.\n\nSo, it seems that each layer n adds another term to the sum, which is 3^{n} + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 +1.\n\nSo, for layer n, t_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3-1)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, t_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, t_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*t_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, recognizing that each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n, and thus the total expression is 3 times that sum.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to 10, but that might not be accurate because the structure is nested, not a simple sum. Let me check:\n\nIf I expand the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, how does it break down?\n\nEach time we have a 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, expanding E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen E=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, again, same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers, I can represent it as E=3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^9 + 3^{10}. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3 + 3*(3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3 + 3^2 + 3*(3*(1 +...))=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...\n\nContinuing this way, it seems that E=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{10}.\n\nWait, because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding another 3. Let me verify:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3 +3*(3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3 +3^2 +3*(3*(1 +...))=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...\n\nSo, in the end, E=3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{10}.\n\nSo, that's a geometric series with first term a=3, ratio r=3, and number of terms n=10.\n\nSo, the sum S= a*(r^n -1)/(r-1)=3*(3^{10}-1)/(3-1)=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, by recognizing that the entire expression E is the sum of a geometric series from 3^1 to 3^{10}, which sums up to 88572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014the result is the same: 88572.\n\nI think I've covered multiple methods to solve this problem, and all lead to the same answer. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using different techniques to ensure that the solution is correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
