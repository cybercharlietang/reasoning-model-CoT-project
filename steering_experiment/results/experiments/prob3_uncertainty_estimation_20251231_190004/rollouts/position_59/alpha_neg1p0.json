    "text": " Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because that's a lot of layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation here is linear, and it's of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution is L_n = (L_0 - c)/(1 - a) * a^n + c, where c is a constant. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's proceed. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine each layer's value step by step. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It's easy to get lost in the layers.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume that the steady-state solution is a constant C, so substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recursive formula: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, since the outermost layer is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*3^{10}=3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients, the solution is a_n = A*r^n + B, where r is the root of the characteristic equation. In this case, the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nNow, to find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the particular solution. The particular solution is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistakes in the exponentiation or division. 3^10 is indeed 59049, as 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40,000, 200*43=8,600, 43*200=8,600, 43*43=1,849. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 243*243: 200*200=40,000; 200*43=8,600; 43*200=8,600; 43*43=1,849. So adding those: 40,000 + 8,600 + 8,600 + 1,849. 40,000 + 8,600 = 48,600; 48,600 + 8,600 = 57,200; 57,200 + 1,849 = 59,049. So yes, 3^10 is 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, perhaps I can derive the same result. Each layer is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, when expanded, the entire expression would be a sum of 3^k terms. Wait, let's see: Let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, if I expand it all the way, the expression would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to express this as a sum. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAs before, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can see that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, as I solved earlier.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds, and for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as a sum, each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 can be seen as building up powers of 3.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that each layer adds another term in a geometric progression. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let x be the innermost expression, x = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*x, where x is the previous layer. So, if I have nine layers, it's like x_1 = 1 + 3, x_2 = 1 + 3*x_1, x_3 = 1 + 3*x_2, ..., x_9 = 1 + 3*x_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9.\n\nBut I already computed this as 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand all the layers, each layer contributes a term that is 3^k, where k is the number of layers from that point to the end.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of multiplications by 3 each term undergoes.\n\nFor example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times before being added to the other terms.\n\nSimilarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3 zero times.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the outermost parentheses would be the sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 8, each multiplied by 1, plus the contributions from the multiplications.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to a geometric series where each term is 3^k, but let me see.\n\nWait, if I have nine layers, each starting with 1, and each being multiplied by 3 successively, then the total expression inside the outermost parentheses would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, but each term is multiplied by 1, and then the entire sum is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because each 1 is nested within multiple layers, so each 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. Each 1 in the expression is being multiplied by 3 as many times as the number of layers it's nested within. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times, the next one seven times, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3 zero times.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841. Wait, but that's the value of a_8, which we computed earlier as 9,841. Then, the outermost parentheses is 3*(a_9), which is 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*9,841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that aligns with our previous calculation.\n\nWait, but when I thought of the sum as sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, that gives (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9,841, which is a_8. Then, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but that might not directly apply because each 1 is being nested within the expressions, so each 1 is being multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series where each term is 1 multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers it's nested within.\n\nSo, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the outermost parentheses would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9,841. Then, adding 1 more 1 and multiplying by 3 gives us a_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524, and then the total expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^10 minus some constant, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each time I have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to 3*(...) + 1. So, each layer is 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous + 1.\n\nSo, the sequence goes: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this in multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake when dealing with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about the structure. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is a linear recurrence. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute the nth term directly, which could save time if I have to compute many layers. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). If I expand it, maybe I can express it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the innermost layers first. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k, from k=0 to k=n, but adjusted somehow. Let me see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Wait, but 3^4 is 81, so (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Similarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. So, in general, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is the same as the solution to the recurrence relation I found earlier. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer checks out. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute it without calculating each layer, but since I've already computed each layer step by step, and each step seems correct, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive formula. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this recursive approach is consistent with my earlier calculations. Since the problem has 9 layers, we're looking for a_9, and then multiplying by 3. So, a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I also get 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Then, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, then the total expression is 3*L9. Let's see if there's a recursive formula here. Let me define L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Therefore, the total is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could model this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution can be found using standard techniques. Here, a = 3, b = 1. The general solution is L(n) = C*(a)^n + (b)/(1 - a), but since a = 3 > 1, the homogeneous solution would be C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me solve it properly. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. Let me find the homogeneous solution first: The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carry.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Let me verify using another method: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88572. But let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer.\n\nWait, let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

(1+3(\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each corresponding to Layer 1 through Layer 9. So, I correctly computed each layer from 1 to 9, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the final answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^10 again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form solution both give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let's see. The expression is a nested multiplication, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again. Is there a formula for this kind of expression? It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I might be able to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = C*a^{n} + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is the particular solution when the recurrence is in steady state.\n\nTo find d, we set L_n = d = a*d + b.\n\nSo, d = 3d + 1.\n\nSolving for d: d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because all our layers so far have been positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in our case, L_1 = 4. So, perhaps n starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers we've already computed.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Applying this formula, we compute the innermost layers step by step and then proceed outward, eventually finding the value of the entire expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). This can be represented as \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer \\(L_n\\) is defined by the recurrence relation:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the innermost layer \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **General Solution:**\n   The recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous equation.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more quickly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check. So, the answer is 88,572. Therefore, the problem is solved correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel good about this solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed before, a_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since this recurrence is a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}/2 - 1/2) = 3*(59049/2 - 1/2) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors because I double-checked each step, and the closed-form formula confirmed the result. So, yeah, that's how I would solve this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce the chance of errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + r*(...))) with n layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by r. The value of such an expression can be found using the formula: S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, each term is 1, and r is 3. But let me check if that formula applies here. Wait, actually, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so it's a bit different. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But since the inner expression is similar to E itself, except that it's one layer less. Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for E_n would be E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4. When n=1, E_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: E_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our case, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the original expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of errors. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...).

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, I think I did it right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied to make it easier. Let's see, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the final answer is 3 * 29524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L_9 directly, which would have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was working it out manually, step by step was the way to go. I think that's all I can do here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, maybe recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 3*(previous layer) + 1. As we saw, that's a linear recurrence. Alternatively, maybe writing out the expression as a sum: Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to express this in terms of E itself, but I'm not sure if that's feasible because each layer is similar but not the same as E. Wait, actually, E is the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, maybe E can be expressed in terms of a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to write out the expression in expanded form. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Wait, that seems to be a pattern. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but let's check: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 = (3^2 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, in general, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly what we found earlier using the recurrence relation. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. The sum inside each layer is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. The sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, both methods confirm the same result. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at Layer 9 being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allowed me to compute Layer 9 directly using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, leading to the same result. So, I think I've covered all the steps and verified the answer in multiple ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

That seems correct. Each step, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a geometric progression, perhaps? Let me think about that. If I consider each layer as a term in a sequence, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c is the coefficient and d is the constant. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(c-1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. So, plugging in, a_n = A*3^n + (1/(3-1)) = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 0.5 => 3A = 3.5 => A = 3.5/3 = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/2) + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me check my steps again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The standard solution method: The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula: For n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, substituting A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times, both by step-by-step computation and by using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, a closed-form formula is derived using a recurrence relation, confirming the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n2. Use the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n3. Derive the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n4. For the outermost layer (n=9), compute \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n5. Multiply by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if I messed up any layer, the subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost part up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so let's count them: Starting after the first 3(, the first inner expression is 1+3(...). Each time we have a new 1+3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 1+3( is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Because each time you go into a new set of parentheses, that's another layer. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), which leads to c = 1/(3 - 1) = 1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular, which would be a_n = A*3^{n} + 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 1/2 => 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => A = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (7/6)*3^{n} + 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. That suggests that my general formula might be incorrect. Let me double-check the recurrence solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it step by step. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the correct general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as I had earlier. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So the number is 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) \u00d7 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So 476 \u00d7 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572.

So Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply Layer 9 by 3: 88572. Each step seems correct, and the multiplication at the end also checks out. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which resembles a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. The expression has 9 layers, so n=9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing a9 where a1=4 and a_n=1+3*a_{n-1} for n>=2. Now, solving such a recurrence relation, I can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n-1}*(a1 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m, the solution is a_n = k^{n}*(a0) + m*(k^{n-1} + k^{n-2} + ... + k^0). Wait, but in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, m=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a0) + (3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^0). Wait, but in our case, a1 = 4, so maybe the initial term is a1=4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had 9 layers, step-by-step computation was manageable. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n4. Verify the computations using an alternative method (breaking down the multiplication) to ensure accuracy.\n5. Realize that the recurrence relation could be modeled with a formula, which was then used to confirm the result.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572.

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, write 0, carry 1. 9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1. 2+2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048. Now, add 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7, write 7. 0+5=5, write 5. 9+9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. So, 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go back through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3 =4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step seems manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, recursively, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 =4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine terms, computing each step is feasible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the equation: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, the value is a_k=(3^{k+1}-1)/2. So, layer 9 would be a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's a good way to verify the answer. So, the problem is solved correctly, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000? Wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it differently. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check the computations another way. Let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series or a recurrence relation here. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, starting from L_1=4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which in this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). Let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + (b/(a-1))*(a^{n} - 1). Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution is C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it step by step. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning or computations. So, yeah, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric sequence. The general formula for a_n in such a case is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to find a pattern from the layers I computed: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Let me see if there's a pattern in these numbers. Let's compute the ratios between successive terms: a2/a1 = 13/4 = 3.25 a3/a2 = 40/13 \u2248 3.077 a4/a3 = 121/40 = 3.025 a5/a4 = 364/121 \u2248 3.008 a6/a5 = 1093/364 \u2248 3.003 a7/a6 = 3280/1093 \u2248 3.0009 a8/a7 = 9841/3280 \u2248 3.0000 a9/a8 = 29524/9841 \u2248 3.0000 So, as n increases, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so as n becomes large, a_n \u2248 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression with ratio 3. But for finite n, each term is slightly more than 3 times the previous term. So, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/2. Let me test this: For n=1: (3^{2} +1)/2 = (9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. But a1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe (3^{n} - 1)/2: For n=1: (3 -1)/2=1, not 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps (3^{n+1} - 1)/2: For n=1: (9 -1)/2=4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (27 -1)/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=40, which matches a3=40. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=121, which matches a4=121. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=364, which matches a5=364. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093, which matches a6=1093. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280, which matches a7=3280. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841, which matches a8=9841. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524, which matches a9=29524. Oh, so the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's interesting. So, in general, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as I found before. So, the step-by-step process is correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum. The innermost term is 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression would give us a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But since I already have a formula for a_n, I think that's sufficient. Just to recap, the layers go from a1 to a9, each defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a1=4. Using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, I can compute a9 directly, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the formula**: Each layer a_n can be computed using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which confirms the computed values up to Layer 9.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this nested expression so I don't have to compute each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for L_n, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have L_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, let's compute L_9.\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify the calculations once more to be thorough.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Compute each nested layer from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another approach. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1. So, we can compute each L_n step by step, which is what I did earlier. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B =4. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 =1 + 3*L_1 =1 + 3*4=13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B =9A + B=13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B =4 and 9A + B=13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Now, substituting A=1.5 into the first equation: 3*(1.5) + B=4 =>4.5 + B=4 =>B=4 -4.5= -0.5. So the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n - 0.5. Simplifying, L_n= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that also gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be generalized, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find D first. To find the steady-state solution, set a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Then, D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, I'll compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but using the recurrence relation and the formula made it manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 helped in finding a closed-form solution, which is always nice because it saves time and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors when dealing with many layers. But even without that, step-by-step computation worked well enough for nine layers. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
