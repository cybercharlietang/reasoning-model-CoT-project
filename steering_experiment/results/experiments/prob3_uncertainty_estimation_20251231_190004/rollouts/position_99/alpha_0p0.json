    "text": " Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but in our case, n is finite. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation. Good, so the formula works. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized the recurrence relation and found a closed-form formula to compute it more efficiently. Both approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer can be computed using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 as per the original expression yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing this to the general solution a_n = A*3^n + B, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result.

    "text": " Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13.

Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572.

So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

    "text": " Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B, then a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

    "text": " Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, but this time, perhaps using substitution or another method. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer and then multiply by 3 at the end. Wait, no, the 3 is outside all the layers, so it's only multiplied once after computing the entire nested expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent each layer as a number and then compute each step. Let me try that again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a sum: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence method is the most straightforward here. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost term, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Each time, the coefficient of 1 increases by a factor of 3. Wait, perhaps I can express the entire nested expression as a sum. Let me consider that each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, since there are 8 layers above it. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Similarly, the 3s in each term are multiplied by 3^{k-1}, but perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me try to write it out. The entire expression inside the outermost 3 is: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote this as E. So, E = 1 + 3*E1, where E1 is the next nested expression. But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write E as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Since each time, the expression repeats, it's similar to an infinite series, but in this case, it's finite with 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a finite geometric series. From the recurrence relation, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, this method also confirms the answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using a different approach. Let me try to compute the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, using a table:\n\nLayer | Expression | Value\n-----|------------|------\n1    | 1 + 3      | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*(Layer1)| 1 + 12 =13\n3    | 1 + 3*(Layer2)| 1 + 39 =40\n4    | 1 + 3*(Layer3)| 1 + 120=121\n5    | 1 + 3*(Layer4)| 1 + 363=364\n6    | 1 + 3*(Layer5)| 1 + 1092=1093\n7    | 1 + 3*(Layer6)| 1 + 3279=3280\n8    | 1 + 3*(Layer7)| 1 + 9840=9841\n9    | 1 + 3*(Layer8)| 1 + 29523=29524\nFinal| 3*(Layer9) | 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous value). This seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Therefore, I think the answer is definitely 88572. Alternatively, to ensure no calculation errors, perhaps I can compute the final multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we get 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is essentially a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. The innermost term is 4, which is 3 + 1. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. The next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(3 + 1)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's interesting. It seems like each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to a certain power of 3. Let me explore that.\n\nAt Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*(9 + 3 + 1) = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*(27 + 9 + 3 + 1) = 1 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, so each layer n seems to be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Because the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. This further confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(9 + 3 + 1) = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40\nAnd so on, each time adding the next higher power of 3. So, by the time we reach layer 9, the value is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Wait, that's 10 terms. Let me sum them up:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n4 + 9 = 13\n13 + 27 = 40\n40 + 81 = 121\n121 + 243 = 364\n364 + 729 = 1093\n1093 + 2187 = 3280\n3280 + 6561 = 9841\n9841 + 19683 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. This aligns with all previous methods. Therefore, I'm absolutely certain that the answer is 88572.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, solving it using the closed-form formula for a geometric series, and verifying through multiple methods, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer step by step. Each layer follows the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2, and so on up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

    "text": " Let's find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging into the equation: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, it's clear that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, solving the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.
