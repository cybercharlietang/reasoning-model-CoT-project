Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence starting from a_1. Let me try to find a pattern. Compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*(3^n) + D, where D is a constant. To find C and D, we can use the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 \u21d2 A = 9/6 = 3/2.

So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, assume a constant a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.

So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can use the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for a_9, which is layer 9, we have a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually was feasible, though a bit time-consuming. I think I've got the correct answer here, 88572. Let me just double-check my multiplication to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx   3\n-------\nStart from the right:\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Also, for n=0, we can think of a_0 as the base case, but since our expression starts at n=1, maybe it's better to adjust the formula. Alternatively, the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a standard linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me set up the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assume solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.

No, 3^1 + 1 = 4, which matches. a_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13. a_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 13 = 27 + 13 = 40. a_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 40 = 81 + 40 = 121.

Alternatively, we can express a_n as a_n = (a_1 - B)*3^{n-1} + B. Wait, perhaps it's better to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Therefore: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that seems like each layer is adding another term in the geometric series with ratio 3. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is exactly what we found earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, we could have used the formula from the start, but computing each layer step by step was manageable and helped confirm the result. I think this makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer and apply it to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times layer 9. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's see if we can find A and B. For n=1: 4 = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 4 = 3A + B and 13 = 9A + B. Subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Plugging in a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, perhaps a_0 would be 1, but let's check. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Then, using the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in n=0: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B => 1 = A + B. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3 + B. So we have two equations: 1) A + B = 1 2) 3A + B = 4 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then from equation 1: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the outermost layer is a_9, and then we multiply by 3. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.
