Plugging into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that seems fractional, but our a_n are integers, so maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try a particular solution as a constant C. So, assume a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly found a_9 and then multiplied by 3, which gives the same result. So, that's another way to approach it, but since the number of layers is manageable, computing step by step is feasible.

So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. To solve this recurrence, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.

So perhaps the base case is a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then the general solution for a_n would be a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_0 = 1: a_0 = A*3^0 - 1/2 = A - 1/2 = 1 => A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value. But from our earlier calculations, all the a_n are integers. So perhaps this approach is missing something. Alternatively, maybe the recurrence is slightly different. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, etc., as before. So, perhaps the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression, after 9 layers, is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form expression. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is the same: 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just double-check my multiplication for 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3.

Now, to find a closed-form solution for a_n, let's consider the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.

Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to find the solution. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd because all the terms we computed are integers. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, a5=1+3*121=364, a6=1+3*364=1093, a7=1+3*1093=3280, a8=1+3*3280=9841, a9=1+3*9841=29524. So, each term is an integer, so a_n must be integer for all n. But according to my previous calculation, B = -1/2, which would make a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. But that would mean a_n is not an integer unless A*3^n is a half-integer, which contradicts the fact that a_n is integer. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Substituting into the equation: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, yes, the recurrence is working as expected. To find a closed-form, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gave me 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Additionally, I verified using a recurrence relation and found a closed-form formula, which also led me to the same result.

So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

Then, the entire original expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. I can also think of this as each layer multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since I already have the formula, I can rely on it to compute the result without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step was feasible. Alternatively, if I were to code this, I could write a loop that starts from the innermost layer and works its way out, updating the value each time by computing 1 + 3*current_value. But for now, since it's only nine layers, doing it manually is manageable. Let me just verify once more by computing a few layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 4: (3^{5} -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is consistent.

Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern immediately, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a linear recurrence, and solving that gives a closed-form expression. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is feasible. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer.

So, the general solution for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see: For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step, which I did, and it worked out. So, I think that's solid.

Let me see if these numbers correspond to a known sequence or if I can find a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, recognizing that each layer follows a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = A*3^n + B. To find A and B, we can plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. To find another equation, let's compute a2 using the recurrence: a2 = 3*a1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: a2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.
