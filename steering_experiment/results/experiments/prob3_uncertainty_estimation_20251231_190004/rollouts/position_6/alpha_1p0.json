    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last set of parentheses, which is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. \n\nSo, $1 + 3 = 4$. That was easy. Now, moving one step out, the next part is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Wait, but in this case, the something is the result we just got, which is 4. So, let me write that down.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let's compute that. First, I need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives me 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{something})$. The something here is the previous result, which is 13. So, let's compute that.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 13$. Again, multiplication first: 3 times 13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is $1 + 3 \\times 40$. Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 121$. Hmm, 3 times 121 is... let me think. 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, that's 364.\n\nWait, hold on, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, each step is: current value = 1 + 3 * previous value. So, let me try to list these out step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$.\n3. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$.\n4. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$.\n5. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$.\n6. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$.\n7. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$.\n8. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$.\n9. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$.\n10. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573$.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I went too far. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, let's see: each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), that's the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) sections:\n\n1. First layer: 3(1+3(...))\n2. Second layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n3. Third layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n4. Fourth layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n5. Fifth layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n6. Sixth layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n7. Seventh layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n8. Eighth layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n9. Ninth layer: inside that, 1+3(...)\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...) inside each other. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3. Then each layer is built on top of that.\n\nSo, when I computed up to 88573, that was the ninth layer. But wait, the expression is 3 times that ninth layer. So, actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer result. So, I think I went one step too far.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the first layer, which is 1 + 3 times the second layer, and so on. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me list the layers correctly:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 1, which is 3*4=12? Wait, no, that can't be right because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 1). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to write down the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B)), where B is (1 + 3*(C)), and so on until the innermost which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*previous). So, let me list each step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*L9, right? Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(L1), where L1 is the innermost. Wait, that doesn't make sense because L1 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer is built on top.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because Layer 9 is the outermost layer. Wait, no, the structure is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, we have 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). No, wait, no. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), which is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), etc., until Layer 9 is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try to visualize the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing Layer 9, we have 29524. But the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because Layer 9 is the outermost layer. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is the innermost. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Layer 1 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer is built on top. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), etc., up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, Layer 9 is the innermost, and Layer 1 is the outermost. So, I was counting them in reverse. So, starting from the innermost as Layer 9, then moving outwards.\n\nSo, let me recount:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nCompute 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\nCompute 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\nCompute 20 * 3 = 60\n\nCompute 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n--------\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...), right? So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after computing up to Layer 1, which is the outermost, we get 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. This seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's find the equilibrium solution first. Assume a_n = C.\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Starting from the innermost as layer 1, and building up to layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, in our case, the innermost is layer 1: a_1 = 4 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. That checks out.\n\nThen, layer 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. That's correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, generalizing, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for the outermost layer, which is layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we can recognize the pattern as a recurrence relation where each layer is of the form $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, starting from the innermost layer. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Subsequent Layers:**  \n   Each layer is computed as $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$.  \n   - Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$  \n   - Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$  \n   - Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$  \n   - Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$  \n   - Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$  \n   - Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$  \n   - Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$  \n   - Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\n3. **Final Computation:**  \n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:  \n   $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the one inside it.\n\nSo, let me try to write down the expression more clearly. It's a series of 1+3(...) multiplied by 3 each time. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: the innermost is (1+3), then it's 1+3*(that), then another 1+3*(the next one), and so on, until there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me check how many times 3 is being multiplied. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each time it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so maybe it's eight layers? Wait, no, let me count again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside that, there's another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let's see:\n\n1. The outermost 3\n2. Then inside, 3*(...)\n3. Then another 3*(...)\n4. And this continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so how many 3s are there as multipliers? Let me count the number of times 3 is written as a factor. From the expression, after each opening parenthesis, there's a 3, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3s is as follows: the first 3, then each time inside, another 3, so that's 1, then 2, up to 9? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time there's a new 3, it's another layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each time inside, another 3, so how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s as multipliers. The first one is the outermost 3, then each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(...)\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(...)\n3. So, continuing until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so how many layers? Let's see: the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer1), that's layer2, then layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on until we have 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of 3s as multipliers. Let me see: the expression is written as 3 followed by 8 more 3s inside the parentheses, so that's 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9, right? Because each time I have a new ( after a 3, except the last one which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each time a new 3 is inside, so how many 3s? Let's count them:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then inside, another 3\n3. Then another 3\n4. Another 3\n5. Another 3\n6. Another 3\n7. Another 3\n8. Another 3\n9. Another 3\n\nWait, that's 9 3s in total, but the innermost is just 1+3, so maybe it's 8 layers? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out. So, let's define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 is (1 + 3). Then L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Then L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), and so on until L9, which is the outermost expression. Wait, but in the given problem, the outermost expression is 3*(L8), where L8 is 1 + 3*(L7), etc. Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, the given expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(L1), which is L2. Then, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), and so on, up to L9, which is 1 + 3*(L8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the total expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on.\n\nSo, if I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1, then L2, up to L9, and then multiply the final result by 3, that should give me the answer.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 + 1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 + 1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 + 2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large, and I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nLet me verify L9 again: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nAnother way: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, expanding step by step seems manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: this expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can express it in terms of a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, same result as before. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014iterative expansion and finding a closed-form solution\u2014we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times to ensure accuracy. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and verifying each part helps prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is defined as \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). \n\n1. **Layer 1 (L1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2 (L2):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3 (L3):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4 (L4):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5 (L5):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6 (L6):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7 (L7):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8 (L8):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9 (L9):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write it down as I go.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So now, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that part is 40.\n\nNext layer out, we have 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, that's 364.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer out, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me calculate 3*88573. Hmm, 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by all that. So, after computing the innermost part and working outwards, I ended up with 265720, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, actually, when I was computing each layer, I think I included the multiplication by 3 each time. Let me make sure I didn't miss that.\n\nWait, no, maybe I did it correctly. Let me recount. Each time, I took the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each step was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, by the time I reached the outermost layer, I had 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720. Then, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Wait, no, because the outermost part is 3*(...). Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try again, more carefully. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each time multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I went through 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, I got to 265720, which would be the result inside the outermost 3(...). So, then the total expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I thought that the final result after 9 layers was 265720, which is the value inside the outermost 3(...). So, then the entire expression is 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*265720: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, the final result would be 797160.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier, when I computed each layer, I ended up with 265720 as the result of the innermost 1 + 3*(...), and then I thought that was the entire expression, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(that). So, perhaps I made a miscalculation there.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me recount the layers. Each time, I compute 1 + 3*(previous result), and I did that 9 times, starting from (1 + 3). So, each step was:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nWait, that's 11 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers inside. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is followed by another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe outermost is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections inside.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each new ( starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n10. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, we have (1 + 3) = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to 9 layers. So, perhaps I went one layer too far earlier.\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers, then the computation should be done 9 times, starting from (1 + 3). Let me redo that, step by step, carefully.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, this is the result inside the outermost 3(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems different from my earlier result. Wait, in my initial calculation, I thought I had 10 layers, which led me to 265720, but now, correctly counting 9 layers, I get 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Wait, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so the correct total would be 88572. But earlier, when I thought I had 10 layers, I ended up with 265720, but that must have been incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's a (, then inside that, another 3(, and so on. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears inside.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, each time we have a 3 followed by (, so:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 times. Therefore, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, my initial calculation of 9 layers leading to 29524, then 3*29524=88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought I had 11 layers, I got 265720, but that was a mistake because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure by computing each layer again step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, perhaps I should check if I have to multiply by 3 again. Let me confirm:\n\nThe original problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part after the first 3* is the 9-layer expression we computed as 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier calculation where I thought it was 265720. That must have been a miscalculation because I went one layer too deep, thinking there were 10 layers instead of 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem differently, using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series. But in our case, it's a finite nested expression with 9 layers. So, perhaps I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's compute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 terms, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another approach. Maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the indexing is a bit different. Let me check.\n\nWait, if n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4, then the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nPlugging in n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After evaluating each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29,524.

    "text": " Maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a logical strategy because each part depends on the result of the inner part.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Since the innermost was 4, the next one would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep track of each step to make sure I don't get lost. So far, I've done three layers: 4, 13, 40. Let me see how many layers there are in total. Counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe nine layers in total. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the first innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly. Each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have nine layers, I should compute nine times. Let me recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so after nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3*(that result). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this 29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me write it out:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 2 = 59048, then add 29524 to get 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers or make a miscalculation in the intermediate steps. Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Then the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, right? Let me confirm. Starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation. It seems consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, earlier I wrote 1 + 3*40 = 121, but 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer checks out. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've considered both the step-by-step approach and the general formula approach, and they both lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n2. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by working from the inside out. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is $1+3$. That's straightforward. So, $1+3$ is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Wait, let me clarify. Each level seems to be of the form $1 + 3(\\text{previous expression})$. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to number each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. So, layer 1 is $1+3$, layer 2 is $1 + 3(\\text{layer 1})$, and so on until layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, there are nine layers because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...), so yeah, nine layers in total.\n\nSo, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's list them out:\n\nLayer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nLayer 2: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4$\n\nLayer 3: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}$\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}$\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. So, after computing Layer 9, we'll have $3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}$. Hmm, so maybe the process is: compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, that's simple.\n\nLayer 2: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nWait, that seems right.\n\nLayer 3: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nLayer 4: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\nLayer 5: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\nLayer 6: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication: 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, 4 times 3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nWait, 3 times 1093: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nWait, 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nWait, let me check that. 3 times 9841: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, 1 times 3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 times 29524. So, let me compute that.\n\n3 times 29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3 times 20000 is 60000.\n\n3 times 9000 is 27000.\n\n3 times 500 is 1500.\n\n3 times 20 is 60.\n\n3 times 4 is 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 times 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe using standard multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer's computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me see.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*(r)^n + D, where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case, and D is a constant.\n\nWait, but let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Hmm, maybe that's the case here.\n\nWait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c is 1, r is 3, and a_1 is 4. So, perhaps the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*a_1 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1. Wait, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the solution as a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation using the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B.\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1.\n\nEquate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nHmm, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing a pattern in the nested expressions. Each layer follows the form $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, starting from $a_1 = 4$. The solution to this recurrence relation is given by:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nFor $n = 9$, we find:\n\n$a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: $1+3$. That's straightforward. $1 + 3$ equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Since the innermost something is 4, the next part would be $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that: $3 \\times 4$ is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, the next level out is 13.\n\nNow, moving another level out, the expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$ again. The something here is 13, so I compute $3 \\times 13$, which is 39, and then add 1. That gives me 40. So, now I'm at 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is $1 + 3(40)$. Let me compute that: $3 \\times 40$ is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. So, that's 121.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is $1 + 3(121)$. Calculating that: $3 \\times 121$ is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. So, now I have 364.\n\nNext level out: $1 + 3(364)$. Let me compute that: $3 \\times 364$ is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nContinuing, the next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Hmm, $3 \\times 1093$ is... let me see, 1000 times 3 is 3000, and 93 times 3 is 279, so adding those together gives 3279. Then, adding 1, that's 3280.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1093 times 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, that's correct. So, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Okay, so that level is 3280.\n\nMoving another level out, we have $1 + 3(3280)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 3280. Hmm, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me compute 3 times 9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because 9841 is a large number. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nMoving outward again, the expression is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let's compute that. 29524 times 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 88572 + 1 is 88573. Correct.\n\nNext, the expression is $1 + 3(88573)$. Let me compute that. 88573 times 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 265719 + 1 is 265720. Correct.\n\nMoving outward, the expression is $1 + 3(265720)$. Let me compute that. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 797160 + 1 is 797161. Correct.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost expression, which is $3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 797161. So, I need to compute 3 times 797161. Let me do that: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure. 797161 * 3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes because this is a long computation and it's easy to slip up somewhere.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Finally: 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nWait, so that's 13 steps. Let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting with 1+3=4 (step 1). Then each subsequent step adds another layer, so from 4 up to 13 layers. So, I think I accounted for each layer correctly.\n\nLet me check a couple of the middle steps again to be sure.\n\nFor example, step 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 1 + 3*88573. 3*88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. Correct.\n\nStep 13: 3*797161. 797161*3 is 2391483. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 2,391,483.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without doing each step manually, which is error-prone.\n\nI notice that each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many levels do we have here? Let's see: starting from the innermost 1+3, which is level 1, and working outwards, each set of parentheses adds another level. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3( : there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9. Therefore, n = 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, the value before the final multiplication was 797161, which is 3*265720 + 1, but according to the closed-form, a_9 is 29524. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each additional 1+3(...) adds a level. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the outermost: 3(1+3(...)) which has 9 levels of 1+3(...). So, n=9.\n\nBut according to the closed-form, a_9 = 29524, but when I computed step by step, the outermost expression was 3*(797161) = 2391483, which would correspond to a_10? Wait, perhaps the indexing is off by one.\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step, I had 13 steps, but perhaps each step corresponds to a level. Let me see:\n\nStarting with level 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nLevel 10: 1+3*29524=88573\n\nLevel 11: 1+3*88573=265720\n\nLevel 12: 1+3*265720=797161\n\nLevel 13: 3*797161=2391483\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is at level 13, but the closed-form formula I derived was for n levels starting from 1. So, if n=9 corresponds to 29524, but in reality, the outermost expression is at level 13, meaning n=13. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption about the number of levels was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's recount the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the outermost 3(...):\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3( [1+3(...) ] )\n\nInside that, it's 1+3( [1+3(...)] )\n\nCounting each time we have 1+3(...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n...\nHow many times does 1+3(...) appear? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as level 1, each layer adds another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, the first 1+3( is level 1, then each subsequent ( adds another level. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3(:\n\nLooking at the string: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nThe number of opening parentheses after the first 3( is 9. Each corresponds to a new level. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 13 levels, which suggests that perhaps I miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps the closed-form formula is for a different indexing.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 applies when starting from n=0. Let me check.\n\nIf n=0, a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which would correspond to the innermost 1+3=4? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is off by one.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the closed-form formula I derived earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches my step-by-step.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nSo, indeed, a_n corresponds to the value after n levels. Therefore, in the original problem, how many levels are there?\n\nLooking back, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 levels of 1+3(...). So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 2,391,483, which is 3*797161, and 797161 is a_12 in the sequence because I had 13 steps. So, perhaps the confusion is that the outermost 3*(...) is an additional step beyond the a_n sequence.\n\nWait, in the closed-form, a_n is the value inside the 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*a_n. So, if the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), then the total value is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my step-by-step result. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of levels. Let me try to map the step-by-step to the closed-form.\n\nIn my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. a_1 = 4\n2. a_2 = 13\n3. a_3 = 40\n4. a_4 = 121\n5. a_5 = 364\n6. a_6 = 1093\n7. a_7 = 3280\n8. a_8 = 9841\n9. a_9 = 29524\n10. a_10 = 88573\n11. a_11 = 265720\n12. a_12 = 797161\n13. a_13 = 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nBut according to the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_1=4=(3^2 -1)/2=4, correct.\n\na_2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\na_3=40=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\na_4=121=(3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\na_5=364=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\na_6=1093=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\na_7=3280=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\na_8=9841=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\na_9=29524=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\na_10=88573=(3^{11} -1)/2=177146/2=88573, correct.\n\na_11=265720=(3^{12} -1)/2=531440/2=265720, correct.\n\na_12=797161=(3^{13} -1)/2=1594322/2=797161, correct.\n\na_13=3*797161=2391483.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), because the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 levels of 1+3(...). Therefore, the total value is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, in my step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which is 3*a_12. So, there's a mismatch here. Why?\n\nAh, I think I see the confusion. The original problem is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 levels of 1+3. So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I continued beyond a_9, computing up to a_13=797161, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2391483. That suggests that I miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of 1+3(...) expressions in the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the outermost 3(...):\n\n1. The first 1+3(...) is level 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(...) is level 2.\n\nContinuing this way, each additional 1+3(...) adds a new level.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen,\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to the outermost: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost as level 1, each subsequent layer adds another level. The expression has 9 sets of 1+3(...) inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, n=9.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3(...) is a_9=29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went beyond that, computing up to a_13=797161, which suggests that I miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the outermost 3(...) is level 10, making n=10. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the structure is:\n\n3(1+3(...))\n\nWhere the ... contains 8 more 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is 9 levels of 1+3(...), making n=9. So, the outermost is 3*(a_9), so the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to 3*(a_12)=2391483, which would mean that the original problem has 12 levels, but that doesn't match the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of 1+3(...) in the original problem.\n\nLet me write the expression with parentheses:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each additional 1+3(...) adds one more level.\n\nSo, the number of 1+3(...) is 9, from level 1 to level 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which suggests that I must have miscounted the number of levels. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the closed-form formula gives a_n as the value at each level, and the total expression is a_{n+1}.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf I have a recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThen, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc.\n\nIn the original problem, the structure is 3*(a_9), because there are 9 levels of 1+3(...).\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed up to 3*(a_12)=2391483, which suggests that I have 12 levels. Therefore, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels in the original problem.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 1+3(...) expressions in the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the outermost 3(...):\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3( [1+3(...)] )\n\nInside that:\n\n1+3( [1+3(...)] )\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3(...) appears:\n\n1. The first 1+3(...) is at the first level.\n\n2. Inside that, another 1+3(...) is level 2.\n\n3. Inside that, level 3.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nHow many times does 1+3(...) appear? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\nThe expression after the initial 3( is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 9, which corresponds to 9 levels of 1+3(...). Therefore, n=9.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went beyond that, computing up to a_13=797161, which suggests that I must have miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by considering the outermost 3*(...) as part of the a_n sequence, but actually, a_n is the value inside the 3*(...). Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed up to 3*(a_12)=2391483, which suggests that I have 12 levels, but according to the structure, it's only 9 levels.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step counting. Let me recount the levels carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4 (level 1)\n\n2. 1+3*4=13 (level 2)\n\n3. 1+3*13=40 (level 3)\n\n4. 1+3*40=121 (level 4)\n\n5. 1+3*121=364 (level 5)\n\n6. 1+3*364"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Then, moving one level out, the next expression is (1+3(4)). Wait, that's because the next layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1+3(13)). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply it by 3, add 1, and that's the new result. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next layer: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so after each step, I'm getting a new number. Let me check if I did each step correctly because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. So after all those layers, the innermost parentheses worked their way out to 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 80000 = 240000, 3 * 8000 = 24000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 70 = 210, 3 * 3 = 9. Wait, but 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, breaking it down:\n\n3 * 80000 = 240000\n\n3 * 8000 = 24000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 70 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3 * 88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, carry over 2\n\n3 * 0 (since 88573 is 88,573, so after 8, it's 8, then 5,7,3). Wait, maybe I should write it out:\n\n88573\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n\n3 * 0 (since there are no more digits, but wait, 88573 is 88,573, so after 8, it's 8,5,7,3. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 88573 is 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 as the next digit. So, the result is 265719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is one layer, then each additional (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n11. (1+3(...))\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time it's wrapped in another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)) until we reach the outermost. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, we have a (1+3(...)) until we reach the outermost. Let me count how many times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nEach time, it's one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, because each (1+3(...)) adds one. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nStarting from the 3, then (1+3(...)), so each time there's a new (1+3(...)), so how many times does that happen? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I worked through the problem earlier, I ended up with 10 layers, but perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, we have a (1+3). Let me count how many times we have (1+3) inside.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n10. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))))\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check: the initial expression is 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more (1+3(...)) layers, making a total of 9 layers after the initial 3. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, which may have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1+3). Let me count the number of times I see (1+3). Let me parse it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, when I computed earlier, I went up to 10 layers, but that might have been a mistake. So, perhaps I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had:\n\n1. 4\n\n2. 13\n\n3. 40\n\n4. 121\n\n5. 364\n\n6. 1093\n\n7. 3280\n\n8. 9841\n\n9. 29524\n\n10. 88573\n\nBut if there are only 9 layers after the initial 3, then perhaps the final result before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and then 3 * 29524 would be 88572, which is different from what I had earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try to recount the layers properly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), how many times does it wrap?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) inside:\n\nEach time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, but the original expression seems to have 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as follows: the innermost is (1+3). Then, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you see (1+3 in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1+3) is at the innermost. Then, each time, it's wrapped in another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times the pattern (1+3(...) appears after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first (1+3(...)), which is the innermost, and moving outward, each time, it's wrapped in another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I compute step by step, I have 10 layers because I include the innermost as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another, making a total of 9 layers after the initial 3, but perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me try to structure it differently.\n\nLet me represent the expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2 = (1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nL10 = (1 + 3*L9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1+3(...) is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time you have a (1+3(...)), and the outermost is the 9th one.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost layer, which is L1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each (1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is (1 + 3*(...)), which contains 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nWait, no, because each (1 + 3*(...)) is one layer. So, the initial (1 + 3*(...)) is the first layer, then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)) is the second layer, and so on until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but when I compute, I end up with 10 layers, including the innermost as layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute it step by step again, carefully counting the layers.\n\nLet me write out each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3*Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...) in the expression after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the first (1+3(...)) after the initial 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer.\n\nSo, the first (1+3(...)) is layer 1, which is (1+3(1+3(...))), but wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that each (1+3(...) is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...) in the expression after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to one (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the first layer is (1+3(...)), which is the innermost, then each subsequent layer wraps around it.\n\nTherefore, when I computed up to Layer 10, I might have gone one layer too far.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, so the final value before multiplying by 3 is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed, I had Layer 10 as 88573, and then 3 * 88573 = 265719.\n\nBut if the expression only has 9 layers, then the final result before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), how many times does the pattern (1+3(...) repeat? Let me count the number of (1+3(...) after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), which contains 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, that would be 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of (1+3(...) in the expression after the initial 3 is 9, so there are 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, my earlier computation went one layer too far, making Layer 10, but perhaps it should only be 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value, so 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7       3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result of 265719. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers earlier.\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers, then the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 10 layers, which led me to 265719, but that might have been incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: how many layers are in the original expression?\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...) after the initial 3.\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the initial 3, the first (1+3(...) is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, that would be 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, which gave me 88573 before multiplying by 3, leading to 265719. But that seems inconsistent with the original expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nLet me write the expression with parentheses:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's (1 + 3*(...)), and the number of times this occurs after the initial 3 is 9.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), up to 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the computation should stop at layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to layer 10, I got 88573, which seems to be one layer too many.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had computed up to layer 10, which gave me 88573 before multiplying by 3, leading to 265719, but that seems incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to confirm by looking at the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer, and there are 9 such layers after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the computation should go up to layer 9, giving 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, which included the initial 3 as a layer, but that might not be correct because the initial 3 is just a multiplier, not part of the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So, the layers are only the (1 + 3*(...)) parts, which are 9 in number.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to layer 9, giving 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to layer 10, I got 88573, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recount the layers again.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression with indices.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) starting from the innermost.\n\nEach time, the expression is (1 + 3*(...)), and each time, it's nested inside another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*(29524)) = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers because it starts with (1+3) and then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer, making a total of 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I have 10 layers, which suggests that perhaps the initial (1+3) is layer 1, and then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer,"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try to parse this.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3), and so on, until the outermost part is multiplied by 3. Let me write this down step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me start from the inside and move outward.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a good approach. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:  \nLayer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2:  \nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nWe already know Layer 1 is 4, so:  \nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3:  \nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nLayer 2 is 13, so:  \nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4:  \nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 3 is 40, so:  \nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5:  \nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nLayer 4 is 121, so:  \nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6:  \nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nLayer 5 is 364, so:  \nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7:  \nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nLayer 6 is 1093, so:  \nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8:  \nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7)  \nLayer 7 is 3280, so:  \nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9:  \nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 8 is 9841, so:  \nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is:  \nTotal = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Wait, no, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \nFirst, multiply 3 by 4: 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.  \n3\u00d72=6 +1=7  \n3\u00d75=15  \n3\u00d79=27  \n3\u00d72=6  \nSo, putting it together: 6 (from 2), 15 (from 5), 27 (from 9), 6 (from 2), and the last digit 2 from 4\u00d73=12. Wait, no, maybe I should write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the number is 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 in another way.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 =60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1+3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1+3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers seem correct. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because each time I compute a layer, the numbers are getting much larger, so 88572 seems plausible, but maybe I can check the expression another way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the nth layer, starting from L_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, which might help verify my result.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C  \nC -3C =1  \n-2C=1  \nC= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A =4 +1/2=9/2  \nA= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ by expanding it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. **Layer 2**: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. **Layer 3**: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. **Layer 4**: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. **Layer 5**: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. **Layer 6**: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. **Layer 7**: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. **Layer 8**: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. **Layer 9**: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's a recursive kind of problem or something that can be simplified by working from the inside out.\n\nLet me write it down again to visualize better: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, right? Then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. Let me try to work this out step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. Maybe if I compute each part one by one, it'll be manageable.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3(, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are 9 layers. Hmm, so I need to compute from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where each Lk is 1 + 3*L(k-1). So starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on until L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so that would be 3*L9, where L9 is the innermost expression. Wait, no, perhaps I got that reversed. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13). So 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that. Wait, 3*40 is 120, right, and then 1 + 120 is 121. Hmm, okay.\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, correct. 363 + 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, wait, 3*1093: Let me compute that more carefully. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Okay, correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280: Alternatively, 3280*3. Let me compute 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 9841 * 3. Let me do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, let me verify 29524*3: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So yes, 29524*3=88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, but 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now add them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me check 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So 88573*3=265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(265720). So that's 3*265720. Let's compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Now add them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 265720 * 3. Let's compute it as (200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20) * 3.\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\nAdding these together:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160\n\nSo 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the inner expression. So after computing all the layers, the inner expression evaluates to 265720, and then we multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, the final result is 797160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because that's a big number, and it's easy to make an error in the arithmetic.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly to check for any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 265720, but now I'm seeing that maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the layer numbering. Let's recount the layers because I think I may have miscounted how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a (, that's a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n1: 3(\n2: 3(\n3: 3(\n4: 3(\n5: 3(\n6: 3(\n7: 3(\n8: 3(\n9: 3(\n10: 3(\n11: 3(\n12: 3)\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each of those is a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So the total number of layers is 9, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then the outermost layer was 3*(29524) = 88572, and then that would be the entire expression? Wait, no, perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, until Layer 1 is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, Layer 4 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 6 as 1093, Layer 7 as 3280, Layer 8 as 9841, Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I went up to 265720. So I must have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. Let me parse the expression carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3*\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each layer adds another \"1 + 3*\"\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3*\" instances.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After first 3: 1(\n2. Then another 3( inside: 2(\n3. Then another 3( inside: 3(\n4. Then another 3( inside: 4(\n5. Then another 3( inside: 5(\n6. Then another 3( inside: 6(\n7. Then another 3( inside: 7(\n8. Then another 3( inside: 8(\n9. Then another 3( inside: 9(\n10. Then another 3( inside: 10(\nWait, that can't be right because the expression ends with ))))))))).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of 1 + 3*(...) instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first 1 + 3( is Layer 1.\n2. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 2.\n3. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 3.\n4. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 4.\n5. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 5.\n6. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 6.\n7. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 7.\n8. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 8.\n9. Then another 1 + 3( is Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3(, so that would make Layer 9 the innermost, right? So starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me try to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time you have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\nThen moving out, each layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\". So the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3(, it's 1 + 3(\n2. Then another 1 + 3(\n3. Then another 1 + 3(\n4. Then another 1 + 3(\n5. Then another 1 + 3(\n6. Then another 1 + 3(\n7. Then another 1 + 3(\n8. Then another 1 + 3(\n9. Then another 1 + 3(\n10. Then another 1 + 3( ? Wait, no, the expression ends with ))))))))).\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write the expression with indices:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each time we move out, we have another 1 + 3*(Layer k-1). So the total number of layers is 9, as the expression has 9 sets of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, computing from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier, when I went further, I got up to 265720, but that must have been a mistake because the number of layers is 9, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by computing more layers than necessary. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nExpression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds another layer.

Let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that must be the correct answer, 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond Layer 9 and got up to 265720, but that must have been a mistake because the expression only has 9 layers. So I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 9 layers, so the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is indeed 3*(...), where the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So with 9 layers, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume Lk^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor k=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had more layers, I got a different result, but now with the formula, it's clear that 9 layers give 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. \n\n1. **Innermost expression (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. $1 + 3$ is equal to $4$. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))))$ Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nActually, the entire expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last one: $1 + 3$. Then, moving outwards, each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from Level 1, which is the innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nThen, moving to Level 2: $1 + 3*(Level 1)$. Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes $1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13$.\n\nNext, Level 3: $1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40$.\n\nLevel 4: $1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121$.\n\nLevel 5: $1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364$.\n\nLevel 6: $1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$.\n\nLevel 7: $1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$.\n\nLevel 8: $1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$.\n\nLevel 9: $1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is $3*(...)$, so after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me recount each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let me find C.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + C.\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3C + 1.\n\nSetting them equal: A*3^n + C = A*3^n + 3C + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: C = 3C + 1.\n\nSo, -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n levels, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 levels. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is Level 1, and each subsequent level adds another layer. So, if we have 9 layers, then n=9.\n\nBut wait, in our initial computation, Level 1 was 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, Level 2 would be (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, indeed, Level n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Level 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express this without computing each level, but I think the step-by-step approach works fine.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the number of levels. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts inside the 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on. Each time, adding another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3(, that's 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each adding a new 1+3(...). So, Level 9 is the innermost, and when we compute up to Level 9, we get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula can be applied differently. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, that's a quicker way.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each time, the value is tripling and adding 1, so the numbers get big quickly, but the formula helps us avoid computing each step manually.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each level again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a common strategy with nested expressions. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is $1+3$. That should be straightforward. So, $1 + 3 = 4$. Then, moving one layer out, the next part is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Since the innermost part is now 4, the next layer would be $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let me compute that: $3 \\times 4 = 12$, then $1 + 12 = 13$. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{previous result})$. The previous result was 13, so this becomes $1 + 3 \\times 13$. Calculating that: $3 \\times 13 = 39$, and then $1 + 39 = 40$. So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is $1 + 3 \\times 40$. Let's compute that: $3 \\times 40 = 120$, and then $1 + 120 = 121$. That's 121.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 121$. So, $3 \\times 121 = 363$, then $1 + 363 = 364$. So, now we're at 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times 364$. Let me calculate that: $3 \\times 364 = 1092$, then $1 + 1092 = 1093$. That's 1093.\n\nNext, the expression becomes $1 + 3 \\times 1093$. Calculating that: $3 \\times 1093 = 3279$, then $1 + 3279 = 3280$. So, 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is $1 + 3 \\times 3280$. Let's see: $3 \\times 3280 = 9840$, then $1 + 9840 = 9841$. So, that's 9841.\n\nNow, moving another layer out: $1 + 3 \\times 9841$. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step. First, $3 \\times 9841 = 29,523$. Then, adding 1 gives $29,523 + 1 = 29,524$. So, that's 29,524.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 29,524$. Let me calculate $3 \\times 29,524$. Well, 29,524 times 3: 29,524 x 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 x 3 = 60,000; 9,000 x 3 = 27,000; 500 x 3 = 1,500; 24 x 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, $3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572$. Then, adding 1 gives $88,572 + 1 = 88,573$. So, that's 88,573.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer: $1 + 3 \\times 88,573$. Let me compute that. First, $3 \\times 88,573$. Let's do that step by step: 80,000 x 3 = 240,000; 8,000 x 3 = 24,000; 500 x 3 = 1,500; 70 x 3 = 210; 3 x 3 = 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, $3 \\times 88,573 = 265,719$. Then, adding 1 gives $265,719 + 1 = 265,720$. So, that's 265,720.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the last step. So, we had the expression: $1 + 3 \\times 88,573$. I calculated $3 \\times 88,573$ as 265,719, then added 1 to get 265,720. Hmm, but let me verify that multiplication again.\n\nCalculating 88,573 x 3:\n\n- 3 x 3 = 9\n- 3 x 7 = 21, carry over 2\n- 3 x 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n- 3 x 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n- 3 x 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, writing it down: 265,719. Yes, that seems correct. So, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is $3 \\times (\\text{that result})$. Wait, no, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this big expression. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, the entire expression is 3 times the big nested part. So, after computing the innermost part and working outwards, the last result I got was 265,720. But that's the value of the innermost expression, right? Wait, no, actually, each layer I computed was the value of the expression starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that means there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, I did nine steps.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1+3(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1+3(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1+3(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1+3(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1+3(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1+3(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1+3(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1+3(9841) = 29,524\n\nWait, so after nine layers, I end up with 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this 29,524. So, 3 x 29,524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 x 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20,000 x 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 x 3 = 27,000\n- 500 x 3 = 1,500\n- 24 x 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so 3 x 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier steps, I went beyond nine layers, didn't I? Because I thought the last result was 265,720, but that seems incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers. Let me clarify this.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied inside:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses: (1+3(1+3(... So, that would mean nine layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers to compute.\n\nSo, let's list them step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value. So, 3 x 29,524.\n\nCalculating that: 29,524 x 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n- 20,000 x 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 x 3 = 27,000\n- 500 x 3 = 1,500\n- 24 x 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 x 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, earlier I thought I had 265,720, but that was because I miscounted the layers. It's actually nine layers, so the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 88,572.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1,092=1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1,093=1+3,279=3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3,280=1+9,840=9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9,841=1+29,523=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recursive sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a geometric series because each term is a multiple of the previous term plus a constant. Specifically, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n*a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our case, k = 3 and c = 1. But wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k = 3 and c = 1. The initial term a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence:\n\na_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nActually, the general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = k^{n} * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be the term before a_1, which is not given. Wait, perhaps I should index the terms differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the sequence starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, to find a_9, we can use the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when c=0, so a_n = 3^n * a_0.\n\nThe particular solution when c=1 is a constant solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = 3^n * C - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = 3^n * (3/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again because I might have made a mistake in the indexing. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by using the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrived at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Each subsequent layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from previous step)}\\):\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n3. Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. So, let me try to parse this.\n\nLet me write it down step by step, starting from the inside. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So, that's 1 plus 3, which is 4. Then, moving one level out, I have another 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), so inside that, there's another 3(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and this continues until the innermost part, which is just (1+3). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see, each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers? Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time moving outward, there are 8 layers. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Let me write each layer as a separate equation, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outward, a2 = 1 + 3*a1.\n\nSimilarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on until a9, and then the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, starting from a1, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, let me compute each a_n step by step.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times a9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(a9). So, the total value would be 3*a9.\n\nSo, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in computing a9.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 = 3000.\n\n3*93 = 279.\n\nSo, 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, a7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 = 9000.\n\n3*280 = 840.\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*800 = 2400.\n\n3*40 = 120.\n\n3*1 = 3.\n\nSo, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400.\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520.\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, a9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times? Or is it eight times? Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), so that's two layers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try to write each layer as a_n, starting from the innermost.\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is a1 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 3*a1) = a2.\n\nThen, the next is (1 + 3*a2) = a3.\n\nAnd so on, until a9.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*a9, so the total expression is 3*a9, which we computed as 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the left, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and this continues until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2. Then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers? But when I computed a9, that was 9 layers, but the initial 3 is multiplied by a9, which would be the 10th layer? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as having 8 layers. Let me try that approach again.\n\nWait, let's see: The innermost is (1+3), which is a1=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, a1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a9), so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nWait, because each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_n, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3*(...\n3. And so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers, so a9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and each computation seems accurate. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost part and using a recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Innermost Layer:**\n   The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a1 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - a1 = 4\n   - a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   The entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute it from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outward. That seems like a logical approach because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIt's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). Since there are multiple layers, I'll need to compute each innermost part first. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that with another 3 times (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times (1 + 3), but wait, actually, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + the next layer). So, maybe I should approach it by starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4, then the next is 1 + 3*(result from previous), and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since I think there are nine layers. Let me confirm: starting from the innermost, each time we have another 3*(1 + ...), so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see that each 3(1 + ... ) is nested inside another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, maybe I can count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just start computing from the innermost and go outward step by step, regardless of how many layers there are. Let's try that.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Wait, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing the innermost layers, the outermost would be 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers I computed:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so I actually have 10 layers here, but the original problem seems to have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), and each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each layer adds another 3*(1+...)\n- So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1+...). Let me count the number of 3(1+... in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments. Each time, starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time, adding another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1+...):\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier, excluding the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is at position 1: (1+3(...))\n- Then inside that, another ( at position 3: (1+3(...))\n- And so on until the last (...)))\n\nHow many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each (1+3( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3( segments:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n10. 3(1+3)\n\nWait, but the last one is (1+3)), so maybe there are 9 layers of 3*(1+...). Hmm, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 10 layers, which resulted in 88572. But perhaps I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is layer 1, then each subsequent 3*(1+...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 3*(1+...) occurs.\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, we have a 3*(1+3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1+...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so each layer adds one more 3*(1+...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the original expression seems to have 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the computation steps are 10 because we start with (1+3) and then each layer adds another step. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each \"3*(1 + ...)\" as a layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer is a 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1, then the next layer is 3*(1 + layer1), which is layer2, and so on, up to layer9. Then, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, in total, the computation would involve 9 layers inside, and then the outermost multiplication by 3, making it 10 steps. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the first 3, the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...) is 9 times. Therefore, the computation would involve 9 layers, each time computing 3*(1 + result from the previous layer).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 10 layers because I started with (1+3) as the first step, then each subsequent layer. So, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the initial (1+3) is considered a layer or not.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive structure. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but earlier I computed f(2) as 13, which contradicts this. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, no, let's see. If f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), then f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, that's not right because in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), and f(0) = 1? Wait, that might not be correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the base case. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have the innermost expression as (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16=48, and so on. Wait, but earlier I had a different result. So perhaps my initial computation was wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to approach it methodically.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as L1, L2, L3, up to L9.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12; then L2 = 1 + L2_inner? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, total layers inside: 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3, making it 10 steps.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the computation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, f(2)=15, f(3)=48, etc., I got different numbers, which suggests I was using a different approach. So, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), whereas in my function f(n), I was defining f(n) as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), which would be similar to the layers here.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I started with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13, and so on, which seems to align with the original problem's structure.\n\nSo, if I compute each layer as L_i = 1 + 3*L_{i-1}, starting with L1 = 4, then:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result should be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example to ensure my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*(40) = 120\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, then outermost 3*40=120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, f(3)=3*(1 +15)=48, but that doesn't match. Wait, so perhaps my function definition is wrong.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, the correct result is 120, but using f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting with f(1)=4, gives f(2)=15, f(3)=48, which is different. Therefore, my function approach was incorrect, which suggests that my initial step-by-step computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(13) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(121) = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(364) = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1093) = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(3280) = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(9841) = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. After computing all nine layers inside, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, I see that this 4 is multiplied by 3, right? So, the next part is 3 times that 4. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, I add 1 to that, so 12 plus 1 is 13. Hmm, so that innermost part simplifies to 13. Let me write that down.\n\nWait, maybe I should write each step as I go along to keep track. So, let's start from the inside and move outward.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Then, 1 + result from step 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, that's the first layer done. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let me compute that.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check. So, the previous result was 13, so 3 times 13 is 39, then 1 plus 39 is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\n5. Next layer: 3*40 = 120\n6. Then, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, so now we have 121. Let me see if I'm following the pattern correctly. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, and then add 1. So, it's like each layer is building on the previous one. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nIf I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a layer. So, from (1+3) up to the ninth layer, which would be the outermost one. So, maybe I need to compute up to a_9.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3 except the innermost one. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 3*(Layer1) +1\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1 as (1 + 3), then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), etc. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, how many 1 + 3(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the 3s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, if the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)) inside each other. Let me check.\n\nYes, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3(...)), and each is multiplied by 3 except the innermost one. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I went up to a_9 as 29524, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, then the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, 3*29524 would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, no, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(a_9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, a_9 is the result after 9 layers, so 3*(a_9) would be 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers. Let me write out each step carefully.\n\nLet me try to write down each step with the correct a_n values.\n\na_1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\na_2: 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3: 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4: 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5: 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6: 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7: 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8: 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9: 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 30000*3 = 90000, then subtract 476*3 because 29524 = 30000 - 476.\n\nWait, 30000 - 476 = 29524. So, 3*29524 = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original problem has how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, the number of layers is 9 because each time you have a new \"1+3(\" before the next set of parentheses. So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers. So, a_1 to a_9, as I computed, and then the outermost 3*(a_9) is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. The sequence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach.\n\nLet me test the formula with a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify once more by computing each layer step by step, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting with a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 =1 + 39=40.\n\na_4=1 + 3*a_3=1 + 120=121.\n\na_5=1 + 3*a_4=1 + 363=364.\n\na_6=1 + 3*a_5=1 + 1092=1093.\n\na_7=1 + 3*a_6=1 + 3279=3280.\n\na_8=1 + 3*a_7=1 + 9840=9841.\n\na_9=1 + 3*a_8=1 + 29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous result. By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost result is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 3*121 first.\n\n3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 + 3*121 is 1 + 363, which is 364. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that.\n\n3*364: Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nWait, is that right? 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, let me double-check: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841.\n\nHmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 + 120=29520, 29520 + 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524.

Then, 1 + 88572=88573. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9.

Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step computed correctly. So, the final result should be 265,719.\n\nWait a second, let me just go through each step once more to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake with all these multiplications.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 265,719.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it step by step made it manageable. I don't think I made any mistakes this time, but if I did, it might be in one of the multiplications. Maybe I should double-check a couple of the larger multiplications.\n\nLet me check step 10: 3*29524. So, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, step 11: 3*88573.\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3=9.\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15, plus 2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24, plus 1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n8*3=24, plus 2=26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nThere's no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265,719. Correct.\n\nOkay, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. By systematically computing each layer, the final result is found to be 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

Calculating that, 3*1093 is... let me do 1000*3 = 3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(9841). Hmm, 3*9841. Let me break that down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding all together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. It seems like each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each step is 3 times the previous plus 1. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a huge number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Correct.\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719. Correct.\n\nHmm, each step seems right. So, I think the final answer is 265,719. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the multiplications.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote each term as a_n, where n is the level, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many layers do we have here? Let's count the number of times the expression is nested.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)): Let's see, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time moving out, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n10. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer out adds another. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, the number of 1+3 increases by one. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another, so the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another until we have 9 layers. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer out is another 1+3(...), so total layers from the innermost to the outermost is 9. Therefore, n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers because I started counting from 1+3 as the first layer, then each subsequent layer added one more. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, in the original expression, the number of 1+3 terms is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another until we have 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nSo, the outermost layer is the 9th layer, meaning n=9. Therefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n=9, we get a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step computation, I ended up with a_10 = 88573, which would correspond to n=10. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a_n where n is the number of layers starting from the innermost as n=1. So, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time nested within another. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Because the outermost expression is 3 times (1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more layers. Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning n=9. Let me think. The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so the next layer is 1+3*(layer1), which is layer2, and so on until layer9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). Therefore, in the formula, a_n would be layer n, so a_9 is the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but in my step-by-step earlier, I had a_9 as 29524, which matches. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, but wait, in my step-by-step, I had the outermost as 3*(88573), which gave 265719. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula gives a_n as the value inside the nth layer, so the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, if a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But in my step-by-step, I had a_10 as 88573, which would be incorrect because the formula says a_9 is 29524, and then the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572, which is different from what I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because my step-by-step gave me 265,719, but according to the formula, it should be 88,572. That means I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step and see where I went wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4 (layer1)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (layer2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (layer3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (layer4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (layer5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (layer6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (layer7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (layer8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (layer9)\n10. 1+3*29524=88573 (layer10)\n11. 3*88573=265,719.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=29524, and the outermost is 3*29524=88,572, but in my step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which would be a_10=88,573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, perhaps the formula is for a_n being the value at the nth layer, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), not 3*(a_10). So, in the problem, the number of layers is 9, meaning n=9, so a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which suggests that maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first (1+3 is the innermost.\n2. Then another (1+3 inside that.\n3. Continuing, each time there's a new (1+3.\n\nCounting the number of times (1+3 appears: Let's see, after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning n=9, so a_9=29524, and then the outermost is 3*a_9=88,572. But in my step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which would imply n=10, giving a_10=88,573, and then 3*a_10=265,719.\n\nSo, which is correct? Let me check the formula again. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1=4, which matches 3^2=9, (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9=29524, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which would be a_10= (3^{11} -1)/2= (177147-1)/2=177146/2=88573, and then 3*a_10=265,719.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because I miscounted the number of layers. The problem has 9 layers of 1+3(...), so n=9, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which suggests that I counted 10 layers, but the problem only has 9. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3 expressions inside the outermost 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3 is layer1.\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3 is layer2.\n- Continuing, each time adding a new layer.\n\nHow many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach ( after the first 3( starts a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside that: 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. Then another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. Another ( inside: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, so after the initial 3(, there are 9 more (1+3(...) expressions, meaning n=9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went up to layer10, which would be incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers. So, I must have miscounted the layers in my initial step-by-step. Let me recount.\n\nLet me start over with the correct number of layers, n=9.\n\n1. Layer1: 1+3=4\n2. Layer2: 1+3*4=13\n3. Layer3: 1+3*13=40\n4. Layer4: 1+3*40=121\n5. Layer5: 1+3*121=364\n6. Layer6: 1+3*364=1093\n7. Layer7: 1+3*1093=3280\n8. Layer8: 1+3*3280=9841\n9. Layer9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had an extra layer, layer10, which was 1+3*29524=88573, and then 3*88573=265,719. But that's incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers, so the outermost is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me write it out:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which is incorrect. So, I must have miscounted. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which gave me 265,719. So, which is correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is giving me a_9=29524, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88,572. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut then why did my initial step-by-step go up to layer10? Because I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the problem.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The first (1+3 is layer1.\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3 is layer2.\n3. Continuing, each time adding a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, after the first 3(, there's a (1+3 followed by another (.\n\nSo, let's count the number of ( after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2.

Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which would be incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because the formula gives me a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, leading to 265,719. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me re-examine the formula.\n\nThe formula was derived for a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers starting from the innermost as n=1.\n\nIn the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), so the total value is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer10, which would be a_10=(3^{11}-1)/2=177146/2=88573, and then 3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because I miscounted the number of layers. The problem has 9 layers, so n=9, leading to the answer 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which gave me 265,719. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the problem.\n\nLet me write the problem out with each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)=1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)=1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)=1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572, not 265,719. I must have miscounted the layers in my initial step-by-step, thinking there were 10 layers instead of 9.\n\nSo, to summarize, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 with n=9, we get a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use a formula to find the value without computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe expression can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a general formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nCalculating a_"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me write it down more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost part.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, I have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check that again. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, each time, I'm replacing the innermost expression with its value and moving outward. So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing all the inner layers, the result is 29524, and then we multiply by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- There's no digit beyond that, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Let me compute it another way:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let me list each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step, I multiply the previous result by 3 and add 1, then the outermost layer is multiplying by 3 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a nested multiplication. Each time, you have 1 + 3*something, and that something is the same structure.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 is the innermost 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also get 88572, which matches my step-by-step computation. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me recompute each step without using the formula, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Final result = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step seems accurate. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a geometric progression. The closed-form formula I derived earlier confirms that, so that gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer simplifies step by step until the final result is obtained. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it'll be easier. So, let's try that approach.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one step out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so now that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Calculating that, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that layer becomes 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's a bigger number, but okay.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's getting large quickly.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). So, 3*1093 is... let me see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, hold on, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. That number seems familiar. Isn't that a square of something? Let me check: 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000. So, 99 squared is 9801, 9841 minus 9801 is 40, so it's not a perfect square. Maybe it's a cube or something else? Not sure, but maybe it's just a number in the sequence.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nSo, that layer becomes 29524. Hmm, 29524. That also seems like a large number, but I think I'm on the right track.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check the multiplication again. 3*29524: 29524 times 3. Let's do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, it's 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication again because 88573 is a big number. Let me compute 88573*3:\n\n88573\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right: 3*3=9\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2\nThere's no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nSo, that gives 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 265720*3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 797160.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because each step depends on the previous one, and one mistake early on could throw off the entire result.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Finally: 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, so that's 12 layers in total? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to confirm. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(...)\". Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(...)\"\n- Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...): There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I ended up with 12 layers. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n11. (1 + 3(...))\n12. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result 2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result 3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result 4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result 5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result 6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result 7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result 8)\n10. 1 + 3*(result 9)\n11. 1 + 3*(result 10)\n12. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result 11)\n\nWait, so that's 12 layers in total? Because starting from 1 + 3 as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so up to layer 11, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I ended up with 12 layers, so that seems consistent. So, the final result is 797,160.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recompute the outermost layers again to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797,160\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers get larger as we move outward, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the result of this expression is 797,160. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step seems logical. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is then used in the next layer. After simplifying each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last computed value by 3. \n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\)\n11. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 265720\\)\n12. Final multiplication: \\(3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{797160}"

    "text": " Maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's try to parse this from the inside out. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to write down each step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, that's not right. Because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I need to compute the innermost parentheses first, then multiply by 3, then add 1. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me write down the entire expression more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try that.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). But wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next inner layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Let me number the layers from inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. Each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but that would make Layer 2 equal to 15, but then Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which suggests that each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3*(...), each time there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many 3*(...) there are.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3*(...)\n2. Inside that, another 3*(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(...):\n\n- The first 3*(...) is the outermost one.\n\nThen inside that, another 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression seems to have 9 layers of 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)):\n\n- The first 3(1+3(...)) is the outermost one.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1+3( occur? Let's see:\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...) terms.\n\nEach time we see a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 1\n2. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 2\n3. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 3\n4. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 4\n5. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 5\n6. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 6\n7. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 7\n8. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 8\n9. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - Layer 9\n10. Finally, the innermost is (1 + 3) - Layer 10? Wait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 10? Or is it Layer 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, as I did before:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after computing each layer, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which equals 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, with 9 layers of 3*(...), the final result is Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWe can expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConverting 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nTherefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3^n:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} ) - 3/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^n is 3*3^{n-1}, so 11/6 *3^n = 11/6 *3*3^{n-1} = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nNow, let's check this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/2)*3^{0} - 3/2 = (11/2)*1 - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11/2)*3^{1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3 - 3/2 = 33/2 - 3/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11/2)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/2)*9 - 3/2 = 99/2 - 3/2 = 96/2 =48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/2)*3^{8} - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\nSo, 3^8=6561\n\nNow, compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/2)*6561:\n\nFirst, 6561 * 11 = ?\n\n6561 * 10 = 65610\n\n6561 *1 = 6561\n\nTotal: 65610 + 6561 = 72171\n\nSo, 72171 / 2 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084\n\nWhich matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^8 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 11/2 * 6561 = (11 * 6561)/2\n\n11 * 6561: Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 10*6561=65610\n\nAdd 6561: 65610 + 6561=72171\n\nThen, 72171 / 2 = 36085.5\n\nSubtract 3/2=1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5=36084\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 3*(1 + previous term), it's more of a linear recurrence.\n\nBut in any case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution give the same result, so I'm confident that 36084 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me write it out to visualize it better.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nAlright, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.

So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, we're calculating 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*1 + 3*3*(...) = 3 + 9*(...). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3):\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost, each step is 3*(result). Wait, no, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me write the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1: (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving out, layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) =13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13)=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40)=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121)=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364)=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093)=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280)=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841)=29524.\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(29524)=88573.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost 9 layers, the outermost is 3*(result). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 10 as 88573, but that might be incorrect because the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, not adding 1 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Let me see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a repeated process. Let me try to see how many times we apply the 1 + 3*(...) operation.\n\nLet me consider that each time, we're nesting another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3)=4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4)=13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13)=40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40)=121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121)=364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364)=1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093)=3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280)=9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(9841)=29524.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(29524)=88573.\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), right? Because starting from (1+3), that's layer 1, then each subsequent 1 + 3*(...) is another layer. So, layer 1: 4, layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524, layer10:88573.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(layer10). So, after computing layer10 as 88573, we multiply by 3. Wait, no, no. Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, after computing the innermost layer, each step is 1 + 3*(result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3)=4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(4)=13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13)=40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(40)=121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(121)=364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(364)=1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(1093)=3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(3280)=9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(9841)=29524.\n\nLayer10: 1 + 3*(29524)=88573.\n\nWait, but the outermost operation is 3*(Layer10). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10). So, 3*(88573)=265,719.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again because I think I might be miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nFrom the innermost, (1+3), that's 1 layer. Then each time we go out, another layer. So, let's count how many times (1+3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. So, the total number of layers is 9, each time adding another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer10 as 88573, that would be the result of 9 layers, right? Because starting from layer1 as (1+3)=4, then layer2 as 1+3*4=13, up to layer9 as 29524, and then layer10 as 88573. But then the outermost operation is 3*(layer10). So, 3*88573=265,719.\n\nBut let me verify that because I might be miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each (1+3(...)) as a term, so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct because 88573 seems high. Let me recompute each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Each step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let's compute that: 88573 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 88573 * 3:\n\n3*80,000 = 240,000\n\n3*8,000 = 24,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nSo, 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(result of 9 layers). So, the final answer should be 265,719.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. So, 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we get 88,573, and then multiply by 3 to get 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved as follows.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, after 9 layers, I got 29,524. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573. So, that would be n=10: a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88,573.\n\nYes, that matches. So, a_10 = 88,573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(a_10), and a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2, then 3*a_10 = 3*(3^{11} -1)/2 = (3^{12} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{12}: 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147, 3^12=531,441.\n\nSo, 3*a_10 = (531,441 - 3)/2 = 531,438/2 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, after 9 layers, we have a_9 = 29,524, then a_10 = 88,573, and then 3*a_10 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus 1. But in this case, since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n- After 9 layers, we get 29,524.\n\n- Then, one more layer: 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573.\n\n- Finally, multiply by 3: 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*( (3^{11} -1)/2 ) = (3^{12} -3)/2 = (531,441 -3)/2 = 531,438/2 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the expression simplifies to 265,719.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Start with the innermost expression**: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Work outwards layer by layer**, each time computing 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n   - Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**: 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{265719}$"

Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, so the second innermost part is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Now, moving out another layer.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to see if this pattern continues. Let me list each step as I go outwards.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, maybe? Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are 9 layers in total. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) - layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer1)) - layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer2)) - layer 3\n...\nUp to layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses.\n\nSo, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 at the very end.\n\nLet me write down each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the problem is 3*(... all the layers ...). So, after computing Layer9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit long. Maybe I should compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73\n\n29000 \u00d7 3 = 87000\n\n524 \u00d7 3: 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572\n\nNow, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so the final answer should be 88572. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me verify each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. For example, if I have just 1 layer, it's 3\u00d7(1+3) = 3\u00d74 = 12. If I have 2 layers, it's 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d7(1 + 3)) = 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d74) = 3\u00d713 = 39. Wait, but according to my earlier computation, with 2 layers, it's 13, then multiplied by 3 gives 39. But in my initial breakdown, I started counting from the innermost as layer1, so with 2 layers, it's layer1 and layer2, and the total expression is 3\u00d7layer2, which is 3\u00d713=39. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my problem, the expression has 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, when I computed up to layer9, that's the value inside the 3(...), so multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me try a particular solution as a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59049, then (59049 -1)=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outward. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, now that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that part becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me confirm that. So, if I denote each step as a term in a sequence, maybe I can model this as a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is calculated as 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is term 1: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then term 2: a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Term 3: a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Term 4: a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Term 5: a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Term 6: a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Term 7: a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Term 8: a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Term 9: a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Term 10: a\u2081\u2080 = 1 + 3*a\u2089 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Wait, but in the original problem, how many terms are there? Let me check. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each time, the parentheses are nested, and I think there are nine levels of nesting because I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, that's nine times. So, starting from the innermost, which is a\u2081 = 4, up to a\u2089. So, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, right?\n\nWait, let me confirm: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is a\u2081 = 4, then a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, up to a\u2089 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute that step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nAdding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous calculation where a\u2081\u2080 was 88573. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, when I was computing the terms, I went up to a\u2081\u2080, but perhaps the original problem only has nine levels, so the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, not 3*a\u2081\u2080. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 a\u2081 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 a\u2082 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 a\u2083 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 a\u2084 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 a\u2085 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 a\u2086 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 a\u2087 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 a\u2088 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524. As I calculated earlier, 29524*3 is 88572. So, that should be the final answer. Wait, but earlier when I thought a\u2081\u2080 was 88573, that might have been a miscalculation because the problem only has nine levels, so a\u2089 is the last term, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nLet me confirm that computation again. 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let me think. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. When n=1, a\u2081 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a\u2089, let's compute a\u2089 using this formula.\n\na\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought a\u2081\u2080 was 88573, that was incorrect because the problem only goes up to a\u2089. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check the number of levels. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1+3(\" is a level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), so each \"1+3(\" adds another level. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 The innermost is (1+3), which is level 1.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another level. So, from the innermost, we have 9 levels, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another level. So, the outermost is level 9, which would be a\u2089. Therefore, the expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I've got it now. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is calculated as \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the previous term, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Innermost term: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\) (this is \\( a_1 \\)).\n2. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\) (this is \\( a_2 \\)).\n3. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\) (this is \\( a_3 \\)).\n4. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\) (this is \\( a_4 \\)).\n5. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\) (this is \\( a_5 \\)).\n6. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\) (this is \\( a_6 \\)).\n7. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\) (this is \\( a_7 \\)).\n8. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\) (this is \\( a_8 \\)).\n9. Next term: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\) (this is \\( a_9 \\)).\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\). We compute this as follows:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me try to parse it.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost expression is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. $1 + 3 = 4$. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(4)$. Hmm, that would be $1 + 3*4$, right? So, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. I think I'm seeing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check if this pattern continues.\n\nNext layer out: $1 + 3(40)$. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. Okay, that's a larger number, but still, the pattern holds. So, each step, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be $1 + 3(121)$. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, now we're at 364. Next layer: $1 + 3(364)$. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nMoving another layer out: $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Hmm, that's a big number. Next layer: $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer is $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me figure that out. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, moving out another layer: $1 + 3(29524)$. Let's compute 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nNow, the next layer is $1 + 3(88573)$. Let me calculate that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3(265720)$. So, 3 times 265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere because the numbers are getting really big, and I want to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to be correct. Therefore, the final result is 797,160. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss a layer or miscalculate any multiplication or addition.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), there are nine layers of 1+3(...). So, let me count the layers I computed:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (innermost)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, that's 12 steps, but I think the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me check the original problem again: it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3(...). So, when I computed 1+3(...), I did it 9 times, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I did 11 layers of 1+3(...) and then the final multiplication. That might be where I went wrong. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, when I computed 1+3(...) 9 times, and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps in my earlier calculation, I went one step too far.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's see: the original expression is 3(1+3(...)), where the inner part has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I compute from the inside, I should have 9 layers of 1+3(...) before multiplying by the outer 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 11 layers, which might be incorrect. Let me try to recount.\n\nLet me write down the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that would mean the total is 88,572, not 797,160 as I previously thought. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3), each nested inside the next. So, the first layer is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, in my initial calculation, I went beyond 9 layers and ended up with 11 layers, which was incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, let's do it step by step, 9 layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I think I messed up the number of layers earlier, which led to an incorrect final answer. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, 1+3*(Layer1) = 1+12=13 (Layer2)\n\n1+3*(Layer2)=1+39=40 (Layer3)\n\n1+3*40=121 (Layer4)\n\n1+3*121=364 (Layer5)\n\n1+3*364=1093 (Layer6)\n\n1+3*1093=3280 (Layer7)\n\n1+3*3280=9841 (Layer8)\n\n1+3*9841=29524 (Layer9)\n\nThen, 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but when I first computed, I went up to Layer11, which was wrong. So, I need to make sure I only compute up to Layer9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify the multiplication for Layer9: 3*29,524.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3=88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost layer outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, repeated 9 times, and then multiplying the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is $1+3$. So, that's simple enough: 1 plus 3 is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Since the innermost part was 4, the next one would be $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that step gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is the result from the previous step, which was 13. So that would be $1 + 3 \\times 13$. Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So now I have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is $1 + 3 \\times 40$. Let me compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121 is the next number.\n\nGoing out another layer, it's again $1 + 3 \\times 121$. Let's calculate that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 364$. Let's see, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, that's a big number, but okay.\n\nMoving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times 1093$. Calculating that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3 \\times 3280$. Let me compute that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: $1 + 3 \\times 9841$. Let's see, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me check my steps again because the numbers are getting really large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression has multiple sets of parentheses. Let me count them: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many layers? Let me check the original problem again: it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 parts.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, actually, no, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3(...) parts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of innermost 1+3 expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the number of 1+3 in the expression:\n\nLooking at the LaTeX code, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there are 8 more 1+3(...) expressions? Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see: the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)). Inside that, there's another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, the innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's see how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding layer number.\n\nLayer 1: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought there were 8 layers, but now I'm getting 9 layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions inside the first 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more opening parentheses, each adding another layer. So, that would mean 8 layers inside the first 3. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I ended up with 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's see: The innermost expression is (1+3). Then, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you have a 1+3, then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's 1+3(...). Inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. Let me count how many 1+3 expressions there are:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of 1+3 expressions is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts:\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3 is (1+3(...)) which has 8 more layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as having 9 layers of 1+3(...), but I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive expression where each layer is defined as a function of the previous layer. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Then, the innermost layer is f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, if I can figure out how many layers there are, I can compute f(n) and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nLooking back at the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions inside the first 3(...). Each time, after the first 3, there's another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- After the first 3, the first opening parenthesis is after the first 1+3, so that's one layer.\n- Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis after the next 1+3, that's two layers.\n- Continuing this way, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, n = 9.\n\nSo, if f(1) = 4, f(2) = 13, f(3)=40, f(4)=121, f(5)=364, f(6)=1093, f(7)=3280, f(8)=9841, f(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought I might have made a mistake because the numbers were getting too big. But if I count the layers correctly as 9, then it's 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for f(n). Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, f(n) = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nBut f(n) is also A*3^n + B. So:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1)=4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers. If n=9, then f(9)=29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572. But let me make sure that the original problem indeed has 9 layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3 expressions inside the first 3(...):\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, n=9, which gives f(9)=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step without using the formula to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   $$\n\n2. Use this result in the next layer:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   $$\n\n3. Continue outward:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   $$\n\n4. Next layer:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   $$\n\n5. Next:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   $$\n\n6. Continue:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   $$\n\n7. Next layer:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   $$\n\n8. Next:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   $$\n\n9. Finally:\n   $$\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   $$\n\nNow, multiply the result by 3:\n$$\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n$$\n\nThe final answer is:\n$$\n\\boxed{88572}\n$$"

Wait, let me check that. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Hmm, actually, the expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, and each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3( ... )) where ... is the first layer\n3. Then another layer outside that, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and each time, the ... is another similar expression. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, because each time we add a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, total layers inside the 3*(...): 9 layers.\n\nWait, but let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), that's Layer 2.\n\nThen, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), that's Layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost of the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, perhaps the total expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, maybe I can compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nWait, let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly, because that seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps looking for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression without computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, 0 = 2B + 1 => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nThen, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))).\n\nWait, but maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum. Let me try.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the innermost expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, but in any case, since I've already computed it step by step and verified with the closed-form formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using the formula.\n\nSince L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me try.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*something. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote E as the entire expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but perhaps each layer adds another term. Alternatively, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, maybe the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach since I've already got the answer, and it's consistent both by direct computation and by using the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again:\n\nLayer 9 = 29524\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the next one.\n\nLet me try to write down each step carefully. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). So, let's compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: $1 + 3 = 4$. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm looking at this correctly. The innermost part is indeed (1+3), right? So that's 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down.\n\n2. The next level out is: $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let's compute that. First, 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is indeed 13. Okay, so that's correct.\n\n3. Moving one level out from there, we have another expression: $1 + 3 \\times 13$. Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nWait a second, is that right? 3 times 13 is 39, yes, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that seems correct.\n\n4. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 40$. Let's compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nHmm, 3 times 40 is 120, yes, so 1 + 120 is 121. That seems correct.\n\n5. Next, moving out another level: $1 + 3 \\times 121$. Let's compute that. 3 times 121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363 because 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. That seems correct.\n\n6. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 364$. Let me compute that. 3 times 364 is... Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3 times 364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but let's check again: 3 times 364. 364 times 3: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 1093$. Let's compute that. 3 times 1093: Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3 times 1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, 3 times 1093: Let me do it another way to check. 1093 times 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, yes, 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That seems correct.\n\n8. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 3280$. Let me compute that. 3 times 3280: Hmm, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3 times 3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 3280 times 3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is indeed 9841.\n\n9. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 9841$. Let's compute that. 3 times 9841: Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3 times 9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 9841 times 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\n10. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 29524$. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: Hmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 29524 times 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 1 + 88572 is 88573. That seems correct.\n\n11. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 88573$. Let me compute that. 3 times 88573: Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3 times 88573 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 88573 times 3. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 1 + 265719 is 265720. That seems correct.\n\n12. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 265720$. Let me compute that. 3 times 265720: Hmm, 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 times 265720 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 265720 times 3. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 1 + 797160 is 797161. That seems correct.\n\n13. Now, moving out to the next level: $1 + 3 \\times 797161$. Let me compute that. 3 times 797161: Hmm, 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3 times 797161 is 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 is 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that again: 797161 times 3. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 1 + 2391483 is 2391484. That seems correct.\n\n14. Next level out: $1 + 3 \\times 2391484$. Let me compute that. 3 times 2391484: Hmm, 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. So, 3 times 2391484 is 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 is 7174453.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 2391484 times 3. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. So, 1 + 7174452 is 7174453. That seems correct.\n\n15. Finally, the outermost expression: $3 \\times 7174453$. Let me compute that. 3 times 7174453: Hmm, 7000000*3=21000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 700000*3=2100000, 40000*3=120000, 4000*3=12000, 500*3=1500, 30*3=90, 3*3=9. Wait, but 7174453 is 7,174,453. So, breaking it down:\n\n- 7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n- 174,000 * 3 = 522,000\n- 453 * 3 = 1,359\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down more accurately. Let's see:\n\n7,174,453 times 3:\n\n- 7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n- 100,000 * 3 = 300,000\n- 70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n- 4,000 * 3 = 12,000\n- 400 * 3 = 1,200\n- 50 * 3 = 150\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nWait, but 7,174,453 is 7,000,000 + 174,453. So, 174,453 can be broken down as 100,000 + 70,000 + 4,000 + 400 + 50 + 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each part:\n\n- 7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n- 100,000 * 3 = 300,000\n- 70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n- 4,000 * 3 = 12,000\n- 400 * 3 = 1,200\n- 50 * 3 = 150\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000\n\n21,300,000 + 210,000 = 21,510,000\n\n21,510,000 + 12,000 = 21,522,000\n\n21,522,000 + 1,200 = 21,523,200\n\n21,523,200 + 150 = 21,523,350\n\n21,523,350 + 9 = 21,523,359\n\nSo, 3 times 7,174,453 is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, let me check that again by another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 7,174,453 * 3 as follows:\n\n7,174,453\n\u00d7          3\n------------\n21,523,359\n\nYes, that seems correct because:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 5 = 15, carryover 1\n\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, carryover 1\n\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, carryover 1\n\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, carryover 2\n\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n3 * 7 = 21\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should do it digit by digit:\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n7,174,453\n\u00d7          3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carryover 1\n\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carryover 1\n\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carryover 2\n\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n3 * 7 = 21\n\nWait, that gives me 21,523,359 as before. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a step. Let me recount the number of steps I took. I think I went through each level correctly, starting from the innermost and working my way out, each time computing the expression step by step. Each time, I computed 1 + 3 times the previous result, and then finally multiplied the outermost result by 3.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of levels. The original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level. So, starting from the innermost, I worked out 9 levels, right? Wait, let me check:\n\nEach time I computed a level, I was moving one step out. So, starting with (1+3), that's level 1. Then, moving out, that's level 2, and so on, up to level 9, and then the outermost 3 times that result. So, perhaps I have 9 inner levels and then the outermost multiplication. Let me see.\n\nWait, when I started, I computed the innermost (1+3) as 4, then the next level as 1 + 3*4=13, and so on, until I got to the 9th level, which gave me 7,174,453. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but I just thought, perhaps I missed a level. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 levels because each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)) until we reach the outermost 3(...). Wait, maybe I should visualize this as a tree with 9 levels of nesting.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of (1+3) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of times 1 + 3 appears as a separate expression:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 innermost\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th level, perhaps?\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is an opening parenthesis, and each ) is a closing one.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level of nesting. So, each level adds another (1 + 3(...)) expression. So, the innermost is level 1, then level 2, up to level 9, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, in my earlier calculation, I started with level 1 as (1+3)=4, then level 2 as 1 + 3*4=13, level 3 as 1 + 3*13=40, level 4 as 1 + 3*40=121, level 5 as 1 + 3*121=364, level 6 as 1 + 3*364=1093, level 7 as 1 + 3*1093=3280, level 8 as 1 + 3*3280=9841, level 9 as 1 + 3*9841=29524, then the outermost as 3*29524=88572. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier steps.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute, in my initial calculation, I went through 15 steps, but perhaps that's incorrect because I miscounted the levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of (1 + 3) expressions.\n\nEach time we have a (1 + 3(...)) until we reach the outermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first one, then each subsequent one adds another level.\n\nSo, the number of times (1 + 3) is used is 9 times, each nested within the previous one.\n\nSo, that would mean that we have 9 levels of (1 + 3(...)), each time using the result from the inner level.\n\nSo, starting with level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I went up to 21,523,359. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the number of levels.\n\nWait, so according to this, the correct answer should be 88572, not 21 million. That seems more plausible because each level is only 9, not 15.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscounted the number of levels earlier, leading me to an incorrect answer.\n\nLet me try again, this time being careful about the number of levels.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 levels, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's a lot different from my initial calculation of 21 million. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh, I see now. I think I miscounted the number of levels. I thought there were more levels, but actually, it's only 9 levels of (1 + 3(...)), so the outermost 3 is only multiplied by the result after 9 levels, not 15. So, that explains the discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again, perhaps by computing each level step by step to make sure.\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the levels correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 levels, as each (1 + 3) is nested inside the previous one. So, that's 9 levels, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, yes, 9 levels, leading to the result 29524, then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nI think my initial mistake was that I continued beyond 9 levels, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using a different approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n levels, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9 levels, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, "

Let me try to write it down in parts to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the expression is 1+3. Then, that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on, seven times. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears. Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a 1+3(...).

Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1+3(...).

So, L1 to L8 as I computed before. So, 8 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L8 is 9841, and then 3*9841 is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to make sure. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but given that n is only 8, it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at the a_n sequence:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 13\n\na3 = 40\n\na4 = 121\n\na5 = 364\n\na6 = 1093\n\na7 = 3280\n\na8 = 9841\n\nHmm, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nWait, let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a1 - d/(1-c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1-c).\n\nIn this case, c = 3, d = 1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = (a1 - 1/(1-3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1-3).\n\nCompute 1/(1-3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses: 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na4 = (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na5 = (9/2)*81 -1/2 = 729/2 -1/2 =728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na6=(9/2)*243 -1/2=2187/2 -1/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na7=(9/2)*729 -1/2=6561/2 -1/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na8=(9/2)*2187 -1/2=19683/2 -1/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a8=9841.\n\nThen, the total is 3*a8=3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer in a different way, but I think the step-by-step approach is solid. Let me just recap:\n\n- Start from the innermost layer, compute each step outward.\n- Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- After computing the 8th layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost layer and working our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer (Layer 1):\n   \\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Layer 2:\n   \\[ a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Layer 3:\n   \\[ a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Layer 4:\n   \\[ a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Layer 5:\n   \\[ a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Layer 6:\n   \\[ a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Layer 7:\n   \\[ a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Layer 8:\n   \\[ a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 8 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_8 = 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is $1+3$. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. So, $1 + 3 = 4$. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is $1 + 3(1+3)$. Wait, but we just found that $1 + 3$ is 4, so substituting that in, we get $1 + 3*4$. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))$. Wait, but we already computed the inner $1 + 3(1 + 3)$ as 13. So, substituting that in, we get $1 + 3*13$. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))$. Wait, but we just found that $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))$ is 40, so substituting that in, we have $1 + 3*40$. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that level is 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, the expression becomes $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))$. Wait, but we just found that $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))$ is 121, so substituting, we get $1 + 3*121$. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that level is 364.\n\nGoing out another layer, the expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))$. Wait, but the inner part we just calculated as 364, so substituting in, we have $1 + 3*364$. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that level simplifies to 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, the expression becomes $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))$. Wait, but the inner part we just found is 1093, so substituting, we get $1 + 3*1093$. Let me compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that level is 3280.\n\nContinuing to the next outer layer, the expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))$. Wait, but the inner part is 3280, so substituting in, we have $1 + 3*3280$. Let me calculate that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that level simplifies to 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$. Wait, but the inner part we just calculated as 9841, so substituting in, we get $1 + 3*9841$. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that level is 29524.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers we have. The original problem has eight layers of 3(...), right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time we move out, we're adding another layer. Let me recount the layers to make sure I haven't missed any.\n\nOriginal expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. There's the innermost (1+3), then each time we add another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, that's one layer, then each additional layer adds another 3(...). So, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, starting from the innermost, let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, perhaps writing down each step more carefully.\n\nLet me define each step as n=1, n=2, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nn=1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nn=2: 1 + 3*(n=1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nn=3: 1 + 3*(n=2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nn=4: 1 + 3*(n=3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nn=5: 1 + 3*(n=4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nn=6: 1 + 3*(n=5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nn=7: 1 + 3*(n=6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nn=8: 1 + 3*(n=7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so after n=8, we have the outermost 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*(n=8), which is 3*9841.\n\nWait, so when I computed up to n=8 as 9841, then the entire expression is 3*9841. So, 3*9841 is 29523. So, the final answer would be 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went up to n=8 as 9841, then I thought the next step would be 1 + 3*9841, which gave me 29524, but now I'm thinking that perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the number of layers. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with how many layers? Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers of 3*(...). Let me see: the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds a 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we have a 3*(...). So, how many 3*(...) are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3*(1+3))\n3. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so perhaps each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of 3*(...) layers is 8, since the original expression has 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I went up to n=8 as 9841, and then the final step was 3*9841, which is 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought I had 9 layers, I ended up with 29524, which seems to be a mistake. So perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nLet me try to approach this methodically. Let me write down each step, starting from the innermost and moving outward, numbering each step as n=1, n=2, ..., up to n=8.\n\nn=1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nn=2: 1 + 3*(n=1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nn=3: 1 + 3*(n=2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nn=4: 1 + 3*(n=3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nn=5: 1 + 3*(n=4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nn=6: 1 + 3*(n=5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nn=7: 1 + 3*(n=6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nn=8: 1 + 3*(n=7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(n=8), which is 3*9841.\n\nCalculating that: 9841 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n8*3 = 24 +1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n9*3 = 27 +2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing that down: 29523.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought I had gone up to n=9, I had 29524, which was incorrect. So, I think the correct answer is 29523.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each step follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me denote a_n as the value at step n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute a_8 again:\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let me compute 3280 * 3.\n\n3280 * 3:\n\n3000*3 = 9000\n\n200*3 = 600\n\n80*3 = 240\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, a_8 is indeed 9841.\n\nThen, 3*a_8 = 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, yes, 29523 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another expression that looks like 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, the next level is (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, now that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3*(13)). Hmm, let's calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that simplifies to 40. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next level up. Let me try to keep track of each step.\n\nSo far, I have:\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Then: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLet me continue this process. The next level would be (1 + 3*40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*121). Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. Then, the next level is (1 + 3*364). Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's getting big quickly.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*1093). Let me calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then, the next level is (1 + 3*3280). So, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wow, that's a large number. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next step. So far, so good.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the next level is (1 + 3*29524). Calculating that: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Okay, so that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost parentheses, the next expression is (1 + 3*88573). Let me see: 3*88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. So, that simplifies to 265720.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed a level. Let me count how many times I did this. Starting from the innermost, each step is a layer, so let's count the number of opening parentheses. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses inside each other, each starting with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers. Let me recount my steps to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n2. 1+3*4 = 13\n3. 1+3*13 = 40\n4. 1+3*40 = 121\n5. 1+3*121 = 364\n6. 1+3*364 = 1093\n7. 1+3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1+3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1+3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after nine steps, I end up with 29524. But in my initial counting, I went up to 265720, which would be the tenth step. But since there are only nine layers, I think I went one step too far. Let me correct that. So, after nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*29524 is 88572, right? Wait, no, that can't be. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write down the problem again and count the number of times the expression 1+3(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)), so the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, and each layer adds another 1+3*previous. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps? But the original problem has nine layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps the outermost 3*(...) is the tenth step. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is different. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times this occurs. Each time, it's a new layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the structure is 3*(...), where the ... is the nine-layer expression. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524: Let's see, 29524*3. Let's compute:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check each step again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3*(...), where ... is nine layers of (1+3*(...)). So, the total computation is correct as per my steps. So, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572, which confirms my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each step involves computing \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost nine layers, we get the result \\(29524\\). The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: $1 + 3 = 4$. \n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$. \n\nOkay, so now the next layer is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that. \n\nStep 2: Compute $1 + 3(4)$. First, do the multiplication: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nSo now, the expression is: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))$. \n\nMoving one layer out, the next expression to compute is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me do that.\n\nStep 3: Compute $1 + 3(13)$. 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo the expression now becomes: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))))$. \n\nContinuing this way, the next step is to compute $1 + 3(40)$.\n\nStep 4: Compute $1 + 3(40)$. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nUpdating the expression: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))))$. \n\nNext up is $1 + 3(121)$.\n\nStep 5: Compute $1 + 3(121)$. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNow, the expression is: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))))$. \n\nMoving out another layer, compute $1 + 3(364)$.\n\nStep 6: Compute $1 + 3(364)$. 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nUpdating the expression: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))$. \n\nNext, compute $1 + 3(1093)$.\n\nStep 7: Compute $1 + 3(1093)$. 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNow, the expression is: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))$. \n\nMoving out, compute $1 + 3(3280)$.\n\nStep 8: Compute $1 + 3(3280)$. 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nUpdating the expression: $3(1 + 3(9841))$. \n\nNext, compute $1 + 3(9841)$.\n\nStep 9: Compute $1 + 3(9841)$. 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the expression is: $3(29524)$. \n\nFinally, compute this last multiplication.\n\nStep 10: Compute $3*29524$. Let me do this multiplication carefully. \n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000. Adding that to 60000 gives 87000.\nNext, 3*500 = 1500. Adding that gives 88500.\nThen, 3*24 = 72. Adding that gives 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check the multiplication again because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. It's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate somewhere. Let me go through the steps again quickly.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it right. Each step builds upon the previous one, and each multiplication and addition seems correct. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, like peeling an onion layer by layer. Let me write it down step by step to visualize it better.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, let me check. The structure is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, moving outward each time, multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step outward is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me label each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, let me count. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that, so Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe that's a good way to structure it.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29,000 * 3 is 87,000, and 524 * 3 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about it.\n\nWait, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, etc. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the general formula. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4.\n\nWe found the homogeneous solution as A*3^n, and the particular solution as C=-1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nThen, using a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A=4.5 => A=1.5, which is 3/2. So, yes, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, following a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find a general formula for each layer, leading us to compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   Each layer \\(n\\) is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of layer } n-1)\\).\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Final Computation:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is 1+3, right? Let's write that down. So, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me check. If I have 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3*4, yeah, that's 1 + 12, which is 13. Okay, so moving outward, the next layer would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, is there a pattern here? Let me see:\n\nAfter first step: 4\n\nSecond step: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThird step: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nFourth step: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me compute each step carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each step properly to avoid confusion. Let me think: the original expression is a series of nested 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until there are nine layers, I think. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count: starting from the first ( after the first 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. So, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many (1+3(...)) are there? Let me count each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3. So, from the innermost, each step out adds a new 1+3. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3, so how many layers? Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nEach time you go out one layer, you add another 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1+3, and there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting after the first 3: (1 + 3(... So, each ( adds a new layer. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, right? Because each ( starts a new layer, and the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another. So, if I have 8 opening parentheses, that means 8 layers beyond the first 3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me write it out step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, then the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me recount the layers because I'm a bit confused about how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is 4. Let's call this Layer1.\n\n2. The next layer is 1+3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer2.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer3.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer4.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer5.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer6.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer7.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer8.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Layer9.\n\nSo, after computing up to Layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The outermost expression is 3*(...), so yes, after computing up to Layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nInnermost: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next ( starts Layer1: 1+3.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, each adding a new layer. So, that would be 8 layers beyond the initial 3.\n\nWait, that would mean that the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4.\n\nThen, Layer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the value is 9841.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841.\n\nWait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I overcounted the layers earlier. Let me see: if there are 8 layers beyond the initial 3, then the total expression is 3*(Layer8).\n\nSo, let me recast:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841.\n\nSo, 3*9841: Let me compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3.\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number:\n\n9 (thousands place), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units).\n\nSo:\n\n1*3=3.\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2, making it 29323? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, let me compute it correctly:\n\nWait, 9841 * 3:\n\nCompute each digit from right to left.\n\n1: 1*3=3.\n\n4: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8: 8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9: 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since we're done with digits, we add the carryover 2, making it 29 at the beginning.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, 9841*3=29523.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 9 layers, I had 3*29524=88572, but that seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nStarting after the first 3, the first ( is for the first 1+3.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many ( are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter 3(1+3(...), the first ( is for the first 1+3.\n\nThen, the next ( is for the next 1+3, and so on.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3: that's the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. After 3(1+3(...\n\nThen, each ( inside adds another layer. Let me count how many ( are present.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of 1+3 terms. Each 1+3 is a layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time you have a 1+3, that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\nInnermost: 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1+3*(1+3).\n\nThen, next layer is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nEach time you move out a layer, you add another 1+3. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nIn the original expression, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, moving out, each ( adds another 1+3.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 1+3 is a separate term, and each is nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nLet me count each 1+3:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3.\n\n2. Next: 1+3(...).\n\n3. Next: 1+3(...).\n\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the first ( starts the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many ( are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. After 3: ( starts layer 1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another ( starts layer 2.\n\n3. Then, another ( for layer 3.\n\n4. Another ( for layer 4.\n\n5. Another ( for layer 5.\n\n6. Another ( for layer 6.\n\n7. Another ( for layer 7.\n\n8. Another ( for layer 8.\n\n9. Then, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time you have a ( after the initial 3, that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3: that's layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, the next ( is layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the last ( before the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(... => layer 1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another ( => layer 2.\n\n3. Then, another ( => layer 3.\n\n4. Then, another ( => layer 4.\n\n5. Another ( => layer 5.\n\n6. Another ( => layer 6.\n\n7. Another ( => layer 7.\n\n8. Another ( => layer 8.\n\n9. Then, the innermost is 1+3, which would be layer 9.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier with 8 layers, I got 3*9841=29523, but if there are 9 layers, then the last layer would be 1+3*29524=88573, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, and see where it leads.\n\nSo, let's try that again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 8 layers, I had 3*9841=29523, but that was incorrect because I stopped at 8 layers, not 9.\n\nSo, the correct approach is that there are 9 layers, each adding a new 1+3, so the final value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the number of opening parentheses. Let me double-check the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. After 3, the first ( is layer 1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another ( is layer 2.\n\n3. Another ( is layer 3.\n\n4. Another ( is layer 4.\n\n5. Another ( is layer 5.\n\n6. Another ( is layer 6.\n\n7. Another ( is layer 7.\n\n8. Another ( is layer 8.\n\n9. The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I first did it, I thought the number of layers was 8, but now I'm seeing it's 9 layers, leading to 88572.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na1 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, indeed, up to a9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nAt n=1, a1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but our a1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nAt n=1, a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4.

    "text": " Maybe it's a recursive kind of thing, or perhaps it's just a matter of working from the inside out. Let me try to parse it.\n\nLet me write it down again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous parentheses. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and working my way out. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3)\n2. Use that result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Continue this process, moving outward each time, until I reach the outermost parentheses.\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's start with the innermost parentheses.\n\n**Step 1: Compute (1 + 3)**\nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) where the innermost part is now 4. So, the next layer is:\n\n**Step 2: Compute (1 + 3*(4))**\nWait, let me make sure. The next parentheses out is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, if the previous result was 4, then it's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer gives us 13.\n\nNow, moving outward another layer, we have:\n\n**Step 3: Compute (1 + 3*(13))**\nAgain, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, this layer results in 40.\n\nContinuing outward, next layer:\n\n**Step 4: Compute (1 + 3*(40))**\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n**Step 5: Compute (1 + 3*(121))**\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that calculation. 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nMoving outward:\n\n**Step 6: Compute (1 + 3*(364))**\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n**Step 7: Compute (1 + 3*(1093))**\n3*1093: Hmm, let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the multiplication:\n\n1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is indeed 3280. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\n**Step 8: Compute (1 + 3*(3280))**\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWait, hold on, that's 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nMoving outward:\n\n**Step 9: Compute (1 + 3*(9841))**\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward again, but wait, how many layers do we have? Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(result). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3(1 + 3(...) corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), each time another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the problem, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), and that ... has 8 more layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nFirst: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe the number of layers is 9? Because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each step out adds another layer. Let me check the original expression.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until the outermost is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1 + Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 3*(Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1 + Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 3*(Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1 + Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 3*(Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1 + Layer 8) \u2192 Layer 9\n10. 3*(Layer 9) \u2192 Layer 10\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by the 9th layer. Therefore, the computation needs to be done 9 times, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to step 9, resulting in 29524. Then, the outermost is 3*(29524). So, step 10 would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in my initial calculation, I went up to step 9, which gave me 29524, and then the final step is multiplying that by 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscalculated earlier because I thought the outermost was already included, but no, the outermost is 3*(result of step 9). So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, let me re-examine:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524.\n\nSo, step 10: 3*29524.\n\nTherefore, the total result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that computation again because it's crucial.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer:\n\n1. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n2. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n3. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n4. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n5. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n6. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n7. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n8. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n9. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I started, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions, how many are there?\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting after the first 3, each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 1\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)):\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 2\n\nContinuing:\n\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u2192 3\n\n4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2192 4\n\n5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) \u2192 5\n\n6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) \u2192 6\n\n7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 7\n\n8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 8\n\n9. 3(1 + 3) \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Therefore, the initial 3 is multiplied by the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3*(result of 8th layer)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to step 9, which was the 9th layer, and then multiplied by 3, which would be the 10th step. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total computation is correct, resulting in 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can compute this in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the result without computing each step manually.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way out.

The innermost part is (1+3), right? So let's compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Then, moving one level out, the next part is (1+3*(that result)). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Hmm, okay, so the next level is 13. Then the next level out would be 1 + 3*13.

Then, moving one level out: (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Then: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Then: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Then: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n- 9*3=27, write down 27\nWait, that seems off. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\nFinally, there's no more digits, so the carryover 2 becomes 2.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 0, carryover 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n2 + 2 = 4 +1=5\nSo 58048.\n\nThen add another 29524 to 58048:\n\n58048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2=6 +1=7\n0 +5=5\n8 +9=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n5 +2=7 +1=8\nSo the result is 87572? Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let me check 29524 *3 again. Maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000 +27000=87000\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 *3=88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps when computing the inner levels. Maybe I messed up one of the steps in the recursion.\n\nLet me go through each level again step by step:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 +12 =13\n3. Level 3: (1 +3*13)=1+39=40\n4. Level4: (1 +3*40)=1+120=121\n5. Level5: (1 +3*121)=1+363=364\n6. Level6: (1 +3*364)=1+1092=1093\n7. Level7: (1 +3*1093)=1+3279=3280\n8. Level8: (1 +3*3280)=1+9840=9841\n9. Level9: (1 +3*9841)=1+29523=29524\n10. Level10: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct each time. So each step, I take the result from the previous level, multiply by 3, add 1, and so on. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 levels inside. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each time I have a (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. From the innermost, there are 9 such sections, right? Because each time, the expression is 3*(something), and that something is (1+3*(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let's see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So the number of times we have (1 + 3*(...)) is 9 times, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each step is (1 + 3*previous), done 9 times, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo that's 9 levels of (1 + 3*previous), starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc., up to 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. So if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is (1+3)=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels of (1 + 3*...), so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative step-by-step computation and derived a formula using linear recurrence relations, and both methods led me to the same answer. So I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost level outward. Each level follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the result of the previous level. By applying this recursively and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Next Level Out:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems logical because the innermost part will have the fewest layers, so it should be easier to compute first.\n\nLet me try to write down each step. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+4)))))))))$. Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, the next layer out is the one before that, which is (1+3(1+4)). Wait, no, actually, I think I need to correct that. Let me check again. The original expression is a series of nested 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1+3*(that result). So, perhaps I should think of each step as computing the innermost parentheses first and then substituting that value into the next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the layers to make it clearer. Let me see: The expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9: (1+3) = 4. Then layer 8 would be 1 + 3*(layer 9 result). Then layer 7 would be 1 + 3*(layer 8 result), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is layer 1, and then multiply by 3. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, after computing Layer 1 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because that's a lot of computation, and I might have made an error somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations in the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but actually, in our case, the innermost is a_9 = 1 + 3, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on until a_1, then the total expression is 3*a_1.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, until a_9 = 1 + 3.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model it as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, the innermost layer is a_9 = 1 + 3, so a_9 = 4.\n\nThen, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it more formally.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is given by a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^n + c/(1 - k), assuming k \u2260 1.\n\nIn our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, the general solution would be a_n = (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^n + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nSimplify: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (a_0 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the indexing is a bit different. We have a_9 = 4, and we're working our way up to a_1. So, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's consider the innermost layer as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, that might complicate things, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. But I think that might not align with the standard approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from layer 1 being the innermost, so a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in that case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as we computed before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4, we can compute up to a_9.\n\nBut actually, in our problem, the outermost layer is a_9, which is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let's see if the closed-form formula can help us compute a_9 more directly.\n\nUsing the general solution for the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say at n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct because (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form solution, we can compute a_9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. **Layer 1:**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 1 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each \"1+3\" is inside another set, so maybe there are 9 layers? Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Wait, the expression is 3 followed by a bunch of (1+3(...)). Each time, it's 3 multiplied by a (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, because I see 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then inside it's (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...)) until the innermost is (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are 9 layers. So I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add a layer. So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(...)\", which in the expression is 9 times. So Layer 9 is the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nSo the total expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Maybe I should go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. So the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I do these layers, I might have miscounted. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could help me compute this without having to do each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2=1+3*L_1=1+3*4=13.\n\nUsing the closed-form, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.\n\nSo the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula without going through each layer.\n\nSince L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without calculating each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify with the formula, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, so that would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, then this next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this would be 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is again 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 40, so 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(121). So, 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that: 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n- 4*3=12, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n- 5*3=15, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n- 9*3=27, carryover 2\n- 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n- 9*3=27, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n- 0*3=0\n- 0*3=0\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that: 3*88573. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\n88573*3:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number: 8 8 5 7 3.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, there are no more digits, so we write down the carryover 2.\n\nWait, so that would make it 265719? Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3*3=9, so units place is 9.\n\n- 3*7=21, so tens place is 1, carryover 2.\n\n- 3*5=15 +2=17, so hundreds place is 7, carryover 1.\n\n- 3*8=24 +1=25, so thousands place is 5, carryover 2.\n\n- 3*8=24 +2=26, so ten-thousands place is 6, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 at the beginning, making it 265719. So, 3*88573=265719.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nWait, let me confirm that: 88573*3. Let me compute it as 88,573 * 3.\n\nCompute 80,000*3=240,000\n\n8,000*3=24,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them together: 240,000 +24,000=264,000; +1,500=265,500; +210=265,710; +9=265,719. Then, 1 + 265,719=265,720. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*265720. Let's see, 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. So, adding these together: 600,000 +180,000=780,000; +15,000=795,000; +2,100=797,100; +60=797,160. So, 3*265,720=797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 265,720*3:\n\n265,720 *3:\n\n- 200,000*3=600,000\n\n- 60,000*3=180,000\n\n- 5,000*3=15,000\n\n- 700*3=2,100\n\n- 20*3=60\n\nAdding them: 600,000 +180,000=780,000; +15,000=795,000; +2,100=797,100; +60=797,160. Then, 1 + 797,160=797,161. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer, which is the outermost parentheses, the expression is 1 + 3*(797,161). Let's compute that: 3*797,161. Let me calculate this step by step.\n\n797,161 *3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n700,000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n2,100,000 +270,000=2,370,000\n\n+21,000=2,391,000\n\n+300=2,391,300\n\n+180=2,391,480\n\n+3=2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161=2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me confirm that: 797,161 *3.\n\nCompute 700,000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000 \u2192 2,100,000 +270,000=2,370,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000 \u2192 2,370,000 +21,000=2,391,000\n\n100*3=300 \u2192 2,391,000 +300=2,391,300\n\n60*3=180 \u2192 2,391,300 +180=2,391,480\n\n1*3=3 \u2192 2,391,480 +3=2,391,483\n\nThen, 1 + 2,391,483=2,391,484. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(that outermost result). So, the outermost result is 2,391,484, and we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*2,391,484.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n2,000,000*3=6,000,000\n\n300,000*3=900,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n1,000*3=3,000\n\n400*3=1,200\n\n80*3=240\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 2,391,484 is 2,000,000 + 391,484.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 2,391,484 *3:\n\nCompute 2,000,000*3=6,000,000\n\n391,484*3: Let's compute that.\n\n300,000*3=900,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n1,000*3=3,000\n\n400*3=1,200\n\n80*3=240\n\n4*3=12\n\nSo, adding these together:\n\n900,000 +270,000=1,170,000\n\n+3,000=1,173,000\n\n+1,200=1,174,200\n\n+240=1,174,440\n\n+12=1,174,452\n\nSo, 391,484*3=1,174,452\n\nThen, 6,000,000 +1,174,452=7,174,452\n\nSo, 3*2,391,484=7,174,452\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again:\n\n2,391,484 *3:\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 7,174,452. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 7,174,452.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps because this is a long calculation and it's easy to make an error. Let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\n3. Next: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\n4. Next: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\n5. Next: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=1+88572=88573\n\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=1+265719=265720\n\n12. Next: 1+3*265720=1+797160=797161\n\n13. Next: 1+3*797161=1+2391483=2391484\n\n14. Finally, 3*2391484=7,174,452\n\nWait, that's 14 steps, which seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, moving outward from the innermost parentheses. So, the final result is 7,174,452.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check with a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers after the initial 3. Wait, let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nWe have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, this formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's the value we got earlier for a_9, which was 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, but wait, no, that can't be because earlier we had more layers. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so the number of a_n terms is 9. So, a_9 would be the innermost, and then the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step, we had a_1 = 4, a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, but that doesn't match our previous final result of 7,174,452. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*29524=88572, but in our step-by-step earlier, we went up to 3*a_9=7,174,452, which is way larger.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, perhaps my initial assumption about the number of layers is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of (1 + 3(...)) in the original expression. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3*...). Let me count the number of times (1 + 3*...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, each additional (1 + 3*...) adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*...). So, a_9 would be the innermost, and then the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572, which contradicts our earlier step-by-step calculation where we ended up with 7,174,452.\n\nThis suggests that I made a mistake in my initial approach. Wait, perhaps the formula counts the number of layers differently. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers. So, if I have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches the formula.\n\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I ended up with 7,174,452, which is 3*(3^{13} -1)/2= (3^{14} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{14}=4,782,969, so (4,782,969 -3)/2=4,782,966/2=2,391,483, which is not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3*...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), so let's count how many times this occurs.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 14 layers, which must be incorrect because the expression only has 9 layers. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers. Let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer3) \u2192 Layer4\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer4) \u2192 Layer5\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer5) \u2192 Layer6\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer6) \u2192 Layer7\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer7) \u2192 Layer8\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer8) \u2192 Layer9\n10. 3*(Layer9) \u2192 Total expression\n\nWait, so the total expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*(Layer13)=7,174,452, which suggests I had an extra 4 layers. That must be a mistake. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original problem. Let me count again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1 + 3*(...) appears.\n\nLet me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. ...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because there are 9 instances of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but when I wrote it out earlier, I had 9 layers, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 14 steps. That suggests I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the expression as a tree. Each (1 + 3*(...)) is a node with two children: 1 and 3*(...), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of times (1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me write the expression with indices:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3)\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nTotal expression: 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, and the total expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 14 layers, which suggests that I was counting the outermost 3*(Layer9) as another layer, but actually, the total expression is just 3*(Layer9), which is the 10th step, not another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Let me recount:\n\nIn my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 3*(Layer9)=7,174,452, but according to the formula, it's 3*(Layer9)=88572.\n\nSo, I must have miscounted the number of layers in the original problem. It seems that the correct number of layers is 9, leading to the total expression being 3*(Layer9)=88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 3*(Layer13)=7,174,452, which suggests that I was considering 13 layers, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the number of (1 + 3*(...)) in the original expression.\n\nLet me write the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(...)\n3. 1+3*(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the total expression is 3*(Layer9)=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 7,174,452, which is way larger. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Wait, let me check the formula again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. Layer1=4\n\n2. Layer2=13\n\n3. Layer3=40\n\n4. Layer4=121\n\n5. Layer5=364\n\n6. Layer6=1093\n\n7. Layer7=3280\n\n8. Layer8=9841\n\n9. Layer9=29524\n\n10. Total expression=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but earlier I had more layers because I continued beyond Layer9. That was incorrect. The original problem only has 9 layers, so the total expression is 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nSo, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I continued beyond Layer9, which isn't part of the original problem. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 1"

That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write it down again to visualize better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. So, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). The innermost result was 4, so 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.

Maybe if I list each level, it'll be clearer.\n\nLet me assign each level a number from the inside out. Let's say:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me count how many levels there are. The original expression is 3 multiplied by a series of (1 + 3(...)). Each time, it's another layer. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and each adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count how many times we have \"1 + 3(...)\" nested inside each other. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.

Then each time we go out, it's another level. So, how many levels do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is an opening. So:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFrom the initial 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new level. So, that would mean 9 layers.

Let me try to write out each level carefully.\n\nStarting with Level 1 as the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Level 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the result up to Level 9.\n\nSo, the total expression would be 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. I think I might have miscounted how many levels there are. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's level 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous level). So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new level. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4 (Level 1)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 13 (Level 2)\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 40 (Level 3)\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 121 (Level 4)\n5. Next, 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 364 (Level 5)\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1093 (Level 6)\n7. Next, 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 3280 (Level 7)\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 9841 (Level 8)\n9. Next, 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 29524 (Level 9)\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 levels inside the outermost 3. So, the outermost is Level 10, but it's just 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first started, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I counted the \"1 + 3(\" instances, I saw 9 of them, which would make Level 9 the innermost? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the count. Let me think differently. Let's see how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4 (Level 1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 13 (Level 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 40 (Level 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 121 (Level 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 364 (Level 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1093 (Level 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 3280 (Level 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 9841 (Level 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 29524 (Level 9)\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*(Level 9) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3, making the total expression 3*(Level 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, so I think my initial calculation was correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a*(a + a*(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). Let me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a_n, perhaps I can compute a_9 directly without computing each level step by step.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, that's a neat formula for a_n.\n\nNow, since we need a_9, let's compute that:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^10: Let's compute it again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, verifying with both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is $1+3$. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 equals 4. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(4)$. Wait, because the innermost was 4, so the next one would be 1 plus 3 times that 4. So, 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Let me write that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nOkay, moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nHmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me continue this process step by step because it's repetitive, but maybe there's a shortcut or a formula I can use later.\n\nSo, the next layer after 40 would be $1 + 3(40)$. Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(121)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\nMoving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(364)$. Calculating: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's 1093.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nNow, the next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is $1 + 3(3280)$. Calculating that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(9841)$. Let's compute this: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3$ multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 times 29524. Hmm, let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\n3 times 29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 times 3:\n- 4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 times 3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 times 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- The first digit is 2 times 3 is 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 times 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 times 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 x 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 x 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me do it another way just to be sure. Maybe using another method, like breaking down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 x 3 = 60000\n9000 x 3 = 27000\n500 x 3 = 1500\n20 x 3 = 60\n4 x 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Because when I computed each layer, I got up to 29524, but let me recount how many layers there are to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on, until we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1 + 3( ... ), and each time, the next layer is another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost 3 times that: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so I think I counted 9 layers inside the initial 3( ... ). So, starting from the innermost, I computed 9 layers, each time getting a new value, and then multiplied the 9th result by 3 to get the final answer. So, 88572 is the result.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps because if I made an error in one step, it would propagate through all the subsequent steps. So, let me verify each step again.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait a second, I just realized something. When I started, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I count the opening parentheses in the original problem, how many are there?\n\nLet me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3(...), which is another layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, each time I computed a layer, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check one more time each step.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was multiplying 3 by 29524, I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me verify that again because that's the final step, and if that's wrong, the whole answer is wrong.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can use another approach, like using the distributive property or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking back at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, if I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\nand so on, up to a_9, which is 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of a_1, but that might be more complicated. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's find A and B.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula for a_2: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plugging A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3/2 * 3^{n} is (3^{n+1})/2, right? So, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for n = 1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue outward:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9.

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because the innermost part will give me the smallest number, and then each layer will build upon that. So, let me write it out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). That seems straightforward. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting the previous result, which is 4, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting 13, it's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*121). Calculating: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, getting bigger each time. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*364). Let's see: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's a jump. So, 1093.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280.\n\nContinuing: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's a pretty big number. So, 9841.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let's calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, 29524.\n\nAnother layer out: (1 + 3*29524). Calculating: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573 is 265,719, plus 1 is 265,720. So, that's 265,720.\n\nWait a second, but the original problem is 3 times all of that. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result we just got, which is 265,720. So, 3*265,720. Let me calculate that. 265,720 times 3: 200,000*3 is 600,000, 60,000*3 is 180,000, 5,000*3 is 15,000, 700*3 is 2,100, and 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000; plus 15,000 is 795,000; plus 2,100 is 797,100; plus 60 is 797,160. So, 3*265,720 is 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573. Correct.\n\nNext:1 +3*88573=1 +265,719=265,720. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(265,720). Let me compute 265,720 *3 again. 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600k + 180k = 780k; +15k=795k; +2,100=797,100; +60=797,160. So, 797,160. That seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have missed a layer. Let me count the number of layers to make sure. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s multiplied. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each layer is a multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, 265,720. So, that's 10 layers, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the original expression has 9 \"1+3(\" after the first 3. Wait, no, let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write the expression as a series of nested terms. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\na_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265,720\n\nSo, that's 11 layers, from a_1 to a_11. Then the entire expression is 3*a_11, which is 3*265,720 = 797,160.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each \"1+3\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, that's 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, in the original expression, how many 1+3 terms are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of 1+3 terms is 9, because after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)). Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1, and each subsequent layer adds another. So, the total number of layers is 10? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time we have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3*(Layer8))\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each being 1+3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost. So, perhaps my initial count was wrong. Let me recount.\n\nIf the innermost is (1+3) = 4, that's layer1.\n\nThen, layer2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would be 3*29524=88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 11 layers. Hmm, so I think I might have overcounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n(1+3)\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n(1+3) [layer1]\n\nThen, moving out, it's (1+3*(layer1)) [layer2]\n\nThen, (1+3*(layer2)) [layer3]\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, layer1 is (1+3)=4\n\nlayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nlayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nlayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nlayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nlayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nlayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 11 layers, but that seems inconsistent with the count here. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including the outermost 3*(...) as a layer, which it's not, because it's just a multiplication, not another 1+3(...). So, the layers are only the 1+3*(...) parts, which are 9 layers. So, the total expression is 3*(layer9) where layer9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to a_11=265,720, which would imply 11 layers, but that seems incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) [layer1]\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is (1+3*(previous layer)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Wait, no, the count is a bit different. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers of 1+3*(...), plus the outermost 3*.\n\nSo, in that case, the layers are 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So, layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but that seems incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting one too many layers. So, the correct total should be 88572, not 797,160.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me write out the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I overcounted earlier by including the outermost 3*(...) as a layer, which it's not. It's just the final multiplication by 3 after computing all the layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this by another method. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1.\n\nSolving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but that was incorrect. So, I think I've confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers. The correct number of layers is 9, leading to the answer 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3) [layer1]\n\n2. (1+3(layer1)) [layer2]\n\n3. (1+3(layer2)) [layer3]\n\n4. (1+3(layer3)) [layer4]\n\n5. (1+3(layer4)) [layer5]\n\n6. (1+3(layer5)) [layer6]\n\n7. (1+3(layer6)) [layer7]\n\n8. (1+3(layer7)) [layer8]\n\n9. (1+3(layer8)) [layer9]\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, that's 9 layers of 1+3*(...), plus the outermost 3*.\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers inside the 3* is 9, leading to a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting one extra layer, leading to an incorrect total. The correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). After calculating each layer, we find that the innermost result is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After 9 layers, we reach the result 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\):\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n3. Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
