    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but that seems quite large. Let me verify each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me try another way to compute it to confirm. Alternatively, I can consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed as a constant, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the key was recognizing the recursive pattern and computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, using the formula for the linear recurrence relation gives the same result. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but with the formula, it's much faster, especially if there are more layers. But for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. I think I've got it now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, that's not right because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. There's no digit beyond that, so write 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29,524 *3: Let's compute 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Wait, that seems more accurate. Let me check: 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1=1+3=4. a_2=1+3a_1=1+12=13. a_3=1+3a_2=1+39=40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n=1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the number is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29,524 *3: 29,524 *3. Let's compute 30,000 *3=90,000. Then subtract (476*3)=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, which is Layer1, n=1: a_1=4. Then, Layer2 is a_2=13, which is n=2, and so on up to Layer9, which is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, either way, I get the same answer. Therefore, the result is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This forms a recurrence relation which I solved using standard techniques, finding a closed-form expression. Then, using that expression, I computed the value for the ninth layer and multiplied by 3 to get the final result.

But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each computation. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Wait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so when you expand it, each term is 3^k where k is the number of multiplications. Let me try to see: Let's define S as the entire expression. Then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers. Wait, but that's not a standard geometric series because each term is nested. Alternatively, since we've already computed a closed-form formula, maybe it's better to stick with that.

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 0*3=0, write down 0. 2*3=6, write down 6. So putting it all together, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\n0*3=0, write 0.\n\n2*3=6, write 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, and when I multiply by 3, it should be 29524*3=88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524=59048, then +29524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that Layer 9 was correctly computed. Let me go back through each layer to check for any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(Layer 9). So the final answer should be 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s say a_n represents the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. The formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, it's 3^{10}, which is correct as 3^{10}=59049. So yes, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n0*3=0, write down 0.\n\n2*3=6, write down 6.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\n0\u00d73=0 \u2192 write 0.\n\n2\u00d73=6 \u2192 write 6.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me do it properly:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nNext: 0\u00d73=0 \u2192 write 0.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 \u2192 write 6.\n\nWait, but that would be 88572, right? Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carry1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\n0\u00d73=0.\n\n2\u00d73=6.\n\nSo writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n2 (from 4\u00d73=12)\n\n7 (from 2\u00d73+1=7)\n\n5 (from 5\u00d73=15)\n\n8 (from 9\u00d73+2=29, wait no, 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, so 8 carry2)\n\n8 (from 2\u00d73+2=8)\n\n5 (from 5\u00d73=15)\n\n8 (from 9\u00d73+1=28)\n\n8 (from 2\u00d73+2=8)\n\n0 (from 0\u00d73=0)\n\n6 (from 2\u00d73=6)\n\nWait, that seems off because the number of digits doesn't match. Let me try a different approach. Let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 +29524=59048\n\n59048 +29524=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524\u00d73=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the value at each layer follows a pattern, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Now, add the third 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because if I messed up any layer, the final answer will be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I could have recognized earlier, maybe a geometric series or something? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, that's 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be correct because 30000 * 3 is 90000, so 29524 * 3 should be just under 90,000. 88572 is indeed just under 90,000, so that seems plausible. Let me double-check with another method. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), so yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what happens when we expand it. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*1) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nWait, but when I compute a3, I get 40, which is 1 + 3*13 = 40, but if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be written as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or some recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nLet me denote Layer n as L_n.\n\nGiven that L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1 =59048 /2=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n4. **General Formula**: Using the recurrence relation, Layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Thus, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, 88,572. Wait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer computation again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Is there a pattern here? Let me see the ratio between each term: 13/4 = 3.25, 40/13 \u2248 3.077, 121/40 = 3.025, 364/121 \u2248 3.008, 1093/364 \u2248 3.000, 3280/1093 \u2248 3.000, 9841/3280 \u2248 3.000, 29524/9841 \u2248 3.000. So, as we go further out, the ratio approaches 3. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so as n increases, Ln \u2248 3*Ln-1. Therefore, for large n, Ln \u2248 3^n. But in this case, we have a finite number of layers, so maybe we can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for Ln. Let's define Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   \n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there a pattern here that could be represented by a geometric series or something? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term instead of computing each layer manually. Let me explore that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, according to the problem, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, especially since it's non-homogeneous. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can derive a formula for each layer using a recurrence relation. \n\n1. **Identify the recurrence relation**: Each layer \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Solve the recurrence**: The general solution is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute the outermost layer (Layer 9)**: \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation, substituting into the homogeneous and particular solutions, we can find that the particular solution is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers, but for 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have led to the formula, but since I didn't think of it initially, I did it step by step. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me do a quick check by computing a few layers again. Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3:88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify the layers again because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, either by computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think that's solid.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's consistent. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's a negative number, which doesn't make sense here because all our layers are positive. But in this case, each layer is finite, so it's a finite nested expression, not an infinite one. So, maybe the formula for a finite geometric series applies here. Let me recall that a finite geometric series has the form S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in our case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, maybe it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >= 2, and L_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_k. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, which is the outermost layer: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I've got it.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me verify each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each term is defined recursively. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In our case, k=3, c=1, and a_0 would be the initial term before a_1. Wait, but in our case, a_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0=1. Let me check. If a_0=1, then a_1=1 + 3*a_0=1 + 3*1=4, which matches. So, using the formula: a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n} *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2,187 3^8=6,561 3^9=19,683 3^{10}=59,049 So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, which would have been faster, but since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step made it clearer. I think I've got it right. Let me just recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, I found that the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is 13, 40, 121, 364, 1,093, 3,280, 9,841, and finally 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. I can also see that using the formula for the linear recurrence relation saved time and confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Wait, that's getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, then +9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, +9524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume n=0: Well, actually, the recurrence starts at n=1, so maybe we can find another condition. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since Layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off because when I compute 29524 * 3, it's actually 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. But wait, let me think again about the structure of the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, except the very outermost layer, which is 3 times the entire inner expression. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's see: starting from a_1 = 4, which is the innermost layer. Then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or the computations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me verify. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 29524. 8+4=12, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. 2+0=2. So 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, a_3 was 40, etc. So, this recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, I can recompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that all checks out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So a_1=1+3=4.\n\na_2=1+3a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1+3a_2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9=1 +3a_8.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 +3C \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1= A*3^1 -1/2 =3A -1/2=4.\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric progression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if we consider the entire expression as 3*a_9, then 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Then, each subsequent a_n is built using the previous term. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, after computing up to a_9, we have a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D by assuming a steady state where a_n = D. Then, D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 88572 without the comma. But in any case, that seems to be the correct result after carefully computing each step and verifying with both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(...), so the outermost 3 multiplies the innermost a_9. So, the final result is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3*a1, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1. Solving for K: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it works. For n=1: a1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9=29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer. Just to be thorough, I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*(a9), and a9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute it layer by layer, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I consistently get 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each time, it's 3(...), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. From the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), and so on. Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Then Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2). Each time, we have a new layer until we reach Layer9, which is the outermost before the final 3. So, 9 layers, each computed step by step. So, I think my calculation is correct. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each term is defined recursively. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, and since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation approach, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I think I've considered multiple methods to verify the solution, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we confirm that the ninth layer results in 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize the pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it explicitly. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3 + B. Then, for n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nThen, substituting A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern right away, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear function. Each time, the coefficient of 3 is increasing exponentially, which is why the numbers get large so quickly. But using the formula is much faster and avoids computing each layer individually.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula, I arrive at the same final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows the use of a formula to find the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 = 88572? Let me check with another method to make sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But since there are no more digits, write 27 as 27. So the result would be 88572. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, right? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. The problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I started from the innermost layer and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. After computing the innermost nine layers, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I double-checked each step, and the calculations seem correct. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me write it out vertically:\n\n    29524\n  x     3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 3*4=12, write 2, carry 1. 3*2=6 +1=7. 3*5=15, write 5, carry 1. 3*9=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 3*2=6 +1=7.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So layers 1 through 9: 1: 4, 2:13, 3:40, 4:121, 5:364, 6:1093, 7:3280, 8:9841, 9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve it using recurrence relations. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I approached it both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the computation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL_2 =1 +3*L_1=1+12=13\n\nL_3=1 +3*L_2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. To solve this, we can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n =3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD =3*D +1\n\nD -3D=1\n\n-2D=1 => D= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized the pattern and used a recursive formula to find the closed-form solution, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that seems messy. Maybe I should do it more carefully. Let me write it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nThe next digit is 9, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, I think I miscounted. Let me count the digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 (tens place) \u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5 (hundreds) \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 (thousands) \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12: write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7: write 7.\n5 \u00d73=15: write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo yes, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d73: Let me compute it another way to verify.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d73=60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and make sure each layer was computed correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute the expression in another way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nFirst, plug in n=1: L_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B\n\nWe also need another equation. Let's consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve it iteratively.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nFrom earlier computations:\n\nL_1=4\n\nL_2=13\n\nL_3=40\n\nL_4=121\n\nL_5=364\n\nL_6=1093\n\nL_7=3280\n\nL_8=9841\n\nL_9=29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous minus something? Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom L_1=4 to L_2=13: 4*3=12 +1=13\n\nFrom L_2=13 to L_3=40:13*3=39 +1=40\n\nSimilarly, 40*3=120 +1=121, etc.\n\nSo, indeed, each L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K +1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3, L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my computations, let me verify a couple more layers using the formula.\n\nFor example, L_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the formula holds.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut regardless, using the recurrence relation and solving it gave me the correct result, and verifying with the formula confirmed it.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. The outermost layer, Layer 9, is computed as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe it's better to do it step by step. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\nBut wait, the number is 29524, which is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, let me write it correctly:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units)\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\nSo, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be more than 29524. Wait, maybe I missed the digits. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands place is 8\nSo the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572 Correct. Okay, so each step checks out. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations:\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plugging A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids repetitive calculations. But since I was able to compute each layer manually without error, both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until we reach the ninth layer, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, 3*29524: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So the digits are 7,8,7,5,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me write it down properly: 29524 * 3:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n  88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Then, after computing the ninth layer, I multiplied by 3 again. Each step seemed to check out. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the final layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
