So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the number is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So the final result is 88572. But wait, earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524. Is that correct? Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So yes, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer, which leads to exponential growth, hence the large number. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. So, just to recap, by breaking down the nested expression layer by layer, computing each step carefully, and then verifying with a general formula for such recurrence relations, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, this seems like a lot, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let me add those: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing one more time, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Wait, the structure of the expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general form, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. To be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6.

Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked each step, and the formula approach also confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\nNo more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me verify that because I might have messed up the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent 1+3*(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1+3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1+3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1+3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1+3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1+3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 9 layers inside, plus the outermost 3*. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that was correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's a shorter version with only 3 layers inside. Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should be correct. So, going back, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer to see if my pattern holds. Let's take the next layer after Layer 1: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n10. **Final Step**: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (as calculated above). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.

Each layer checks out, and the final multiplication is correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer step by step. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I didn't try to find a formula or anything because the pattern wasn't immediately obvious, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step was feasible. I wonder if there's a pattern or a geometric series here, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence might give a closed-form expression, but since it's only nine terms, computing each step was straightforward. However, for larger numbers of layers, it would be useful to find a formula. But in this case, since it's manageable, step-by-step computation worked fine. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is following the pattern of a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general form is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. So, yes, the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, I think I messed up somewhere because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me see. Because a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4. Let me test this formula. For n=1: a_1=(3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, since each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. So, the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Let me see if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence relation is linear: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is a non-homogeneous equation, we can find a particular solution. Alternatively, we can observe that each term is of the form a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test it for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm off by a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * something. Wait, let's compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 4\na_2 = 13 = 4*3 +1?\nWait, 4*3=12 +1=13, yes.\na_3 = 40 = 13*3 +1=39 +1=40\na_4 = 121 = 40*3 +1=120 +1=121\nYes, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B +1\nB - 3B =1\n-2B =1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct.\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Great, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if each layer follows a certain sequence. Let's list out the values I got for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, mathematically, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524 as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(layer 9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of Layer 9. So, yes, that would be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me recall that for such a recurrence, the general solution can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually.

The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the recursive approach using the formula also gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). This recurrence relation can be solved to find a general formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the innermost layer (\\( n = 9 \\)):\n\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Let me do it again more carefully. 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7. Write down 7.\n\n5 *3 =15.

So, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.

So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by finding the general formula for the nth layer. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step until reaching the outermost layer. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a general formula, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution or compute it iteratively as I did before. Since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nThe expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the 9th layer.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution gives me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to some terms.\n\nBut in this case, since it's nested 9 times, it might not be a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps it can be expressed as such.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try expanding the innermost part first.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait a second, that's interesting. So each layer seems to add another power of 3.\n\nSo, Layer n: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nBut wait, let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nYes, so Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but starting from k=0? Wait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nBut the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the formula we derived earlier for a_n.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms the result again.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, all steps check out.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since the expression is finite with nine layers, the recursive approach worked well.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Okay, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 +3 =4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 +3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n -3*a_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C -3*C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer9, which is the outermost one, is a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, we can think of it as 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed before. Alternatively, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Maybe I should write it out:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, all the layers check out. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since I don't recognize an immediate formula for this kind of nested expression, step-by-step computation seems the way to go. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it that way to confirm. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a recurrence relation approach, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation method, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x    3\n   -------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 3*4 is 12, write 2, carry 1. 3*2 is 6 +1=7. 3*5 is 15, write 5, carry 1. 3*9 is 27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 3*2 is 6 +2=8. 3*9 is 27, write 7, carry 2. 3*5 is 15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 3*4 is 12 +1=13, write 13. Wait, no, actually, the digits are 29524, so the positions are:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15 +1=16, write 6, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8\n- Hundred-thousands place: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n- Millions place: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n- Ten-millions place: 4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carry 1\n- Since there's a carryover, write 1 at the beginning.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just multiply step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, no carryover\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, no carryover\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n\n4*3=12 +1=13 \u21923, carryover 1\n\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after 4*3, we have 2, then 2*3=6+1=7, then 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Then 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Then 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. Then, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would go to the next digit, but since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, the next digit is 2, but actually, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 30000*3=90000, and 29524 is slightly less than 30000, so 88572 is 90000 - 1428, which seems plausible. Alternatively, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" instances:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nEach time we have a new layer. So from the innermost, we have 9 layers because each time we add another \"1+3\". So, yes, Layer1 to Layer9, each time adding a layer. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B\n\na_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n=1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n=1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B +1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B +1\n\nThen, -2B =1 => B= -1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 =4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method, like finding a closed-form formula, to ensure that the result is accurate. So, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's write it out:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  -------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nNow, since there are no more digits, we have the carryover 2 from the previous step?

So, the digits are:\n\n- Units place: 4\n- Tens place: 2\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 9\n- Ten-thousands place: 2\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476*3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of each layer is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We know that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

So, the final answer is 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. This seems similar to a geometric series or something, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me recall the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me see if I can compute it another way or if there's a pattern I missed. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, the recurrence approach seems appropriate. Another way to think about it is that each layer is like 3^{n} -1 divided by 2, as we saw earlier. So, with n=9 layers, the innermost being layer 1, the outermost being layer 9, which gives us 3^{10}-1 over 2, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine the final value is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Each layer is calculated as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. The recurrence relation for each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n4. Solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n5. For the outermost layer (n=9), compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if it's a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a recurrence relation as I solved earlier. So, I think the step-by-step approach is solid, and the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using a closed-form formula. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier calculations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula confirms our step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Evaluating the innermost layer and progressing outward, we find the value of the outermost expression. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me use another method: 29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, checking each computation and even deriving a formula to confirm the result. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now, so I think I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing from the top: 88572. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the multiplication steps either. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until the outermost layer is computed as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to ensure each layer is correct. Let's recast the layers with more precise calculations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 0*3=0. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 6 8 2 7 5 2 4? Wait, maybe I should write it digit by digit. Let's do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Millions place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n- Ten-millions place: 0 * 3 = 0 + 2 = 2 \u2192 write 2, carryover 0.\n- Hundred-millions place: 0 * 3 = 0 \u2192 write 0, carryover 0.\n- Billions place: 2 * 3 = 6 \u2192 write 6.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it as 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7. Wait, that's not right. Wait, let me list the digits:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 8\n- Ten-thousands place: 7\n- Hundred-thousands place: 7\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplied by 3, we should have:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing it out from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would make the number 88572. Let me check that: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Yes, because 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way as a check. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n goes from 1 to 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But regardless, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward here, especially since it's only 9 layers. Let me just double-check my arithmetic for each layer once more to be absolutely sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count them: The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 1. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. So yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(previous layer). So my computation seems correct.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see if that formula holds for the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. Let me solve this recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r=3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A=-1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 holds. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is a_1=4, and each layer out adds one more. So the outermost layer, which is the 9th, would be a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So that's correct. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I computed before. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Solving this recurrence, we find a formula for the nth layer: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"
