So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the steps. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1 +3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, then solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series, and here we have a finite number of terms, so maybe it's different. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented as x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x_1=4. Then, each subsequent x is 1 + 3 times the previous x. So, x_1=4, x_2=13, x_3=40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, in this case, since there are 9 layers, x_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then the entire expression is 3*x_9. So, I think my approach was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next digit: 5*3=15 +2=17, so 7, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 9*3=27, so 7, carryover 2. Next digit: 0*3=0 +2=2. Next digit: 2*3=6. So, writing it out from right to left: 2, 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 6? Wait, that can't be right because the number is only 5 digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when multiplying by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me compute it correctly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8 (from the 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check with actual multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong. So, let me recast each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = -1 => -2C = -1 => C = 1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 1/2 => 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => A = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had a_2=13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my approach was wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1=4.\n\nn=2: a_2=1+3*4=13.\n\nn=3: a_3=1+3*13=40.\n\nn=4: a_4=1+3*40=121.\n\nn=5: a_5=1+3*121=364.\n\nn=6: a_6=1+3*364=1093.\n\nn=7: a_7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nn=8: a_8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nn=9: a_9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, using the formula a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2, when n=2: (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = 66/6 =11, which is not 13. So, the formula is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard method is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to a final value of 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, each term is defined by the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but perhaps it's easier to recognize the pattern. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for a_n? Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the formula approach both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the innermost layer (n=1) to the outermost (n=9), the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem, especially since there are only nine layers. However, for future reference, the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} can be solved. Let's see: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^(p) = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the answer without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, either method works, but using the formula is quicker and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The problem is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. So, that's another way to express it.\n\nBut in any case, the numerical answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the original expression, it's a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so when you expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which can be expressed as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the expression is nested, not a sum. Wait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me see.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote the innermost part as S, so S = 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). But perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Each time you have 1 + 3*(something), and that something is the next layer. So, when you expand it all the way, you get 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If you expand all the parentheses, how many terms would you get? Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply it by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did the multiplication step by step, I might have messed up the places. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3(...) is a layer. So starting from the innermost: (1+3) is layer 1, then (1+3(...)) is layer 2, up to the outermost, which is layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct with 9 layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could express the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 (correct).

But maybe I should check with a different method, like using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms using the formula to see if it matches. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but that's not correct because a_1 is 4. Hmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that confirms that a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds on the previous one, and each time I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Alternatively, I could think of this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the arithmetic, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, looking at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). That's a recursive formula. So, it's a geometric sequence or something similar? Let me see. Let's denote L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let me see what the general formula for L(n) would be. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer, which makes me more confident that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series multiplied by 3 each time, but I think the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both confirm that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a couple of layers again to ensure consistency. Let's take Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Using a recursive approach and verifying with a formula, the final result is calculated as follows:\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using the formula for a geometric series. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\).

I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, that seems off. Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So, 2*10,000 + 9*1,000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1. So, 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit multiplied by 3 and handle the carries. Starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be just under 90,000. Wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second, when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscalculated 3*9,841. Let me check that again. 9,841 * 3: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 800 * 3 = 2,400; 40 * 3 = 120; 1 * 3 = 3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: As above, that's 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it step by step helps prevent mistakes. I was a bit worried when I first saw all those threes and ones, but breaking it down made it manageable. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the next term, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations:\n\n3A + B = 4\n\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same answer without computing each layer manually. That's much faster, especially if there were more layers. It's good to recognize such patterns.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The structure of the expression is such that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it, directly using exponents. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm absolutely certain that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, which might give a more straightforward formula. Let me see if that approach works. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula: a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, but in our case, k is 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula still applies. Let me try that. Here, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k = 3, c = 1. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Plugging in the values: a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify the denominators: 1 - 3 = -2. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(-2)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(-2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Which simplifies to (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's see if this formula works for n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1: (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 should be 13. Plugging n=2: (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 should be 40. Plugging n=3: (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561*9: 6000*9=54,000, 500*9=4,500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500; 58,500 + 540 = 59,040; 59,040 +9=59,049. So, 9*6561=59,049. Then, (9/2)*6561=59,049/2=29,524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29,524.5 - 0.5 =29,524. So, a_9=29,524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Alternatively, since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, the final result is 3*a_9=3*(29,524)=88,572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula approach, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost term is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3n where n is the previous layer. This seems like a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >=2, with L1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case.\n\nThe general solution is Ln = C*a^n + (b/(1 - a)) when a \u22601.\n\nWait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the equation:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K =1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(L9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence, which gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations when I was computing each layer step by step. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 expansion, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the linear recurrence give the same result, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because that seems like a big number. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing very quickly. Let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the first 3, then each 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of closing parentheses: Starting from the end, each set adds one more. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.

Let me define a function a_n where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is a_1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try expanding it a bit to see the pattern. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand it step by step: Starting from the innermost: Let me define each layer as before, but perhaps I can see a pattern in the coefficients. Alternatively, maybe I can write E in terms of itself, but since it's finite, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. But since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the sum might be a geometric series. However, since each term is added and then multiplied by 3, it's a bit different. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the final layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000=88048, +500=88548, +24=88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any intermediate steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute the nth term without having to compute each layer step by step. That might be a good way to verify my answer.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be solved using the formula:\n\na_n = c*r^{n} / (r - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1}\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3P \u2192 P - 3P = 1 \u2192 -2P = 1 \u2192 P = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nWait, but let me check: Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, so a_1 = 4, which should equal (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI notice that each L_n can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, it works for the first few layers. So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me confirm 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again using the formula.\n\n29524 * 3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the closed-form formula for the entire expression.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, each layer can be computed step by step. The innermost expression is evaluated first, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. The final computation yields the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3 after computing the innermost parentheses. So, yes, my approach was correct. Each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost, and then moving outward. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this more efficiently, especially since each layer is similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, but actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term. Alternatively, since it's a first-order linear recurrence, I can solve it using iteration. Let's try expanding the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is growing exponentially. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms in terms of a_1: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(4) = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(13) = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(40) = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*(121) = 364 Hmm, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive approach, or apply the formula, I get 88572 as the final result. I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the final result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Comparing this to the general form L_n = A*3^{n} + B, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outwards. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula confirms the result. The final computation is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 0 now. So the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about whether this expression forms a geometric series or something similar. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(next layer). Let's denote each layer as a_i, where i ranges from 1 to 9. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A\u00d73^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A\u00d73^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A\u00d73^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3\u00d7a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d7(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's add them up: 29524 +29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 +29524: Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, then +9524=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might have an off-by-one error. Let me count the number of layers again.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a_1=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, since a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, which is 3^4 + something? Wait, 3^4 is 81, but a4 is 121, which is 81 +40. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see, but maybe it's easier to solve it as a linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant solution a_n = K. Substituting into the equation: K =1 +3*K => K =1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3C -1/2 =>3C=4 +1/2=9/2 =>C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. I think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure, I took it step by step. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By calculating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Define Layers:** Label each nested term from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Apply the Formula:** Recognizing the pattern, each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For Layer 9, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Compute the Final Expression:** Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more to be sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the layers go from a_1 to a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P =1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct. I think I've thought this through thoroughly, checking each step and even deriving a formula to confirm the result. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we reach the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (Correct) So, it seems like each step checks out. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4, so plugging in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me plug in the general form into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug back into the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that L1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the formula: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=0, if we consider L0, it would be 1 (since L1 = 1 + 3*L0, so 4 = 1 + 3*L0 => L0 = 1). So, plugging n=0 into the formula: L0 = A*3^0 + B = A + B = 1. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and A + B = 1. Subtracting the second equation from the first: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, substituting A into the second equation: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).
