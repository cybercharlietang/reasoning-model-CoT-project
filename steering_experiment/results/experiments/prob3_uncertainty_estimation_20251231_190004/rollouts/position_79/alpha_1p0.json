Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^(p) = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that's correct. I think my initial step-by-step computation was accurate. I just wanted to confirm using the recurrence relation method to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. It's easy to get lost in so many layers, so double-checking with a formula is a good idea. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the layers go up to a_9. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context because all our layers are positive. Maybe that approach isn't helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of a_1. Let's see: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\na_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=121.\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=364.\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3*364=1093.\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, the same as before. So, the formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: For n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, yes, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms it as well. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing a pattern, the expression can be represented by a recurrence relation, leading to a general formula. Applying this formula confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, in general, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, etc. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer manually. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, set this equal to the left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is indeed 88572. I think I did that correctly. Let me just check if I applied the formula correctly. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, n=1, gives a_1=4, which is correct. Then, each subsequent layer increments n by 1. So, layer 9 would be n=9, giving a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1's. But since I've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using this method, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4.

So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can solve it as a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3r, which gives r=0, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4, which is 3^1 + 1? No, 3^1 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4. a_2 = 13, which is 3^2 + 4? 3^2=9, 9 + 4=13. a_3 = 40, which is 3^3 + 13=27 +13=40. a_4=121=3^4 +40=81 +40=121. Hmm, so it seems that a_n = 3^n + a_{n-1}, but wait, that's not exactly the case. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation properly. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So c=3, d=1. The solution is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1=4. So let me adjust the indices. Let me define n starting at 1. So for n=1, a_1=4. Then for n=2, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*4=13. So using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But since our initial condition is a_1=4, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me think. Alternatively, let's write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result I got before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I did everything correctly, but just to make sure, let me check the formula again. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding each layer step by step, but that would take a lot of time, and since I've already verified it with both step-by-step computation and the formula, I think it's safe. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me try to compute it another way to confirm. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without expanding each layer, especially since it's a repeating pattern. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, but that might not directly help unless I can express it as a sum. Alternatively, since the expression is built up by multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I have a series like S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, then S = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, which is similar to what we found earlier. In our case, each layer adds another power of 3, so after 9 layers, we have up to 3^9. Wait, but in our formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what we found. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Specifically, since each term is a linear function of the previous term, we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the final answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the closed-form solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The general form is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's compute a_4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which is correct as per earlier calculations.

    "text": " Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840 +0=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or finding the general formula for the layers, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the formula checks out with the initial layers, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), but wait, actually, let me think again. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b. In this case, k=3, b=1. The solution is a_n = k^n*a_0 + b*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is after one step. So maybe the initial term is a_0 = 1, and then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, if we consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, the general solution for a_n where n >= 0 is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula. For n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. Correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have a_9, which is the 9th layer, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the geometric series. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Let me recall that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n. But in this case, it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this pattern, we determine the value of the innermost layer and propagate outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Suppose a_n = D for all n. Then, substituting into the equation: D = 1 + 3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4= C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.

Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but let me just check once more to be sure. Maybe I can compute the expression step by step without using the formula. Let's try computing each layer again: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can expand this recursively: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, after n steps, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but a_0 would be 1, right? Because when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, and a_0 is 1. So, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*a_0. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, more accurately, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. I think I did everything correctly, but let me double-check the formula. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

That seems right. Hmm, but let me try another approach just to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it aligns. For example, a_4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. a_5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, I think my earlier computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of this formula. Since the outermost layer is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, the expression is (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but let me just check my calculations again to be thorough. Computing each layer step by step: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Both methods confirm the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for L_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we can compute L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer without having to calculate each step manually, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since I only had nine layers, the step-by-step approach wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case it's needed for a more complex problem. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence relation approach is solid here. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The final computation results in the value:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for L_n, which might make it easier for larger n or for verification. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we can compute it as L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute 3*29524 step by step. Let me break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4. Compute each term: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 digit by digit: 29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nNext digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct. Therefore, I think I've solved it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, that's a quicker way to compute it without going through each layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: L1 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nHmm, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, that's exactly the recurrence relation. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). Wait, but in our case, a=3, so K = 1/(1-3) = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because our terms are positive and increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.\n\nThe standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K, we have:\n\nK = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(1 - a).\n\nIn our case, a=3, b=1, so L_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, L1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, plugging n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1, L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3, L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9.\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier. 29524 * 3: Let me compute it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also works.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check each step again for any possible miscalculations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully. Let me list them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but actually, L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, in general, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, for n layers, the value would be L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, but earlier I labeled the innermost as Layer 1, so the outermost would be Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula, let me test it with n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, as computed earlier. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute the value for any number of layers without having to compute each step. But in this problem, since there are 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. If I expand it fully, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on. If I expand all the layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this out as a sum. Each time, we have a term that's 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is nested inside the previous one. However, since we've already derived a formula using the recurrence relation, and confirmed that it works, I think that's sufficient. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct. Therefore, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula using the recurrence relation also confirms the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of which is 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I remember that for such linear recurrence relations, there's a formula to find the nth term without computing each one step by step. The formula for a_n is ( (3^{n} - 1) / (3 - 1) ) + something. Wait, let me recall. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, which for a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1 is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, the innermost being a_1, and the outermost being a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So that matches the previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step, especially for a larger number of layers. So, the key was recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it using the method for linear recurrences. That way, I can find a direct formula without computing each term individually. This also helps in verifying that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and define each layer recursively.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. So, is there a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation? Let's think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1= A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4. So, 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was Layer 1: a_1=4, and we had 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, the value of the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is a_9, so the value inside the big parentheses is a_9, and then multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since the problem is given with 9 layers, I think my initial step-by-step approach was correct, and the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...\" introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3\" before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, maybe a better way is to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, but the innermost is just 1 + 3, not 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. Because each time you have a \"1 + 3(\" except the last one, which is just \"1 + 3\". So, from the start, the first 3(1 + 3(...) starts layer 1, then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...) starts layer 2, and so on until layer 9, which is just 1 + 3. So yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers leading to a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572 is correct. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on. Wait, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1. Solving for A: A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, L_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. Let me compute 3^10 step by step. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct, so 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by the previous term plus 1. So, the expression is a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me think about that. If I have L_n=1 + 3*L_{n-1}, then expanding this recursively, it becomes L_n=1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, each layer adds another 1 and another multiplication by 3. So, for Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))) with nine 1s and nine 3s. Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more 1 and one more 3. So, for Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). So, the total number of 1s is 9, and the total number of 3s is 9. So, expanding this, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1. Wait, is that correct? Let me see. When you expand 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), each time you distribute the 3, you get 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. So, the expanded form would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k. Because each term is 3^k, where k starts at 0. So, the sum S= sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, n=9 terms (from k=0 to 8). So, S= (3^9 -1)/(3 -1)= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Wait, but that's Layer 9 according to my earlier computation, but wait, no, earlier Layer 9 was 29524, which is 3 times 9841. Wait, no, actually, in my initial approach, Layer 9 was (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, but now, if I expand it, I get sum_{k=0}^8 3^k=9841, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Hmm, so that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check. If Layer 9 is the outermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), and so on, down to Layer 1=1+3=4. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, using the formula I derived earlier, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. But when I expand the expression, I get sum_{k=0}^8 3^k=9841, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. So, that's different. Wait, that suggests that perhaps I have a misalignment in the layers. Because if I expand the expression, it's 9 terms, from 3^0 up to 3^8, which is 9 terms, corresponding to n=9. So, maybe my initial formula was off by one. Let me check the formula again. I had L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. But when n=9, that gives (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, but when expanding, it's (3^9 -1)/2=9841. So, that suggests that perhaps the formula is L_n=(3^{n} -1)/2, not 3^{n+1}. Let me check that. If L_n=(3^{n} -1)/2, then for n=1, L_1=(3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but earlier, L_1=4. That's not correct. Wait, so perhaps the formula is L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, but when expanding, the sum is up to 3^{n-1}. Let me clarify. Let me consider that each Layer n corresponds to a sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k. So, for Layer 1, n=1, sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k=1, but Layer 1 is 1+3=4, which is 1 + 3^1=4. So, perhaps Layer n corresponds to sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, no, because for Layer 1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k=1+3=4, which matches. Layer 2 would be sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k=1+3+9=13, which matches Layer 2. Layer 3: 1+3+9+27=40, which matches. So, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. So, the sum S= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, Layer n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct. But when I expanded the expression earlier, I thought it was sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k=9841, but that's incorrect because the number of terms is 9, which would be sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k= (3^9 -1)/2=9841, which is Layer 8. Wait, that makes sense. So, each Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 1: sum from 0 to1=4, Layer 2: sum from 0 to2=13, ..., Layer 9: sum from 0 to9 of 3^k=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, my initial computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the formula checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, L3,..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. I can see that each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. Let me think about it. The recursion is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. Given that Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, let's assume the solution is Ln = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous +1. But the formula I found is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, just to see if it aligns. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try expanding it step by step, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k for some k. Let me think about it. Let me denote the innermost term as 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*something. So, the entire expression can be thought of as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. Let me try to formalize that.\n\nStarting from the innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying the previous result by 3.\n\nSo, if I think of the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nSo, expanding this, it's like 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire expression as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to an increasing power. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nThere are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), so E = 3*(L9), where L9 is the ninth layer.\n\nBut from earlier, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model E as a sum:\n\nE = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I expand E, starting from the innermost parentheses, each 1 contributes to the total multiplied by 3^k where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nSo, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9, the next one by 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1 which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nBut wait, let me see: when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, the 1 is multiplied by 3, and the inner expression is multiplied by 3 as well. So, perhaps the total sum is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nSo, if I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 1s. Each layer adds another 1. Since there are nine layers, there are nine 1s.\n\nSo, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))).\n\nWait, but when I expand it, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k where k is from 0 to 8, because the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, since there are nine layers, so the exponents go from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try expanding it step by step.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1s. Each time I have a 1, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine 1s.\n\nSo, the expansion would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, if I model E as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of times it's been multiplied by 3, then since there are nine layers, the exponents go from 0 to 8. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k).\n\nWait, no, because each 1 is multiplied by 3^(number of layers above it). Wait, let me see.\n\nActually, each 1 is at a certain depth, so the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1 which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the parentheses would be sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, n=9 terms.\n\nSum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that's the sum inside the parentheses, which is Layer 9, which we computed as 29524 earlier. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, because Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the sum inside the parentheses is 9841, which is Layer 8? Wait, no, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, which is equal to (3^9 -1)/2. Because 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841.\n\nYes, so the sum inside the parentheses is 9841, which is Layer 8? Wait, no, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, that's 9841, which is Layer 8. Wait, no, because Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to 7 of 3^k). Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nEach Layer n is defined as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nAs we saw earlier, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4.\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k), but wait, no, because the layers are nested.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better not to overcomplicate it. I think my initial step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nYes, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants. Let me solve for C and D. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. But a_n is also equal to C*3^n + D. Therefore, C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let's check: the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2: a_2 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with that now. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the recursive approach confirms the result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, each layer is a_n. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. Wait, but in this case, the problem has 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost part, and then we multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: a_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2=4. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check that with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

But just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and there are 9 layers, starting from 1+3, then each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the innermost is 1+3=4. Then, each step out is 1 +3*(previous). So, perhaps writing a table would help:\n\nLayer | Value\n1 | 4\n2 | 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3 | 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4 | 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5 | 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6 | 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7 | 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8 | 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9 | 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right, but let me double-check the exponent in the formula. Wait, the formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=29524, and 3 times that is 88572.

It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, more accurately, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me set it up properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, to solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 =4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the way geometric series work. So, the expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(a geometric series with ratio 3). But since each term is nested, it's more of a geometric progression in the exponents. But I think the formula I derived earlier is more straightforward. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the 9th layer being 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive formula where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence relation is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient (here, r=3) and c is the constant term (here, c=1). The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that seems correct.
