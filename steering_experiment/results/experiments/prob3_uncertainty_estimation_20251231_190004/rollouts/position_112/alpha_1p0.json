So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Let me solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but in our computations, all layers are integers. Maybe the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution would work better. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern by computing the first few terms and seeing if a geometric progression is involved. Let's see: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 a_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 a_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 a_4 = 121 = 3*40 + 1 ... So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. The formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n} + c/(r-1), where c is the constant term in the recurrence (which is 1 here), and r is the ratio (3 here). Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. Actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. The solution is a_n = r^{n}*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, if we consider n starting at 1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. To use the standard formula, perhaps we need to adjust the indices. Let me set m = n - 1, so that when n=1, m=0, and a_1 = 3*a_0 + 1. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 is 1. Let me see: If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 3*a_0 + 1 = 3*1 + 1 = 4, which matches. Then, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13, etc. So, using the formula for a_n where n starts at 0: a_n = r^{n}*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, c=1, a_0=1. So, a_n = 3^{n}*1 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n layers, starting from a_0=1, the value after n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1 in the formula. Wait, let me clarify. If a_0=1, then a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. So, the outermost layer in our problem is a_9, which would be computed as a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572, which is the same as before.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. But since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. I think the step-by-step computation is more intuitive for someone just starting out, while the formula is more efficient once you recognize the pattern. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers, so we compute from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"
