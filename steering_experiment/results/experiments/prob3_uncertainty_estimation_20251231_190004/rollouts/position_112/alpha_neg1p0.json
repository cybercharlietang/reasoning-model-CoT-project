Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's check: The innermost is Layer 1: a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2: a_2 = 13, Layer 3: 40, and so on up to Layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value of the innermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, using the closed-form formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. 3. After computing up to Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.
