Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.

So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.

Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at 88572 as the final result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3.

    "text": " 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the method I did seems to give the correct result. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: The final expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods converge to the same number, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
