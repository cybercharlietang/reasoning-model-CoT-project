Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, after n steps, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n}*a_0. Wait, but a_0 would be 1, since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = (a_1 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*a_0. But since a_0 =1, this becomes a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}. The sum is a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = (3^{n+1} -1 + 2*3^{n+1}) /2 = (3*3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check. Wait, starting from a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*a_0. Since a_0 =1, it's sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}. The sum is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = (3^{n+1} -1 + 2*3^{n+1})/2 = (3*3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. But earlier, I had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, which one is correct? Let me test for n=1. When n=1, a_1 =4. Using the first formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. Using the second formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =13, which is incorrect because a_1 is 4. So, the first formula is correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, as before. So, the closed-form confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 manually. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our initial terms are integers. Let me check my approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Then, K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as defined. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me check if my closed-form formula is correct by testing it with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer was a_1=4, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2 is a_2=13, etc., up to Layer 9 being a_9=29524.
