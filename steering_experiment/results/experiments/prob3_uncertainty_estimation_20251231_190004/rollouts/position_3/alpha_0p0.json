    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me try to figure out where to start. It seems like each part is a similar structure: 3 times (1 plus something). Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression and see how many layers there are. I'll count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Because that's the first one after the last parenthesis.\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3(...) structure.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 parts. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time inside another set of parentheses. Let's see:\n\n- Starting from the innermost: 1+3\n- Then, each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count each opening parenthesis:\n\n1. The innermost is after the first 1+3: that's one layer.\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nWait, maybe I can count how many times 3( appears. Let me see:\n\n- The entire expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is nested inside. Let me count the number of 3(.\n\n1. The first 3( is at the outermost level.\n2. Then, inside it, there's another 3(, so that's two.\n3. Continuing, each time I see a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to count how many layers there are by looking at the number of 1+3( parts. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that each layer adds another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I think there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me check: the innermost is 1+3, then each time another 1+3 wraps around it. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the expression: starting from the innermost, each time I go outward, I have another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. So, I think there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( adds another (, so let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, so that would make 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1: 1+3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of each layer as being 1 + 3*(inner expression). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each step:\n\n1. L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing L9, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me confirm that structure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's L1 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 is 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 is 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the initial expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 3*3=9, write down 9.\n\nWait, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, because I might have made a mistake in computing L9.\n\nWait, let me go back and verify each layer step by step, because 3*29524 seems very large, and perhaps I made an error in one of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer from L1 to L9.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carryover 1.\n\nBut since there's no more digits, we write down 1.\n\nSo, 364*3=1092. Therefore, L6=1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\n1093 *3:\n\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n0*3=0 +2=2, write down 2.\n\n1*3=3, write down 3.\n\nSo, 3*1093=3279.\n\nThus, L7=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3280*3:\n\n0*3=0.\n\n8*3=24, write down 4, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n3*3=9.\n\nSo, 3280*3=9840.\n\nThus, L8=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3.\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nSince there's a carryover 2 with no more digits, we write down 2.\n\nWait, but 9841*3: Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 9841 is a 4-digit number: thousands digit 9, hundreds digit 8, tens digit 4, units digit 1.\n\nSo, 1*3=3.\n\n4*3=12: write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25: write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29: write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523.\n\nThus, L9=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n\nWait, but that would give us 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524*3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nFinally, 3 (the digit in the ten-thousands place) is 2, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nWait, so when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, because 29524*3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because the number seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me confirm how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, as I thought earlier. So, 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, each layer is computed correctly, leading up to L9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost is 3*(L9). So, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nLet me compute each a_n step by step:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D. Then, D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4.\n\na1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nLet me see: from the innermost to the outermost, each time we have a 1+3(.... So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each layer adds one more 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nThus, a9 is the value at the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, yes, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the pattern more clearly. Each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula checks out with each step. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\". I think there are nine instances of \"1+3\" inside each other, each multiplied by 3. So, it's like a recursive expression where each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nMaybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. The expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, let's denote each layer as a term.\n\nLet me define each layer step by step:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers from the inside out. So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, and each inner layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I should index the layers starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_2, up to a_9, with each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n________\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I did that wrong.\n\nWait, 29,524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to compute each step manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it generally, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of layers from the inside out. Each layer is given by the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost expression is $1+3$. Let me compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another $1 + 3( ... )$. Wait, but in this case, the innermost was just $1+3$, so the next one out is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer:\n   $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Because the next layer is $1 + 3(1+3(...))$.

The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo let me list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump.

Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9.\n\nSo a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. So I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's write this down step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me count the number of times this pattern repeats. Let me see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3.\n2. Then, moving one level out, it's 1 + 3 times that result.\n3. Then another level out, again 1 + 3 times the previous result.\n4. This pattern continues until we get to the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3.\n- Then each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we have 9 layers?

So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, to compute this, I should start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each step again:\n\nCompute L1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCompute L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nSo, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B\n\nAnd for n >= 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting the general solution into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, this method also confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each layer as follows:\n\nEach time, you have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nMultiplying the last term by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and a constant addition of 1 each time.\n\nBut regardless of the method, whether computing step by step or solving the recurrence relation, the result comes out to be 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, starting from the innermost part and working my way out, that should be the way to go. Maybe I can solve each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write it out with parentheses to see the structure better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, the layer above that is 1 + 12. Let me calculate that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 3 times 13. So, 3*13.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 39.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nMoving out, it's 3*40.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 40 = 120\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 120.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nMoving out, it's 3*121.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 121 = 363\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 363.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nMoving out, it's 3*364.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 364 = 1092\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 1092.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nMoving out, it's 3*1093.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3279.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMoving out, it's 3*3280.\n\nNext layer:\n3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 9840.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check how many layers there are because I might have miscounted. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, I think I should have 9 layers to compute. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, that's 15 steps, but I think I miscounted because the original problem has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me visualize the structure again.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3 except the outermost one. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a term, and each is nested within the previous one. So, the number of such terms is 9, which would mean 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each multiplied by 3 except the outermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, each of these terms is inside another 3(...). So, perhaps each layer adds another multiplication by 3 after adding 1. Let me try to think of it as a recursive structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a series of operations where each step is 1 + 3*previous_result, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, no, the structure is a bit different. Let me try to write down each step clearly, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number the layers from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572, but let me check each step carefully because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, we have (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it as a sequence of operations.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one.\n\nLet me start with the innermost:\n\nLet me call the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer is a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because when I first did it, I thought the answer might be 88572, but I want to make sure.\n\nWait, let's check a1 through a9 again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check a8 again: 3*3280.\n\n3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841, which is a8.\n\nThen a9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur? Let's count the opening parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would mean 9 layers inside, each adding 1 + 3*(...), then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the calculation I did earlier with a1 to a9 is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nWe can solve for A and B using the initial condition.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nAlso, the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the recurrence iteratively.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's similar to 3^n + (something).\n\nWait, let me compute L_n:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2A\n\n=> A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nEach time we have a term that's 3^k, but maybe that's complicating it more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is built upon the previous, and each is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified with the formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute each step once more:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) =4.\n\nThen, 3*4=12, then 1 +12=13.\n\n3*13=39, then 1 +39=40.\n\n3*40=120, 1 +120=121.\n\n3*121=363, 1 +363=364.\n\n3*364=1092, 1 +1092=1093.\n\n3*1093=3279, 1 +3279=3280.\n\n3*3280=9840, 1 +9840=9841.\n\n3*9841=29523, 1 +29523=29524.\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've double-checked each step, and the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding what this expression is. It seems like a nested expression where each level has a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each level adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of 3s. Hmm, each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by it. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of above)\n4. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is building upon the previous one. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, since there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next is (1 + 3*(...)), which would be Layer 2\n3. Then Layer 3, and so on, until the outermost Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let me see how many times 3 is multiplied. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, each step is a new layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start with the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost 3*(result of Layer 9) would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1: 4\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) \u2192 Layer 2: 13\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) \u2192 Layer 3: 40\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) \u2192 Layer 4: 121\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) \u2192 Layer 5: 364\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) \u2192 Layer 6: 1093\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) \u2192 Layer 7: 3280\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) \u2192 Layer 8: 9841\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) \u2192 Layer 9: 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nThen 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and doing that nine times. So, it's like a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2.\n\n243*243: Let's compute that.\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n\n243 * 3 = 729\n\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, yes, 3^10=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524*3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous result. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part is a similar expression, just repeated multiple times. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. The next part after the innermost (1+3) is 3 times that, right? So it's 3*(1+3). But wait, no, looking again, it's 3 times the result of (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe I need to handle each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try writing this out more clearly. Let me denote each layer as a step, starting from the innermost. So, let's number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 through 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let me count: starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one. So, perhaps I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me check again. Wait, actually, in the problem, each layer is inside another 3*(1 + ...). So maybe each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try to think of it that way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each step as computing the value inside the parentheses first, then multiplying by 3, and then using that result in the next outer parentheses. So, let me try to compute each step methodically.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3).

The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., up to L9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nStarting from L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems more consistent. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Hmm, that might be different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27; so 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84; so 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, like expanding the expression algebraically or looking for a pattern.\n\nLet me see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nThis seems like a recursive expression where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, but that's different from before. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each a_n is the value inside the nth parentheses. Let me try to define it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows: the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so perhaps the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after nine layers.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. Let me try to model it that way.\n\nSo, if I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, so now I'm confused because using this approach, I get a different result.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me check both approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 3*(1+4)=15, then 3*(1+15)=48, and so on up to nine layers, resulting in 36084.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but these two results are different, so one of the approaches must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in how I'm interpreting the layers. Let me try to parse the original expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, in this approach, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result), and after nine layers, the result is 36084.\n\nBut in the other approach, where I defined a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, I ended up with a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But that seems inconsistent with the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial a_1 is inside the 3*() or not.\n\nWait, in the first approach, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, then 3*(1 +4)=15, then 3*(1 +15)=48, etc., up to nine layers, giving 36084.\n\nIn the second approach, I treated a_1 as (1 +3)=4, then a_2=1 +3*a_1=13, a_3=1 +3*a_2=40, etc., up to a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut the problem is that in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so each a_n is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the second approach. Let me redefine it correctly.\n\nLet me define each a_n as 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 being the innermost (1 + 3)=4.\n\nWait, but then a_1 would be 4, a_2=3*(1 +4)=15, a_3=3*(1 +15)=48, and so on, which is the same as the first approach. Then, after nine layers, a_9=36084, which matches the first approach.\n\nSo, perhaps in the second approach, I incorrectly defined a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1} instead of 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nYes, that's the mistake. So, in the correct approach, each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, let's recast that:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 +4)=15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2)=3*(1 +15)=48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 +48)=147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 +147)=444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 +444)=1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 +1335)=4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 +4008)=12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 +12027)=36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with the first approach, giving the final result as 36084.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression again step by step, without using a_n notation, just directly computing each layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think 36,084 is the correct answer.\n\nI was confused earlier because I misapplied the recursive formula in the second approach, but now I see that both approaches lead to the same result when done correctly.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the result is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3 for the next layer. After systematically computing each layer, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4) = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 15) = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 48) = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 147) = 3 \u00d7 148 = 444.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 444) = 3 \u00d7 445 = 1335.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1335) = 3 \u00d7 1336 = 4008.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4008) = 3 \u00d7 4009 = 12027.\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   - Compute 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12027) = 3 \u00d7 12028 = 36084.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"

I think I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to write down the expression step by step, starting from the inside. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1+3) is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm following the structure correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. So, maybe I should work from the inside out, each time substituting the inner result into the next outer expression.\n\nLet me try to outline each level. Let's number them from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, that's the 9th level: (1 + 3). Then each previous level adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me list each level:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me do this step by step. 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 29,524 *3=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13\n\nLevel3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Level8 again: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct.\n\nLevel9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n=?\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first looked at the problem, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that's 1 plus 3 times another sum, and so on. So, perhaps each time, it's a geometric series? Wait, maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nWait, let me think. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote each level as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, a_3=40, etc. It seems like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, no, more precisely, each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1=4,\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13,\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40,\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121,\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364,\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093,\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280,\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841,\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nWait, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th level, n=9:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 *3\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n=60,000 +27,000 +1,500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each level step by step, and then verifying using a formula for the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

It seems like there are nine layers here because I count nine opening parentheses. Let me verify that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, each layer is 3*(1 + something), and that something is another similar expression. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think there are nine layers here.\n\nHmm, maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + ...). The ... here is the result of the innermost expression, which is 4. So, let's compute that: 3*(1 + 4). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 1 + 4 is 5. Then, 3*5 is 15. So, the second layer from the inside is 15.\n\nNext layer out: again, it's 3*(1 + ...). The ... here is the result from the previous layer, which is 15. So, compute 3*(1 + 15). Inside the parentheses: 1 + 15 is 16. Then, 3*16 is 48. So, the third layer is 48.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 3*(1 + 48). Let's compute that: 1 + 48 is 49, then 3*49 is 147. So, fourth layer is 147.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 147). 1 + 147 is 148, then 3*148. Let me compute that: 148*3. 100*3 is 300, 40*3 is 120, 8*3 is 24. So, 300 + 120 is 420, plus 24 is 444. So, fifth layer is 444.\n\nMoving out another layer: 3*(1 + 444). 1 + 444 is 445. Then, 3*445. Let me compute that: 400*3 is 1200, 40*3 is 120, 5*3 is 15. Adding them up: 1200 + 120 is 1320, plus 15 is 1335. Sixth layer is 1335.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 1335). 1 + 1335 is 1336. Then, 3*1336. Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 300*3 is 900, 30*3 is 90, 6*3 is 18. Adding them up: 3000 + 900 is 3900, plus 90 is 3990, plus 18 is 4008. Seventh layer is 4008.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4008). 1 + 4008 is 4009. Then, 3*4009. Let me compute that. 4000*3 is 12,000, 9*3 is 27. So, 12,000 + 27 is 12,027. Eighth layer is 12,027.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12,027). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 1 + 12,027 is 12,028. Then, 3*12,028. Let's calculate that.\n\nBreaking it down: 12,000*3 is 36,000, 28*3 is 84. So, adding them together: 36,000 + 84 is 36,084.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027\n9. 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Each time, I added 1 to the previous result and then multiplied by 3. So, the final result should be 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous term). So, the sequence is defined recursively as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084\n\nYes, so the ninth term is 36,084, which is the result of the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence. It's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write it in standard form:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2K = 3\n\nThus, K = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nThus, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n}) / 6.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor 1/6:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5: (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6: (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7: (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8: (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12,027. Correct.\n\nn=9: (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, the result is the same. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized it's a recursive sequence, derived the general formula, and confirmed it with known values. So, I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move outwards and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{36084}\\)."

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out a pattern or a way to simplify this without getting lost in all those layers. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that's 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. Let's keep going.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 1 + 120 is 121. That's correct.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check that multiplication. 3280 times 3. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Okay, that's correct.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from above). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, it seems consistent each time. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)): starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So let's count the number of 3s multiplied.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So it's a recursive pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So if I denote the innermost as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, since there are nine layers of nesting.\n\nWait, let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth one.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So actually, there are nine instances of (1 + 3*(...)), which would mean that starting from the innermost, we have nine steps. So my earlier calculation of ten steps (from 1 to 10) might be correct because each step corresponds to one layer.\n\nWait, but when I started, the innermost was step 1: (1+3)=4. Then step 2 was the next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. So each step corresponds to a layer. Since there are nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)), plus the outermost 3 multiplied by the result, so total steps would be nine layers inside, each adding one, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9, then the final result is 3*a9.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So let's compute a1 through a9:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of times (1 + 3(...) appears in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are nine instances of (1 + 3*(...)), each nesting one inside the other. So, starting from a1 up to a9, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, nine layers inside, then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula for such a recursive sequence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I think it can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both step by step and using a formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Next Layer:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Starting from the left, each \"1+3\" is inside another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. Let me see, each time it's 3 times (1 + something). Let me write down the structure to visualize it better.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1+3. Then the next layer is 3 times (1 + that result). Then another layer outside that, and so on. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the layers for clarity. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + result of layer 1). Layer 3 is 3*(1 + result of layer 2), and so on until layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, each time there's a \"1+3\", then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the opening parentheses. There are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, so that suggests nine layers. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach it step by step.\n\nLet me start by evaluating the innermost expression first. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is straightforward.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + result from layer 1). So that's 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer out, it's 3*(1 + result from layer 2).

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine sets of parentheses, right? So, each time, we're adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis, except the last one. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" except the last one. So, that suggests there are nine layers, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I have nine layers to compute, each time starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9, getting 36084 as the result. Let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted because each time I'm adding a layer, but perhaps the initial expression is structured differently. Let me try to parse the original expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer wraps another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, let me count the number of times \"1+3\" occurs as a starting point for each layer. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is nine, as I thought before, because each time we have a new opening parenthesis after the initial 3, so nine layers in total.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 3*s. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the operation 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from 1, each time we do 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, but in the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps each layer is a step in the iteration.\n\nSo, if I have nine layers, that would mean I have nine steps, each time computing 3*(1 + previous value). Let me see:\n\nLet me denote each step as a_i, where a_1 is the innermost value.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Each time I compute a_i, I'm moving one layer out. So, starting from a_1 as the innermost, then a_2 is the next layer, and so on up to a_9.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each a_i corresponds to one more layer, so after nine layers, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_i = 3*(1 + a_{i-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_i.\n\nThe recurrence is a_i = 3*(1 + a_{i-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_i = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When i = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2.\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = (11/6)*3^i - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^i = (11/6)*3^i = 11*(3^{i})/6.\n\nSo, a_i = (11*3^i)/6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/6:\n\na_i = (11*3^i - 9)/6.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with i = 1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\ni = 2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\ni = 3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, we need a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9 first:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513.\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000.\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nThis matches the step-by-step calculation I did earlier, so that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify the formula again.\n\nGiven that a_i = (11*3^i - 9)/6.\n\nFor i = 9, 3^9 is 19683, correct.\n\n11*19683 = 216,513, correct.\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504, correct.\n\n216,504 \u00f7 6: Let me compute 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000.\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\n36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 216,504 \u00f7 6 can be computed as:\n\n216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3.\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\n6 into 5 is 0 with 5 remainder, bring down 0: 50.\n\n6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24.\n\n6 into 24 is 4.\n\nSo, 36,084. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something else.\n\nWait, but given the structure of the expression, it's a nested multiplication, so the recurrence relation approach seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer is 3*(1 + previous), so each step is 3*(1 + a_{i-1}), which is a linear function applied repeatedly. So, as we did before, using the recurrence relation is the way to go.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the result is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\nTo verify, we use a recurrence relation approach. The recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[ a_i = 3 \\times (1 + a_{i-1}) \\]\n\nStarting with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we find the general solution:\n\n\\[ a_i = \\frac{11 \\times 3^i - 9}{6} \\]\n\nFor \\(i = 9\\):\n\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{11 \\times 3^9 - 9}{6} = \\frac{11 \\times 19683 - 9}{6} = \\frac{216513 - 9}{6} = \\frac{216504}{6} = 36084 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, it seems like each layer is another 1+3(...). Let me count them: 1+3, then another 1+3 around that, and so on. I think there are nine layers here because each time it's 1+3 multiplied by something, and it's repeated nine times. Wait, actually, let me check again. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, how many times is this happening? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n...\nThis goes on until the outermost layer. So, I think there are nine layers here because each time it's another multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Let me confirm: the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...), so the number of 1+3 terms is nine. So, nine layers. Therefore, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, I can see that each layer adds another set. Let me try to parse it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving out, it's (1+3*(1+3)). Then, moving out another layer, it's (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), and so on, until the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. So, the number of times we have 1+3 multiplied by something is eight times, because the outermost is just multiplied by 3, not another 1+3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nBut wait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and working my way outwards.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na1 = 1 + 3\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\n...\n\nUp to a9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*a9, where a9 is the innermost expression.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nBut wait, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), so the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see: 3*29000=87000, and 3*524=1572, so total is 87000+1572=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is used:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n...\nHow many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the string: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, we have:\n\n- The first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is after each 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, but actually, no, because each 1+3(...) has one opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first layer is (1+3(...)), which is one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so another opening parenthesis.\n\nContinuing this way, how many opening parentheses are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the initial 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9. Because each layer adds another opening parenthesis until the innermost (1+3) which doesn't have another layer.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Let's consider the number of times we have 1+3 multiplied by something. Each time we have 1+3*(something), which is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times I have 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...), so Layer2, Layer3, up to Layer9. So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3*29524 step by step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29000*3=87000\n\n524*3=1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000+1572=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with nine layers of 1+3 multiplied together. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is multiplied by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n10. **Final Result**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to visualize this. \n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. $1 + 3$ is equal to 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(1+3)$. Wait, but I just computed $1+3$ as 4, so that part becomes $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the multiplication: $3 \\times 4 = 12$. Then add 1: $1 + 12 = 13$. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute that. Again, first the multiplication: $3 \\times 13 = 39$. Then add 1: $1 + 39 = 40$. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(40)$. Let me compute that. Multiplying first: $3 \\times 40 = 120$. Then adding 1: $1 + 120 = 121$. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer out: $1 + 3(121)$. Multiplying first: $3 \\times 121 = 363$. Adding 1: $1 + 363 = 364$. So, now we have 364.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is $1 + 3(364)$. Let me calculate that. Multiplication: $3 \\times 364 = 1092$. Then add 1: $1 + 1092 = 1093$. So, that's 1093.\n\nAnother layer out: $1 + 3(1093)$. Let's compute that. Multiplying first: $3 \\times 1093 = 3279$. Adding 1: $1 + 3279 = 3280$. So, now we have 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's calculate that. Multiplying: $3 \\times 3280 = 9840$. Adding 1: $1 + 9840 = 9841$. So, that's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me compute this. First, multiply: $3 \\times 9841 = 29523$. Then add 1: $1 + 29523 = 29524$.

So, that's 88573.\n\nAnother layer out: $1 + 3(88573)$. Let me calculate that. Multiplying: $3 \\times 88573 = 265719$. Adding 1: $1 + 265719 = 265720$.

Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any errors in the earlier layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen: 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nNext: 1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nThen: 1 + 3(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n\nFinally: 3 x 797161 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I didn't see any calculation errors upon review. So, I think the final answer is 2,391,483.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form $1 + 3(n)$, which is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me try to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say:\n\nLet $a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n\nThen $a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\n$a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\n$a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n$a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n$a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n$a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n$a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n$a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\n$a_{10} = 1 + 3a_9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\n$a_{11} = 1 + 3a_{10} = 1 + 265719 = 265720$\n\n$a_{12} = 1 + 3a_{11} = 1 + 797160 = 797161$\n\nThen the final result is $3a_{12} = 3 \\times 797161 = 2,391,483$\n\nSo, by defining each term as $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, starting from $a_1 = 4$, we can see that each term is three times the previous term plus one. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for $a_n$.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is $a_n = k \\cdot a_{n-1} + c$, where in this case, $k=3$ and $c=1$. The solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\n$a_n = k^{n} \\cdot a_0 + \\frac{c(k^{n} - 1)}{k - 1}$\n\nBut wait, in our case, the first term is $a_1 = 4$, so maybe I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the solution can be written as:\n\n$a_n = (a_1 - \\frac{c}{k - 1}) \\cdot k^{n - 1} + \\frac{c}{k - 1}$\n\nPlugging in $a_1 = 4$, $c=1$, and $k=3$:\n\n$a_n = (4 - \\frac{1}{3 - 1}) \\cdot 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{1}{3 - 1}$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$a_n = (4 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$a_n = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, for each $n$, $a_n = \\frac{7 \\cdot 3^{n - 1} + 1}{2}$\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{7 \\cdot 3^{0} + 1}{2} = \\frac{7 + 1}{2} = 4$, which is correct.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n\n$a_2 = \\frac{7 \\cdot 3^{1} + 1}{2} = \\frac{21 + 1}{2} = 11$, but wait, earlier we had $a_2 = 13$. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me rederive it.\n\nGiven the recurrence $a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1$, with $a_1 = 4$.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: $a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r - 3 = 0$, so $r=3$. Thus, the homogeneous solution is $A \\cdot 3^{n}$.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say $a_n = C$. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\n$C = 3C + 1$\n\n$C - 3C = 1$\n\n$-2C = 1$\n\n$C = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = A \\cdot 3^{n} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When $n=1$, $a_1=4$:\n\n$4 = A \\cdot 3^{1} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$4 = 3A - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$3A = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\n$A = \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^{n} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nLet me test this formula with $n=1$:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4$, correct.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n\n$a_2 = \\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13$, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor $n=3$:\n\n$a_3 = \\frac{3^{4} - 1}{2} = \\frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40$, correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each $n$, $a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers of nesting. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. $1 + 3 = 4$ (a1)\n2. $1 + 3(4) = 13$ (a2)\n3. $1 + 3(13) = 40$ (a3)\n4. $1 + 3(40) = 121$ (a4)\n5. $1 + 3(121) = 364$ (a5)\n6. $1 + 3(364) = 1093$ (a6)\n7. $1 + 3(1093) = 3280$ (a7)\n8. $1 + 3(3280) = 9841$ (a8)\n9. $1 + 3(9841) = 29524$ (a9)\n10. $1 + 3(29524) = 88573$ (a10)\n11. $1 + 3(88573) = 265720$ (a11)\n12. $1 + 3(265720) = 797161$ (a12)\n\nSo, the outermost multiplication is 3 times a12, which is 797161. So, using the formula, a12 = (3^{13} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{13}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\n3^12 = 531441\n\n3^13 = 1594323\n\nSo, a12 = (1594323 - 1)/2 = 1594322 / 2 = 797161, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * 797161 = 2391483.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke down the multiplication, I got 2,391,483, which is the same as 2,391,483. So, that seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3 * 797,161 another way.\n\n797,161 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n100 * 3 = 300\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 797,161 is indeed 2,391,483.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Substitute back and compute each subsequent layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3(4) = 13\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(13) = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(40) = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(121) = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(364) = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(88573) = 265720\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3(265720) = 797161\\)\n3. Finally, multiply by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 797161 = 2391483\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{2391483}\\)."

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, let me write it out so I can visualize it better. It's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to be 1 plus 3 times something, and then that result is multiplied by 3 again. So, starting from the innermost part, I should work my way outwards. That makes sense because in math problems with parentheses, you always solve the innermost ones first.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: 1+3(...), then another 1+3(...), and so on. I think there are nine layers of parentheses here. So, the innermost is the first layer, and the outermost is the ninth layer. That seems right.\n\nMaybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me write down each step as I go. So, starting with the innermost part: (1+3). That should be straightforward.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, that 4 is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result from the first layer). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the second layer gives me 13. Now, moving another layer out, the same pattern: 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, third layer would be 1 + 3*13.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. Fourth layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's a jump. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, fifth layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWow, this is increasing rapidly. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLet me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is indeed 3280. Okay, that's correct.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nHmm, 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nAlright, let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nNow, that's the result of the innermost expression up to the ninth layer. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, because 3*29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524*3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading it from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me just go back through each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n3. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n4. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n5. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n6. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n7. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n8. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n9. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me do it again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d73 =6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d73=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nSo, 20000 \u00d73=60000\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n500 \u00d73=1500\n20 \u00d73=60\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n87000 +1500=88500\n88500 +60=88560\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3 \u00d729524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so let's count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...)\n3. (1+3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, I think. Because each time you have a 1+3 multiplied by 3, and then that's inside another 1+3 multiplied by 3, etc., nine times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so the number of opening parentheses is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers, each adding another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, my initial approach was correct, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9.\n\nTherefore, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). So, that's three layers.\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nWait, let me compute it directly:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1+3(1+3*4))=3(1+3*(1+12))=3(1+3*13)=3(1+39)=3*40=120.\n\nYes, that works. So, my approach is correct. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, I get 88572 as the result.\n\nWait, but let me try another small example to be absolutely sure. Let's take two layers: 3(1+3(1+3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 1+3*4=13\n\nThen, 3*13=39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1+3(1+3))=3(1+3*4)=3(1+12)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for two layers, three layers, so it should work for nine layers as well.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, it's like 3 multiplied by a series of expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times another expression. It might help if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me write this out step by step. The innermost part is 1+3. So, starting from there:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression that's 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, that gives me 13. So, now moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, 40. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let's do that.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit big, but okay, let's continue.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1093*3. Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Okay, 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because 29524*3 seems a bit high. Let me do it another way. 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds upon the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and expanding outward. Each time, I took the result from the innermost expression, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and then used that result for the next layer out. Repeating this process nine times (since there are nine sets of parentheses) gets me to the final result.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's ten steps, but the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, the number of layers is nine, which would correspond to nine times I had to compute 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 is the tenth step.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems right. Each of the nine layers adds another 1 + 3*(...), and then the very outermost is multiplied by 3. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nLet me double-check a couple of the steps where I felt like the numbers got big.\n\nFor example, step 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Therefore, I think the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1's and eight 3's in the multiplication. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recursive-like structure.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, since each term is added after being multiplied by 3, it's a bit different. The closed-form approach worked well here because the recurrence relation was linear and non-homogeneous.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form expression using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same final result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\].\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, let me try to parse this. It's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time we have 1 plus 3 times the next expression. Maybe I can work my way outwards, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That sounds like a good plan.\n\nLet me write down the expression with labels to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer until we reach the outermost one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears, it's nine times. Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n10. 3(...)\n\nWait, no. Each time we have a 1 + 3(...), except for the innermost which is just 1 + 3. So maybe there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost is 3 times that result.\n\nLet me try to structure this step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet's denote each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, and then finally the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that multiplication again for S9. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nLet me compute 9841*3 step by step:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So yes, 3*9841 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So S9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by S9.\n\nSo that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524 = Let's see: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572.\n\nSo 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29,524. So 3*29,524.\n\nAlternatively, 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step seems correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). This is a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form solution for S(n). The recurrence is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. Assume S(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is S(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nS(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nS(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works for all the steps. So, S(9) = 29524. Then the outermost layer is 3*S(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each step manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Finally, multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, I think there are nine layers of parentheses. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nYes, that's nine times where each is 1 + 3*(something). So I need to compute from the innermost one outwards.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, until S9.\n\nThen, the final result will be 3*S9.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after computing S9, which is the innermost expression, then moving outward, each step is 1 + 3*previous result, and finally, multiply by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer9). So after computing Layer9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 = 1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, a_1 corresponds to the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBecause n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with what I got earlier. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nBut given that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated nine times, resulting in the value 29,524. Finally, multiplying this value by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the final result by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each layer is a similar structure, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". So, let me write that down:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that part first.\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression.\n\nSo, let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. The innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis adds a layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost expression is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, let me list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. Maybe 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the inner layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let's see. This is a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each part inside the parentheses seems to follow a pattern. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace the innermost (1+3) with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(something). Wait, actually, let me check again. Each time, the structure is 1 + 3*(next part). So, the innermost is (1+3), then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result of innermost), and so on.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly. Maybe I can number them from the innermost to the outermost to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level out: (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Continue this until the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. I can see that starting from the first 3, there are 8 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, that means there are 8 levels of nesting. Let me confirm:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, that's 8 levels. Therefore, I'll need to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost (level 8) and moving outwards to level 1.\n\nLet me list them as levels 1 to 8, where level 1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to label them from the innermost as level 1, moving outward to level 8. That way, each level builds on the previous one.\n\nSo, let's define each level:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1 result)) = (1 + 3*4)\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2 result))\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 8, which is the outermost expression before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing Level 8, I'll multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level8 result.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 9841.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 9841.\n\nI can break this down:\n\n3 * 9000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 800 = 2,400\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 3 * 9841 is actually 29,523, but let me verify:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1\n- 8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 carried over is 25, carry over 2\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 carried over is 29\n\nSo, writing it down: 29,523.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try adding 9841 three times:\n\n9841 + 9841 = 19,682\n\n19,682 + 9841 = Let's add:\n\n19,682 + 9,841:\n\n- 2 + 1 = 3\n- 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1\n- 6 + 8 = 14, plus 1 carried over is 15, carry over 1\n- 9 + 9 = 18, plus 1 carried over is 19\n\nSo, 19,682 + 9,841 = 29,523. Okay, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple steps.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 9,841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each level again step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Plus 1 is 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,000=3,000; 3*93=279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Plus 1 is 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000; 3*280=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Plus 1 is 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841 * 3:\n\n- 1*3=3\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 8*3=24, plus 1 carried over is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 9*3=27, plus 2 carried over is 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n- Since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nWait, but that would make it 29,523. Wait, but when I did it earlier, I thought 9,841 * 3 is 29,523, which is correct because 9,841 * 3:\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial steps, let me try computing the expression from the inside out again, but this time writing down each step more carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me parse this correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next expression). So, starting from the innermost (1+3):\n\n1. Compute (1+3) = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(9,841) = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I can be confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's compute the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9,841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier. So, using the recurrence relation approach also leads to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our case, we have 8 levels, so n=8.\n\nThus, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683.\n\nSo, a_8 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9,841 = 29,523.\n\nWow, that's another way to confirm it. So, using the closed-form formula, we also get 29,523.\n\nTherefore, I'm 100% confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Computed each level step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Verified each computation to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. Realized that the structure forms a recurrence relation and used that to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the result.\n\n5. Cross-checked using multiple methods to ensure that the answer is correct.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also highlighted the importance of careful step-by-step computation to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers of nesting.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly, and I'm confident in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the next level)}\\). \n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 9,841 = 29,523\\)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (... and so on. I can see that this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times it repeats. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nFrom the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, that means I need to compute this from the inside out, nine times. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result8)\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, there are eight layers before the outermost 3*(...). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, no, maybe L1 is the first one we compute, which is the innermost, then L2 is the next layer, etc., until L9, which is the outermost.\n\nBut actually, let me think: each time, we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute each step:\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's our first term. Then, the next term is 1 + 3*(first term), and so on, until we have nine terms, I think. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... eight times ...))). So, how many times do we apply this 1 + 3*()?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count how many 1+3(...) there are.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n7. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n8. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))\n9. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. But the outermost is 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*(layer9). So, I think I need to compute up to layer9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is the ninth layer from the inside, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), up to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see: from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each time we wrap another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of 3's. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, we compute each layer step by step, each time taking the result from the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, if I have nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let's list them out:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3/2 * 3^n = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial problem to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, and each time wrapping another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so:\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, how many layers are there?\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each 1+3(...) has its own set of parentheses.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, but the last one is 1+3 without another opening parenthesis. Wait, no, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, the ninth opening parenthesis is at the innermost 1+3. So, that's nine opening parentheses, but the ninth one is followed by a 1+3 without another opening parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around, so the number of layers is nine, but the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, we had a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the initial expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is the innermost 1+3. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the number of layers again, because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's nine layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is layer1: 1+3, and layer9 is the outermost before the final 3*(...). So, our calculation of a_9 = 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure the approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a simpler version: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, using our formula, n=3 layers.\n\na_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_3=3*40=120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nFor n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem with nine layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the calculations.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, it looks like there are nine sets of parentheses. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. Maybe I can solve this by working from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems logical because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nAlright, let's start. The innermost part is $1 + 3$. That's straightforward. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is:\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. But what's inside the parentheses here? It's the result from the previous step, which is 4. So, substituting that in, we have:\n\n$1 + 3(4)$\n\nCalculating that, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNext layer out, it's again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is now 13. So:\n\n$1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nWait, hold on, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nThe next layer is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$ where the something is 40. So:\n\n$1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\nHmm, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's a bigger jump. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 40 is indeed 120, and 120 plus 1 is 121. Okay, that seems right.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 121. So:\n\n$1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363? Let me confirm: 120 times 3 is 360, plus 3 is 363, yes. So, 363 plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 364.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nWait, 3 times 364. Let me calculate that again. 364 times 3: 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, 4 times 3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 1093.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nWait, 3 times 1093. Let me compute that: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 plus 1 is 3280. That seems right.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 3280.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nWait, 3 times 3280. Let me compute that: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 9841.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nWait, 3 times 9841. Let me compute that: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, 1 times 3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 29524.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\nWait, 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, 4 times 3 is 12. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 88572 plus 1 is 88573. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 88573.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720$\n\nWait, 3 times 88573. Let me compute that: 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, 3 times 3 is 9. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 265719 plus 1 is 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, it's $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 265720.\n\nSo, $1 + 3(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161$\n\nWait, 3 times 265720. Let me compute that: 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60. So, 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 797160 plus 1 is 797161. Correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (all that). So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out, we had the last result as 797161, but that's the result inside the parentheses. So, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 797161.\n\nLet me compute that: 700000 times 3 is 2,100,000, 90000 times 3 is 270,000, 7000 times 3 is 21,000, 100 times 3 is 300, 60 times 3 is 180, 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those up:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3 times 797,161 is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication step again because that's a big number and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use another method to compute 3 times 797,161.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n797,161\nx         3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 x 3 = 3\n\n6 x 3 = 18, carryover 1\n\n1 x 3 = 3 + 1 (carryover) = 4\n\n7 x 3 = 21, carryover 2\n\n9 x 3 = 27 + 2 (carryover) = 29, carryover 2\n\n7 x 3 = 21 + 2 (carryover) = 23, carryover 2\n\nNo more digits, so bring down the 2.\n\nSo, the result is 2,391,483.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and finally, after computing the entire nested expression, we multiplied the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me just go through each step again quickly to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Finally, 3 * 797161 = 2,391,483\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... ))), and the innermost is 1 + 3. How many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1+3... parts: starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds one more layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1+3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of 3(1+3...:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3(1+3)\n\nThen: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have nine layers, I think. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the 3, there's an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each adding another 3(...) after the initial 3. So, in my earlier calculation, I had 12 steps, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to list each layer as I compute it:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3(29524) = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3(88573) = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3(265720) = 797161\n13. Finally, 3 * 797161 = 2,391,483\n\nWait, but if there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...), then after computing nine times, the result inside the parentheses would be 797,161, and then multiplying by 3 gives 2,391,483. But wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out. So, starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, step 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524.\n\nWait, but that's only nine layers, right? So, after nine layers, we have 29,524 inside the parentheses. But then, in my initial calculation, I went further, up to 797,161, which would be more than nine layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3(layer1), which is layer2.\n3. Then, 1 + 3(layer2) is layer3.\n4. Continuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(\n3. And so on, until the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is nine because after the initial 3, there are nine opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1+3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1+3))\n...\nUp to layer 9: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...(1 + 3)...)))\n\nSo, if there are nine layers, then my earlier calculation went up to 29,524, but that would be nine layers. But in my initial calculation, I went further, up to 797,161, which would be more than nine layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 29,524 inside the parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, perhaps I overstepped and included too many layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the expression is 1 + 3 followed by another layer. Let me count the number of 3(1+3... parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time, moving out, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(, so another (\n3. Continuing until the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is nine. Let me count:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, if there are nine layers, then after computing nine times, we have the result inside the outermost parentheses as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my initial calculation where I had 12 layers. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's parse the expression from the inside out, counting each layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I went up to 797,161. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me check the original problem again to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3 followed by another layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is the number of times you can find \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's nine times. Therefore, there are nine layers, meaning that after computing nine times, we have the value inside the outermost parentheses as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 797,161, which would be more than nine layers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including too many layers. Therefore, the correct number of layers is nine, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me list each layer step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went further, up to 797,161, which would be layer 12 or something, but that's incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers. So, I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down the expression with each layer clearly defined.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nLayer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 13 layers, which was incorrect. So, the correct number of layers is nine, leading to 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake by counting too many layers, but with this formula, it's clear that after nine layers, the value is 29,524, leading to 88,572 as the final result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   After computing the ninth layer, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nThe expression is a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n...\nAnd this repeats several times. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so I think I'll have to compute this 9 times, each time working outward.\n\nWait, maybe it's better if I write down each step systematically. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake in the structure. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer).\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them from the innermost as L1, L2, etc., up to L9, where L9 is the outermost. Wait, no, the innermost is the first one, so maybe L1 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer is built upon that.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me start with the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\nInnermost layer (L1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer (L2): 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer (L3): 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext layer (L4): 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext layer (L5): 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext layer (L6): 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext layer (L7): 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext layer (L8): 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext layer (L9): 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost layers.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the layers. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is L1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, L2 is 1 + 3*L1 = 13, L3 is 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on up to L9, which would be 1 + 3*L8.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each time you add another layer until you reach the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (L1)\n2. 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (L2)\n3. 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (L3)\n4. 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (L4)\n5. 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (L5)\n6. 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (L6)\n7. 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (L7)\n8. 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (L8)\n9. 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (L9)\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from L1 as the innermost:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check one more time with another approach, maybe by looking for a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula checks out. Therefore, the innermost layers up to L9 give us a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that formula again because when n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, let me see. It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each layer seems to have the same structure: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, that innermost part is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is (1 + 3*(innermost result)). Wait, so that would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next part is (1 + 3*13). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*40). Let me do that.\n\n3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, this layer is 121.\n\nNext, the expression is (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that.\n\n3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, moving up, this layer is 364.\n\nContinuing, the next part is (1 + 3*364). Let me figure that out.\n\n3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute that.\n\n3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, this part is 3280.\n\nMoving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*3280). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nNext, we have (1 + 3*9841). Let me work that out.\n\n3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, this part is 29524.\n\nGoing one more layer out, the expression is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 is 88572, and 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, this layer is 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*88573.\n\nLet me calculate that. 88573 times 3. Let me break it down:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n70 * 3 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding those up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 88573 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\nWait, 80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000, which adds up to 264,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500, so 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500.\n\n70 * 3 = 210, so 265,500 + 210 = 265,710.\n\n3 * 3 = 9, so 265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*88573 is 265,719.\n\nWait a second, but when I was computing the layers, I thought each step was correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719. Correct.\n\nHmm, so each step seems to check out. So, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=10, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer simplifies to a value that is used in the next outer layer. By calculating each layer sequentially, the final result is found to be 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

Let me write it down to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is (1+3(...)). Since I just solved the innermost part, the next expression is (1+3(4)). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). So, 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next layer out. So, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that's 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(121). Let's calculate that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm keeping track of each step correctly. Let me list them out step by step.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait a second, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and it seems to have nine sets of parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" adds another level. So, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur?\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- The first layer after 3*( is (1 + 3*(...\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...\n- Repeating until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step out adds a layer. Let me count the number of times I have to compute:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*...) starting from the innermost, and then the outermost is 3 times that result. So, I think I did 9 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*previous result). Then the final step is multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I went up to 10 steps, but perhaps that's correct because each of the 9 layers is a (1 + 3*...), and then the outermost is 3*(result). Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... (1 + 3)...))). So, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 9, right? Because each time you have a new (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, that's 9 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*previous result).\n\nSo, let's redo the steps correctly, making sure I don't skip any layers.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing all 9 layers, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 times 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses after 9 layers is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n7. (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n8. (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n9. (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nLet me see: The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found for the nonhomogeneous part, which is a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=0, then a_0 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, after n layers, the value is (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9*19683 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*19683:\n\nWell, 10*19683 = 196,830, so 9*19683 = 196,830 - 19,683 = 177,147.\n\nSo, 9*19683 = 177,147.\n\nThen, a_9 = (177,147 -1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573.\n\nWait, that's different from the 29,524 I got earlier. Hmm, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Because in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would correspond to n=9 in the formula, but let me check.\n\nWait, when n=0, we have a_0 = 4, which is the innermost (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds a new (1 + 3*(...)), so n=1 would be the next layer, which is (1 + 3*(4)) =13, which is correct.\n\nSo, for 9 layers, we have n=9, which would give a_9 as computed above.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step computation earlier, after 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses was 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 is 88,573. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. There must be a mistake either in the formula or in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again.\n\nThe general solution was a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nWait, when n=1, a_1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=5: (9*243 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=6: (9*729 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=7: (9*2187 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=8: (9*6561 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nn=9: (9*19683 -1)/2=177146/2=88573.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step computation, after 9 layers, we had 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 is 88,573, which is exactly one more than 88,572.\n\nSo, that suggests that perhaps the formula is for a_n being the value after n layers, which would already include the multiplication by 3? Wait, no, because in the formula, a_n is the value inside the parentheses after n layers, so the outermost layer is 3*a_n.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), and after 9 layers, the value is a_9, which is 29,524 as per step-by-step, but according to the formula, a_9 is 88,573. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let's rederive the formula correctly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19683 -1)/2 = (177,147 -1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573.\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, after 9 layers, I got 29,524, which is exactly a_8, not a_9.\n\nWait, that's the mistake! Because in the problem, the number of layers is 9, but in the formula, n=0 corresponds to the innermost layer, so n=9 would be the 10th layer. But in the problem, we have 9 layers, so n=8 in the formula would correspond to 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf n=0: (1 + 3) =4.\n\nn=1: (1 + 3*4)=13.\n\nn=2: (1 + 3*13)=40.\n\nn=3: (1 + 3*40)=121.\n\nn=4: (1 + 3*121)=364.\n\nn=5: (1 + 3*364)=1093.\n\nn=6: (1 + 3*1093)=3280.\n\nn=7: (1 + 3*3280)=9841.\n\nn=8: (1 + 3*9841)=29524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, n=8, a_8=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_8 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=88573, which is 1 more than 88572.\n\nWait, so the formula gives a_n as the value after n layers, including the initial (1+3). So, in the problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, which would give a_9=88573, but then the outermost layer is 3*a_9=3*88573=265,719, which is way too big.\n\nBut that's not correct because in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_8), where a_8=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is being misapplied here because in the problem, the number of layers is 9, but in the formula, n=9 corresponds to 10 layers. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in terms of the formula, each layer corresponds to n=1 to n=9, with the innermost being n=1: a_1=13, n=2: a_2=40, etc., up to n=9: a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute a_1 using the formula: (9*3^1 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_2=(9*9 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_3=(9*27 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_4=(9*81 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_5=(9*243 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_6=(9*729 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_7=(9*2187 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_8=(9*6561 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\na_9=(9*19683 -1)/2=177146/2=88573.\n\nWait, so according to the formula, a_9 is 88573, but in the problem, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, which is a_8.\n\nSo, the confusion arises because in the formula, n=9 corresponds to 9 layers, but in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_8). So, the total expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is for a_n being the value after n layers, so a_9 would be after 9 layers, which is 88573, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, no, that can't be because in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so the inner part is a_9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=88573, which would make the total expression 3*88573=265,719, which is way larger than what I computed earlier.\n\nBut that's inconsistent with the step-by-step computation where after 9 layers, the inner value is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, there must be a misalignment in how I'm applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the outermost 3*(...) as part of the layers. Let me think.\n\nIn the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers is 9, and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to the value after n layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so a_9 would be the value after 9 layers, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, which is a_8 in the formula.\n\nWait, that suggests that the formula's n is one less than the number of layers in the problem. Because in the problem, 9 layers correspond to n=8 in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers in the problem.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) =13\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, in the formula, a_n is the value after n layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n=(9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(9*3^9 -1)/2=(9*19683 -1)/2=177146/2=88573.\n\nWait, that's a problem because according to the formula, a_9=88573, but according to step-by-step, a_9=29524.\n\nSo, there's a clear inconsistency here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in deriving the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial condition. Let me check the derivation again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nWait, but in the formula, a_n is the value after n layers, starting from a_0=4.\n\nBut in the problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3)=4, which is a_0.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_1=1 + 3*a_0=13, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=40, etc.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have a_9=88573, but according to the step-by-step, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, which would correspond to a_8=29524.\n\nWait, that suggests that the formula is correct, but in the problem, the number of layers is 9, so n=9, and thus a_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*a_9=265,719, which contradicts the step-by-step computation.\n\nBut that can't be right because the step-by-step computation is straightforward and each step was verified.\n\nTherefore, the mistake must be in the formula's application. Wait, perhaps the formula counts the number of multiplications by 3 differently.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula is for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0=4.\n\nSo, a_1=1 + 3*4=13\n\na_2=1 + 3*13=40\n\na_3=1 + 3*40=121\n\na_4=1 + 3*121=364\n\na_5=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na_6=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na_7=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na_8=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\na_9=1 + 3*29524=88573\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9=88573.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), which would be 3*88573=265,719.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, we computed 3*(a_8)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's a discrepancy because the formula counts the layers differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), which would be a_9=88573, and then the outermost 3*(a_9)=265,719.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, I only went up to a_8=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) layers in the problem.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression has 9 instances of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(.\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times \"1 + 3*(...\" occurs is 9 times, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, that would mean n=9 layers, so a_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*a_9=265,719.\n\nBut that contradicts the step-by-step computation where I stopped at a_8=29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation by stopping too early.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the problem:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) =13\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the problem only has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so the 10th step is the multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the formula, a_9=88573, but in the problem, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is correct, but in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), which would be 3*88573=265,719, but that contradicts the step-by-step.\n\nWait, no, the problem's structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the innermost is (1 + 3)=4, which is a_0=4.\n\nThen, each layer is a_1=1 + 3*a_0=13, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=40, and so on, up to a_9=88573.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*88573=265,719.\n\nBut that's not matching the step-by-step computation where I stopped at a_8=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the problem. Let me look again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9=88573, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=265,719.\n\nBut in my step-by-step computation, I only computed up to a_8=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, that suggests that"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. It seems like a nested expression where each level has a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Each of those \"something\" parts is another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 3 times (1 plus 3 times ...) things.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. So, let's identify where the innermost part is. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one level out, we have another expression that involves this result. Let me see how that's structured.\n\nThe next level out would be: 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, after computing 1 + 3, which is 4, the next step is to compute 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n2. Compute the next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n\nSo, step 1 gave us 4, so 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so now we have 13.\n\nMoving out another level, we have another similar structure: 1 + 3*(result from the previous step). Let's do that.\n\n3. Compute the next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n\nStep 2 gave us 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So now we have 40.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm following this correctly. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, it's a recursive process where each step depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me try to outline this step by step to avoid confusion:\n\n- Step 1: Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n- Step 2: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n- Step 3: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n- Step 4: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n- Step 5: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n- Step 6: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- Step 7: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- Step 8: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- Step 9: Compute next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n- Finally, the outermost step: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me check how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. Another\n4. Another\n5. Another\n6. Another\n7. Another\n8. Another\n9. Another\n10. The innermost one.\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, we have 9 levels of nesting. So, the innermost is step 1, and then each step out is another level, so we should have 9 steps before multiplying by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but when I started counting earlier, I only went up to step 9, which was 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524, and then the outermost step was 3*(29524). So that would be step 10. Let me verify.\n\nYes, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the first 3(...). So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and there are 9 of them. Therefore, starting from the innermost, we compute 9 levels, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then finally multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, let me list each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing all 9 levels, we have 29524. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n10. 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 multiplied by 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- There's no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you have multiple nested operations, it's easy to miscount the number of levels or make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. The multiplication by 3 at each level is accurate, and adding 1 after each multiplication. So, after nine iterations, we reach 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To make sure, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, which might help in computing it more efficiently or verifying the result.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost term a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier step.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the number of levels in our original problem, we can compute a_9 as:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier result after 9 steps. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is of the form 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next level). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me try to parse it. It seems like each part is of the form 3 times something, where that something is (1 plus 3 times another similar expression). So, it's like a chain of these 3(1 + 3(...)) terms. Maybe I can compute it starting from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That makes sense because the innermost parentheses will be evaluated first, just like how in regular math you do the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let's start from the innermost expression and move outward. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So that's the starting point.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - The innermost expression is 1 + 3. So, 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n2. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, let's compute that:\n   - So, it's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13.\n\n3. Next level out, we have another 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let's calculate that:\n   - 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 equals 40.\n\n4. Moving outward again, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(result from step 3):\n   - 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 equals 121.\n\n5. Next level, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 4):\n   - 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 equals 364.\n\n6. Continuing outward, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 5):\n   - 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 6):\n   - 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so adding those gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Moving outward, we have another 1 + 3*(result from step 7):\n   - 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 8):\n   - 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3*(result from step 9):\n    - So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from step 1:\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, let me compute that again. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the structure, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, each step is like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each step as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times the expression repeats. Each time, we have a 3(1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is the first a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So, 9 terms in total.\n\nWait, actually, the problem has 8 sets of 3(1 + ...). Let me check the original problem again:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time another 1+3*(previous). So, how many levels are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each level adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3(1+... parts.\n\nWait, the first part is 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. So, how many times does 3(1+... occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, the outermost is 3(...), then inside that is another 3(...), and so on. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 outermost\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n3. Continuing, each time, so let me count the number of 3(1+... terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 levels because after the first 3(1+..., there are 7 more 3(1+... terms. Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent 3(...) is nested inside.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+... terms. The first is 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 levels because from the innermost 1+3, each time you go out, you add another 3(1+... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc., up to 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I did 9 steps, each time computing from the innermost to the outermost, which gave me 88572. So, maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find D, the steady-state solution, set a_n = a_{n-1} = D.\n\nThen, D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, and recognizing the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the result step by step, and also derive a closed-form formula to confirm the result.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just verify the arithmetic again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expressions from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 3 times (1 plus the result of the next inner expression). Using this method, we compute each level step by step, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Expression:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Next Level Out:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Outermost Expression:**\n    - Compute \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding what this expression is. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. It looks like there are multiple layers here, maybe nine layers in total? Let me count the opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2014 yeah, that's nine 3s multiplied by something. So, perhaps I should start solving from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me write this down step by step, starting from the inside. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's correct. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). But after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, do I need to multiply by 3 again? Let me check the original expression.\n\nLooking back, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is 3*(...), where inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so I think I might have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, up to E_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to compute E_9 first, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me recast my earlier computation:\n\nCompute E_1 to E_9, then multiply E_9 by 3.\n\nSo, starting with E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let me compute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nBut let me check my E_9 computation again because that seems like a big number.\n\nWait, E_1 = 4, E_2 = 13, E_3 = 40, E_4 = 121, E_5 = 364, E_6 = 1093, E_7 = 3280, E_8 = 9841, E_9 = 29524.\n\nWait, each step is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, let me verify E_3:\n\nE_2 = 13, so E_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the nested structure, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, such a recurrence can be solved. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a linear recurrence is E_n = a^n * E_0 + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), where E_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in our case, E_1 = 4, but let me see if I can adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define E_0 as 1, so that E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nThen, the general formula would be E_n = 3^n * E_0 + (1*(3^n - 1))/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nIf E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=0, E_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is correct.\n\nFor n=1, E_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2, E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct.\n\nn=3: E_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for n >=0.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the formula gives E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to express the entire expression as a single formula?\n\nLet me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3.\n\nSo, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, this is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, the recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which we've already solved.\n\nSo, perhaps another way to think about it is to expand the entire expression.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nEach time we have a 1 added, and then multiplied by 3, so perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand this, it's like 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, because each layer adds another 1.\n\nWait, actually, each layer adds a new 1, so the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to adjust for the additions of 1 at each step.\n\nWait, let me consider that each time we have 1 added before multiplying by 3. So, it's like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, that's similar to the recurrence relation E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, which we've already solved.\n\nSo, using the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we did earlier.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression can be written as (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWhich is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{11}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the problem. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost part and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the formula for the linear recurrence relation \\(E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\nThen, multiplying by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out how to approach this. It seems like each layer is a similar expression: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nWow, that's nine layers deep. Okay, let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Since the innermost was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me write that down step by step to avoid confusion.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, that layer is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 3):\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nSo, that's 121.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n5. 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nMoving on:\n\n6. 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093.\n\nHmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Well, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9). So:\n\n10. 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. It's easy to get lost in so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think I did it right.\n\nI guess the key here was to tackle each layer one by one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. It might seem tedious with nine layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I just had to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid mistakes. It's also a good idea to double-check each step, especially when dealing with larger numbers, to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that each layer after the first is following a pattern: each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, if I think about it, each step is a kind of recursive computation, where each term depends on the one before it. That might be a way to generalize this kind of problem for different numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are nine layers, I just had to compute each one sequentially. It's a good exercise in careful arithmetic and attention to detail. I almost made a mistake when multiplying 3 by 9841, but I caught it by doing the multiplication step by step. It's easy to miscount when dealing with larger numbers, so taking it one digit at a time helps prevent errors.\n\nOverall, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572. I went through each step methodically, checked my work, and didn't see any mistakes. So, I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of (1+3) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. ... up to 9 layers?\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time it's 1+3(...), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, excluding the last one.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, the first is (1+3), then each time we have another (1+3(...)), so how many layers?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. ... up to 9 layers because each time we add another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1+3*(...), and the innermost is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times the pattern (1+3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each time it's 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more (1+3(...)), so in the given expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLet me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent (1+3(...) is nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of times you have a (1+3(...)) expression. Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression is 3 times (1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more (1+3(...)) expressions. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3) is at position 2, then each subsequent (1+3) is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each (1+3) is inside another, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as a sequence:\n\nLet me consider the entire expression as follows:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*E_i, where E_i is the next layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Each E_i corresponds to a layer, starting from E1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and after computing E9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Maybe I should verify a couple of the layers.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers differently.\n\nFor example, let's compute E3 again: E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've done each step correctly, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: E_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nE_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nE_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nE_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nE_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nE_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nE_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nE_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nE_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works perfectly.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost (1+3) and working up to the outermost layer. Using a step-by-step approach, each layer is computed until the final result is obtained, which is then multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to parse it. It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and then that whole thing is multiplied by 3 again. So maybe it's a repeated pattern. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's write this out. The innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's substitute. The next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3). But wait, that 1 + 3 is the innermost, which we already computed as 4. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12, which equals 13. Hmm, okay, so the second layer gives me 13.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I should write down each step clearly. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, actually, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ...)), and this nesting continues until the innermost part is 1+3.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and this happens multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n... and so on, until the outermost 3*(...)\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. Each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. But when I started counting earlier, I went up to 10 steps, which might have included the outermost 3*(...). So perhaps there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we have a 3*() that contains another 1 + 3*(). Let's count the number of 3*() parts.\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(...)\n2. Inside that, 3*(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many 3*() layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3*.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats 8 times, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, actually, the number of times we have 3*(...) is equal to the number of layers minus one. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just proceed step by step, computing each layer from the inside out, as I initially started.\n\nSo, step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 10: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so I went through 10 steps, but perhaps the outermost 3*(...) is step 10, while steps 1 through 9 were the inner layers. So, let's confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (step 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (step 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (step 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (step 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (step 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (step 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (step 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (step 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (step 9)\n10. Finally, 3*(29524) = 88572 (step 10)\n\nWait, but let me check: each step after step 1 is adding another layer. So, step 1 is the innermost, step 2 is one layer out, and so on until step 9, which would be the layer just inside the outermost 3*(...). Then step 10 is the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nBut wait, when I count the number of 3*(...) layers, starting from the outermost, how many are there? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3*(...) layers is 9, because each (1 + 3*(...)) is inside another 3*(...), starting from the outermost. So, perhaps I have 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), making a total of 10 steps, including the final multiplication by 3. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (innermost)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems right. So, step 1 is the innermost, step 10 is the outermost. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. 3*29524 = Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...), right? Because each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(...), each containing another 1 + 3*(...). So, that would mean that the step-by-step process I followed is correct, with 9 inner steps and then the final multiplication by 3, making it 10 steps in total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each step manually. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D\nSimplify the right side: 3*C*3^{n-1} = C*3^n, so:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many layers do we have? From the problem, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, and each layer adds another a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nIn the original problem, how many a_n terms are there? Let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another a_n, so:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40\n\n... and so on, up to a_9, which is the result before the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n=9, gives a_9=29,524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe found the general solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, just computing each step manually, I arrived at the same result, so that gives me more confidence.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding what's going on here. It seems like a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer has a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, it's like a chain of these operations. Since it's nested multiple times, maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to compute each one starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of nested expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) around it. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, so let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from above)\n3. Then another: 1 + 3*(result from above)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", so starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, so that's one layer.\n- Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3), so that's two layers.\n- Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), so three layers.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there in total?\n\nLooking at the original problem, the expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many times do we have 1 + 3 before we reach the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so let's see how many times this happens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work from the inside out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3\n   - That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   - So, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, let me confirm that. 3*(13) is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes.\n\nNext layer:\n\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nContinuing:\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121)\n   - 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364)\n   - 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nWait, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, 1092 + 1 is 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093)\n   - Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280)\n   - 3*3280: Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, that's 9841.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841)\n   - Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 29523 +1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that calculation again because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, yes, 29523 +1 is 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, which is:\n\n10. 3*(result from step 9)\n    - So, 3*(29524). Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from right to left: 2,7,7,7,8,8.\n\nWait, that would be 88,772? Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 =27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did it the other way, I got 88,572 as well. So, yes, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the outermost layer is 3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because this seems like a big number, and I want to ensure each step was correct.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Outermost: 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check step 5 again: 3*(121) is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841. Let me compute this again to be sure. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, step 10: 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nWait a minute, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought the result was 88,572, which matches the other method. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3 the next layer.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each a_i is computed correctly, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_i. Let's see:\n\nEach a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_i = (3^{i} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nBecause the recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIf I have a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, then the homogeneous solution is a_i^h = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_i^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen i=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for a_i, the formula is (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for i=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for each layer i, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, starting from the innermost layer, which is a_1 =4, and moving outwards, we have a total of 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9, and then the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute a_i directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nBut since I had already computed each step manually, it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to ensure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSince each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut since we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as computed.\n\nSo, I think I've verified it sufficiently.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let me try to understand what's going on here. It seems like a nested expression where each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and this pattern repeats multiple times. So, it's like a chain of parentheses, each one containing another similar expression. That does look a bit intimidating, but maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving outwards: 1 + 3( ... )\n3. Repeating this until the outermost 3( ... )\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of nested parentheses. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so let me count them:\n\nStarting from the left, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let's see how many layers there are.\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the last one.\n2. Then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... ))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to define each layer:\n\nLet\u2019s define L1 as the innermost part: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9, perhaps, since I can see 9 layers of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me check the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. First layer: (1 + 3(...\n2. Second layer: (1 + 3(...\n3. Third layer: (1 + 3(...\n4. Fourth layer: (1 + 3(...\n5. Fifth layer: (1 + 3(...\n6. Sixth layer: (1 + 3(...\n7. Seventh layer: (1 + 3(...\n8. Eighth layer: (1 + 3(...\n9. Ninth layer: (1 + 3))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, starting from L1 = (1 + 3) up to L9, which is the outermost layer before the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should start numbering from the innermost as L1 and go outwards. So, L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then L2 is the next one out, which is 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, which is the outermost layer inside the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(L1)), which is L2. Then L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on until L9. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, I need to compute L1 through L9 and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524 = 1572\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again because 3*29524.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and check each L1 to L9.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: Let's break it down.\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3's inside the parentheses. Let me see:\n\nEach layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\n\nSo, each time, it's one more layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, L1 through L9 as I computed before.\n\nSo, 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, L1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check that with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and using the formula gives the same result without computing each layer individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as a geometric series with ratio 3, but let me see.\n\nWait, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nBut that's an infinite series, but in our case, it's finite with 9 layers. So, maybe we can model it as a finite geometric series.\n\nBut since we've already found a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost layer and work our way outwards.\n\nWe define each layer \\(L_i\\) as follows:\n- \\(L_1 = 1 + 3\\)\n- \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1\\)\n- \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2\\)\n- and so on, until \\(L_9\\).\n\nCalculating each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of \\(L_9\\) by 3:\n\\[3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards might be the best approach. I think this is a case of multiple nested parentheses, so I should handle them one by one.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see if I can visualize it better. It's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). That inner expression is similar: 1 + 3 multiplied by another one, and so on. So, if I start from the inside, each step will involve computing a value inside the parentheses and then substituting it back into the outer expression.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost part: 1+3, then that result is inside another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, so that means I have nine layers to compute. Wait, actually, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is the last one.\n2. Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list them as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...)))). Each time, a new layer is added by 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, and then each subsequent layer uses that result.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 2 result: 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 result: 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 result: 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 result: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 result: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's do 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 +9=3279.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 result: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 result: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9.

Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4, so:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. But since both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same result, I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost outwards. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the result 29524 for the ninth layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you start from the innermost one and work your way out. So, I should probably start by evaluating the innermost expression and then move outward.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's a series of 1 + 3(...), each time multiplied by 3. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me check: the innermost is (1+3), then the next is 1+3*(that result), and so on. How many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, I see each 1+3(...) is nested inside another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s before I get to the innermost 1+3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, so each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The outermost 3\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Then another\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. So, starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are nine 3s before the innermost 1+3. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(the previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by evaluating from the innermost outwards. Let me start from the innermost expression and work my way up. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, so let me write down each step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost 1+3. Wait, maybe a better approach is to count how many times the expression 1 + 3*(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that the innermost expression is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer and compute its value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that:\n\n3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nLet me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each layer is wrapped in 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3, each nested inside another. So, each layer from 1 to 9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer 9). So, I think I did compute 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(previous result). So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all layers correctly. Let me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just verify each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I missed a layer or something because the expression seems to have 9 layers of 1+3, but I'm not sure. Let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3(...) occurs in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...) around it. So, the next one is 1+3*(1+3).\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on.\n\nSo, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each time you have a 3 followed by a (, so each 3( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of 3( in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first is 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on. Let me count how many 3( there are.\n\n1. 3( at the very beginning.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(.\n\n3. Then another 3(.\n\n4. Another 3(.\n\n5. Another 3(.\n\n6. Another 3(.\n\n7. Another 3(.\n\n8. Another 3(.\n\n9. Another 3(.\n\nWait, so that's 9 instances of 3(, which would mean 9 layers. So, each 3( starts a new layer, so there are 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, that aligns with my previous calculation.\n\nSo, Layer 1 is the innermost, 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me verify a couple of layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with so many layers.\n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ".\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, it seems like each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count: starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. So that's nine layers of multiplication and addition. That might take a while, but I can handle it by working from the inside out.\n\nAlright, let me write this down step by step. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. So, the innermost part is just 1+3, right? Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression now becomes:\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+4)))))))))$.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost parentheses was the last one, so the expression before that was 1+3(...). So yes, replacing the innermost (1+3) with 4, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(that 4). Let me proceed step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as a level, starting from level 1 as the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: Now, moving one layer out, the expression is 1 + 3*(result from Level 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result from Level 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: Moving outward again, it's 1 + 3*(result from Level 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Level 4). So, 1 + 3*121. Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: Continuing outward, it's 1 + 3*(result from Level 5). So, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Level 6). That's 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: Moving outward again, it's 1 + 3*(result from Level 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(result from Level 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(result from Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3.\n\nCalculating 29524*3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 0, so 0*3 is 0, write that down.\n- The first digit is 2, 2*3 is 6, write that down.\n\nPutting it all together: 6, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 0*3=0, write down 0.\n- Millions place: 2*3=6, write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplied by 3, we get:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572. Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the digits, I included a 0, but actually, 29524 is five digits, so when multiplied by 3, the result is 88572, which is a 5-digit number as well. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit low because 30,000*3 is 90,000, so 29,524*3 should be just under that, which is 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another approach. Let me break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n9000*3 = 27000\n500*3 = 1500\n20*3 = 60\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier in my step-by-step, I had each level leading up to 29524 at Level 9, so then the final step is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount each level to ensure that I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, each level's result is used in the next level's computation.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 7 again. 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*3280: 3280*3=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So that's the final result.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to ensure that I didn't miss a level.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a level. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...)\n\nWait, actually, the initial expression is 3(...). Then inside that, it's 1+3(...), and each of those has another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's level 1.\n\nThen each layer above that adds another level. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is two operations per level, but in terms of nested parentheses, it's nine layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had nine levels, each corresponding to one set of parentheses. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation again because sometimes when I'm doing multiple steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me redo each level quickly:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, perhaps the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is part of a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...)\n\nWait, so that's nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, which means nine layers. So, my earlier calculation with nine levels is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*(1 + previous) which is 3 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this, maybe using a geometric series or something.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but wait, in my earlier calculation, Level 2 was 13, not 15. Hmm, that suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but in my earlier calculation, I had 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is different.\n\nWait, this suggests that I might have misapplied the structure. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the layer above that is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had different results. So, perhaps I made a mistake in how I structured the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the order of operations. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write the original expression as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the level, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's compute each E_n step by step:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about each layer being 3*(1 + previous), I was getting different numbers, but perhaps I was miscounting the layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for E_n, since each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations. I can recompute each E_n:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ".\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. It seems like each part is of the form 3 times something in parentheses, and inside those parentheses, it's 1 plus another similar expression. So, maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works for these kinds of nested problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me count them again to make sure. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). So, the innermost one is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...).

Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + f(n-1)). Wait, but in our case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each next layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, perhaps I should define it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each layer as starting from the innermost. Let me try to write each step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, hold on, this is different from before. Wait, I think I may have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is 3*(...), then inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1 + 3( inside:\n\n- The first one is inside the first 3(...): 1 + 3(...)\n- Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...)\n- Repeating until the innermost one.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), the innermost is (1 + 3), so each time we go in, we have another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each \"1 + 3(\" represents a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, layer 2: 3*(layer 1) = 3*4 = 12, then layer 3: 1 + layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent it as a recursive formula.\n\nLet me define f(n) as the value of the nth layer from the inside.\n\nSo, the innermost layer is n=1: f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out, n=2: f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the outermost layer is 3*f(9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is f(9).\n\nSo, the total value would be 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems way too large. I must have made a mistake somewhere because earlier I thought it was 1092, but that was probably an error in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me check again. So, the problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" inside:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), the first inner is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent one adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n3. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*(...) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*40 = 120\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(...) = 1 + 120 = 121\n6. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*121 = 363\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(...) = 1 + 363 = 364\n8. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*364 = 1092\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(...) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(...) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nWait, but that's only 10 layers, but the problem only has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is structured as follows:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is 1 + 3*(...), and so on, with nine layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9 because there are nine \"1 + 3(\" instances inside.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize it as a tree. Each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but that's 10 layers, but the problem only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is that each \"1 + 3(\" represents a new layer, and there are nine such layers. So, let's start from the innermost and go out.\n\nSo, starting with:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total number of layers is nine, starting from Layer1 as (1+3), up to Layer9 as 1 + 3*(Layer8), and then the outermost 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, the final result is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried defining f(n), I ended up with 3*f(9) = 88572, which seems way too high. So, I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and that each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, let me try to structure it step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(Step1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nStep3: Compute (1 + Step2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep4: Compute 3*(Step3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nStep5: Compute (1 + Step4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep6: Compute 3*(Step5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nStep7: Compute (1 + Step6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep8: Compute 3*(Step7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nStep9: Compute (1 + Step8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep10: Compute 3*(Step9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, but the problem only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(...), where ... is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) or 1 + ... So, perhaps the number of layers is nine, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer1, up to layer9 being 1 + 3*(layer8), and then the outermost 3*(layer9) is layer10.\n\nBut the problem is to compute the entire expression, which is 3*(layer9), so that would be 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers inside. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then multiply by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me try again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding value:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. Outermost: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total value is 1092.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the f(n) approach, I ended up with a much larger number, 88572, which I'm now confident is wrong because it doesn't align with the step-by-step approach.\n\nSo, perhaps I should stick with the step-by-step method, which gives me 1092 as the final answer.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more by writing out each step clearly:\n\nCompute the innermost first:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Compute 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Compute (1 + 12) = 13\n\n4. Compute 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Compute (1 + 39) = 40\n\n6. Compute 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Compute (1 + 120) = 121\n\n8. Compute 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Compute (1 + 363) = 364\n\n10. Compute 3*(364) = 1092\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the step-by-step results:\n\nAfter step1: 4\n\nAfter step2: 12\n\nAfter step3: 13\n\nAfter step4: 39\n\nAfter step5: 40\n\nAfter step6: 120\n\nAfter step7: 121\n\nAfter step8: 363\n\nAfter step9: 364\n\nAfter step10: 1092\n\nI notice that every even step is a multiplication by 3, and every odd step is adding 1.\n\nSo, starting from 4:\n\n- Step2: 4*3 = 12\n\n- Step3: 12 + 1 = 13\n\n- Step4: 13*3 = 39\n\n- Step5: 39 + 1 = 40\n\n- Step6: 40*3 = 120\n\n- Step7: 120 + 1 = 121\n\n- Step8: 121*3 = 363\n\n- Step9: 363 + 1 = 364\n\n- Step10: 364*3 = 1092\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think.\n\nEach layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, if we have n layers, each time we do: result = 3*(1 + result).\n\nWait, but in this case, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 4 (innermost), and then each subsequent term is a_{k} = 3*(1 + a_{k-1}).\n\nSo, a1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nWait, but that's not matching my earlier results. Wait, perhaps I'm misdefining the sequence.\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step, after step1: 4, step2: 12, step3: 13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model it as a recurrence relation where each term is built from the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but that doesn't match my earlier step-by-step. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, in my step-by-step, after step1: 4, then step2: 3*4=12, then step3: 1 + 12=13, step4: 3*13=39, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the recurrence is:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + a2\n\na4 = 3*a3\n\na5 = 1 + a4\n\nAnd so on, alternating between multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, for n layers, starting from a1, each even step is a multiplication by 3, each odd step (after the first) is adding 1.\n\nSo, for nine layers, we have:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*a1 = 12\n\na3 = 1 + a2 = 13\n\na4 = 3*a3 = 39\n\na5 = 1 + a4 = 40\n\na6 = 3*a5 = 120\n\na7 = 1 + a6 = 121\n\na8 = 3*a7 = 363\n\na9 = 1 + a8 = 364\n\na10 = 3*a9 = 1092\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each step.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nAfter 1 layer: 4\n\nAfter 2 layers: 12\n\nAfter 3 layers: 13\n\nAfter 4 layers: 39\n\nAfter 5 layers: 40\n\nAfter 6 layers: 120\n\nAfter 7 layers: 121\n\nAfter 8 layers: 363\n\nAfter 9 layers: 364\n\nAfter 10 layers: 1092\n\nI notice that every two layers, the result seems to be multiplied by 3 and then increased by 1, but that's not exactly a clean pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation where each pair of layers (multiply by 3, then add 1) can be represented as a function.\n\nWait, let me consider that each two layers can be represented as:\n\nStarting from a, after two layers: 3*(1 + 3*a) = 3 + 9*a\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nIf a = 4 (after layer1), then after two more layers:\n\nLayer2: 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWhich is 3 + 9*4 = 3 + 36 = 39, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it as a recurrence where each step alternates between operations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a function where each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost value.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to accept that the step-by-step computation gives us 1092, and that's the answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute it again:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\nNext layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\nNext layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext layer: 3*(121) = 363\n\nNext layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 1092.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a calculator to verify, but since I'm doing this manually, I think this is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1092.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 13 = 39\n   \\]\n\n5. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n6. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\n7. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n8. Multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 121 = 363\n   \\]\n\n9. Add 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n10. Multiply by 3 for the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 364 = 1092\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{1092}\\)."

So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nStart with the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, let me make sure I parse this correctly.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then moving outwards each time.\n\nLet me write each step down.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9, maybe. Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), which is layer 1. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), which is layer 2, and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside each other.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see.\n\nFrom the innermost 1+3, which is layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), then layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside the previous one. So, how many 3s are there? Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside, then each (1+3(...)) adds another 3. Let's see: starting with 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s inside. Let's count the number of 3s after the initial one.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, each (1+3(...) contains a 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the number of 3s inside the parentheses is 8, because each layer adds another 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, total layers are 9? Wait, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time you have 1+3(...), and the innermost is the 9th one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just start evaluating from the innermost and work outwards, regardless of how many layers there are. Let's do that.\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 88573*3. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*265720.\n\nCompute that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, no, that's incorrect because 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20? Wait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20? Wait, 200000 + 60000 is 260000, plus 5000 is 265000, plus 700 is 265700, plus 20 is 265720. So, 3*265720.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute directly:\n\n265720 * 3:\n\n200000*3 = 600000\n\n60000*3 = 180000\n\n5000*3 = 15000\n\n700*3 = 2100\n\n20*3 = 60\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160\n\nSo, 3*265720 = 797,160.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 265,720 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 265,720 * 3:\n\n7 * 3 = 21, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, carryover 2.\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n265,720\n\n*         3\n\n= 797,160\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n265,720\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, the result is 797,160. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps because that's a lot of layers. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that's only 9 layers? But in the original problem, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, counting the number of (1+3) inside each other: Let's see, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(...)). The first 3 is outside, then inside it's (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears inside each other.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1+3, then inside that is another 1+3, and so on until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: after the first 3, each ( starts a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, the first ( is layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds a layer.\n\nSo, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. Wait, no, let me count.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3 is a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside:\n\n- The first (1+3) is layer 1.\n\n- Inside that, another (1+3) is layer 2.\n\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3) is layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that with another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I evaluated earlier, I only went up to layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9's result, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I thought the outermost layer was 3*(layer9), but in my initial evaluation, I went up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, but then I thought that was the final result. But now I'm confused because in the problem statement, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 times the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 797,160, but that was because I continued to layer10, which isn't actually present in the problem.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by adding an extra layer beyond what's in the problem. Let me recount.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, counting the number of (1+3) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each preceding one adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times (1+3) appears inside each other.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3) before it. Let's count the number of (1+3)s:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so:\n\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by 9 opening parentheses before the innermost (1+3). Wait, no, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\n- The first (1+3) is layer 1.\n\n- Then inside that, another (1+3) is layer 2.\n\n- And so on until the innermost (1+3) is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one, and the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the 9th layer.\n\nSo, starting from layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by layer9's result: 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 29524*3.\n\nLet's compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 797,160, but that was because I miscounted the layers and went one layer too deep. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I initially thought there were more layers, but upon recounting, it's 9 layers, leading to 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me write that down. That would be 1 + 3, which is 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, I have another 1 + 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost part. Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3 times the next inner expression. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out with more structure. Let me denote each level as a step. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Step 2 is 13.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Step 3 is 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Step 4 is 121.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost, each time I step out, I add another layer.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, and each time we have 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost, that's the first step. Then each subsequent layer adds another step. So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, let's see how many times we have to compute this.\n\nWait, maybe I can count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. From the innermost, that's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost as step 1, then each step out is step 2, 3, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, which is step 1.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1+3*(step1), which is step 2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(step2) is step3.\n\nContinuing this, how many steps do we have? Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after 3(, there's a 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me see:\n\nTotal layers: Let's see, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...). Then inside that, another (1+3(...), and so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 1+3 occurs as a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3. So, let's count how many 1+3 expressions there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3: that's 1.\n\nThen, each layer outwards adds another 1+3(...). So, the next one is 1+3(1+3): that's 2.\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3)): that's 3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: 1\n\n- Then, moving out, we have 1+3(1+3): 2\n\n- Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)): 3\n\n- Continuing, each time we add another layer, so up to 9 layers? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 followed by 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, 9 times.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each step is 1+3*(previous step). So, starting from step1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen step2: 1+3*step1=1+3*4=13\n\nStep3:1+3*13=40\n\nStep4:1+3*40=121\n\nStep5:1+3*121=364\n\nStep6:1+3*364=1093\n\nStep7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nStep8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nStep9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost step9. So, the entire expression is 3*(step9). So, let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each step is 1+3*(previous step). So, step1 is innermost:4\n\nThen step2:1+3*4=13\n\nStep3:1+3*13=40\n\nStep4:1+3*40=121\n\nStep5:1+3*121=364\n\nStep6:1+3*364=1093\n\nStep7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nStep8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nStep9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by step9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the steps.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's (1+3(...)), so the number of times 1+3 is nested is 9 times. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and inside that, (1+3(...)), etc., 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a tower of exponents, but with multiplication. Wait, no, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, but let me just proceed step by step.\n\nSo, step1: innermost 1+3=4\n\nstep2:1+3*4=13\n\nstep3:1+3*13=40\n\nstep4:1+3*40=121\n\nstep5:1+3*121=364\n\nstep6:1+3*364=1093\n\nstep7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nstep8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nstep9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStep1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nStep2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nStep3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nStep4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nStep5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nStep6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the steps correctly. The original expression has how many layers?\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, starting from the innermost 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times do we have 1+3(...)? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost as 1, each layer adds another one.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the expression is 3 followed by 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 1+3 is nested. Each time, it's 1+3*(next layer). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had step1 to step9, each corresponding to a layer, leading to the final result of 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3).\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))).\n\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))).\n\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))).\n\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))).\n\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))).\n\n9. Finally, the outermost is 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))).\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each step corresponds to one layer, so 9 steps from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nSo, my initial calculation of step1 to step9 is correct, leading to 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStep1:1+3=4.\n\nStep2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nStep3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\na_4=1+3*40=121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. We can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\n=> K -3K =1\n\n=> -2K=1\n\n=> K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} -1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising.\n\nLet me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to arrive at the same result, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression.\n\nBut, since the problem didn't specify to use a particular method, and given that the expression is manageable with step-by-step computation, both methods are valid.\n\nIn summary, by expanding each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and computing each subsequent layer, we arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 + 3 times the result of the previous step. After computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression simplifies step by step until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times something. So, the innermost part is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result. Let me count the number of 3s and parentheses to make sure I understand the structure correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n3. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)), and so on.\n\nSo, there are nine layers in total because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1 + 3(\" adds one, and I can see there are nine of them. So, yes, nine layers. That means I'll have to compute this expression nine times, starting from the innermost.\n\nAlright, let's start computing step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3).\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4.\n\n**Step 2:** Now, moving one layer outward, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)).\n\nSince Step 1 gave us 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4).\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, the second layer is 13.\n\n**Step 3:** Next layer is (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)), which is (1 + 3*13).\n\nCalculating: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nSo, the third layer is 40.\n\n**Step 4:** Moving outward again, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 3)).\n\nThat's (1 + 3*40). \n\n3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nFourth layer: 121.\n\n**Step 5:** Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 4)).\n\nSo, (1 + 3*121).\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nThen, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nFifth layer: 364.\n\n**Step 6:** Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 5)).\n\nWhich is (1 + 3*364).\n\nCalculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSixth layer: 1093.\n\n**Step 7:** Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 6)).\n\nWhich is (1 + 3*1093).\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nSeventh layer: 3280.\n\n**Step 8:** Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 7)).\n\nWhich is (1 + 3*3280).\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nEighth layer: 9841.\n\n**Step 9:** Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 8)).\n\nWhich is (1 + 3*9841).\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's compute this carefully.\n\nFirst, 9000*3 is 27000.\n\nThen, 800*3 is 2400.\n\nThen, 40*3 is 120.\n\nThen, 1*3 is 3.\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nNinth layer: 29524.\n\n**Step 10:** Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from Step 9).\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSeems like all the steps check out. Each time, I calculated the innermost expression first and worked my way outward, making sure to compute each multiplication and addition correctly. I also broke down each multiplication into manageable parts to avoid errors, especially with the larger numbers towards the end.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the final result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested parentheses problem that requires computing from the innermost layer outward. Each layer involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. By systematically evaluating each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So it's like a recursive structure. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3).\n- Then moving out, each layer adds another 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the left, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)).

So, perhaps there are 9 layers of 3*(...). Wait, no, because each time you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a series of nested expressions.

Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*L1, which is L2. Then, 1 + 3*L2 is L3, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(L9), because there are 9 layers of 3*(...).

Let me approach it differently.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the result of the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the layers are 9, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's L2.\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), which is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first (1+3( is after the first 3.\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(, and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first (1+3( is at the beginning, then inside that, another (1+3(, etc., until the innermost (1+3), which doesn't have a ( after it.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a (, which is an opening parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Then inside that: another (\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th opening parenthesis. So, there are 9 layers, each with their own (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, how many are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the first opening parenthesis.\n\nThen inside that, another (, which is the second opening parenthesis.\n\nContinuing, each time we have a new (, until the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because each (1+3( adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th opening parenthesis. So, there are 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the layers are L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost (1+3) = 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me create a table to compute each L from L1 to L9.\n\n- L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n- L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n- L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n- L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\nFirst, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L9). So, the total value is 3*L9.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again because sometimes I might have missed a layer or miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's recount the number of layers to ensure that L9 is indeed the correct layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is L1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first (1+3( after the first 3 is the first layer.\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3( is the second layer.\n3. Continuing, each time we have a new (1+3(, which is a new layer.\n\nHow many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3, we have 9 instances of (1+3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L1 to L9, with L9 being the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again. L9 is 1 + 3*L8, and L8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is following a recurrence relation where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> 2K = -1\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, and also used a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by L9:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
