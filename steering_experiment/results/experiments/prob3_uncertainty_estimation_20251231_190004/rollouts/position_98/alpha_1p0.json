    "text": " Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

    "text": " Let me try to find the general term. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since the nesting is finite, it's 9 layers deep, so E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. Alternatively, maybe I can represent it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time we have a 1, and then 3 times the next layer. Let me try to write E as a sum. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3*3 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3^2*3 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3^2*3 + 3^3*3 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term of 3^k * 3, which is 3^{k+1}. Let me see: For Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nWait, but earlier I had Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is the same as 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40.\n\nWait, so Layer n: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's the same formula as before! So, each layer a_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Then layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

Looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Wait, let's see: a_2 = 13 = 3*4 +1 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, yes, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me set up the equation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a general formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the general formula confirms the step-by-step computation.

Let's find B by assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10} is 59049, so 3^{11} = 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me check: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = 3^1*a_0 + (3^1 -1)/(3 -1). Plugging in, 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. So, 3*a_0 = 3, so a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as before. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, a_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let the innermost expression be x, then each layer is 1 + 3*x. But in this case, since it's nested 9 times, maybe the formula we derived earlier is more straightforward. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here because our starting point is a_1 = 4. Let me think. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B, then substituting into the equation: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B. Right-hand side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, and the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try again.

    "text": " Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we compute up to the 9th layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as computed before, a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying 29524 by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
