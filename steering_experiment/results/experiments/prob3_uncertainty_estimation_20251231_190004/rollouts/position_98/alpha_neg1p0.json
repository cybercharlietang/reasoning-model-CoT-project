    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then plug back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems to check out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula.

Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^{n}. Then, find a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations.

Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. It's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic error, but by using two different methods, I can be more certain that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to double-check, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's say Layer 5: a_5 should be 364. Let's compute it step by step: Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Yes, correct. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate coefficients: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 1 + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Let me think: Since each a_n is a linear recurrence, as I did above, but another way is to expand the entire expression. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then E2 =1 +3*E1=1+12=13. E3=1 +3*E2=1 +39=40. E4=1 +3*E3=1 +120=121. E5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364. E6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093. E7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280. E8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841. E9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) But that's quite tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum: Let me see, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as E1, E2,...E9, then E1=4, E2=13,...E9=29524, and the total is 3*E9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of terms. Wait, each time I'm adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since it's nested, it's more of a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each step adds 1. Hmm, but I think the approach I took earlier is more straightforward. So, to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost outwards, each time calculating E_n =1 +3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4, up to E9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer of 88572. I can also check this using the formula I derived earlier, which gives E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10}=59049, subtract 1, divide by 2, multiply by 3, which is the same as (59049 -1)*3 /2=59048*3/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it. So, regardless of the method, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each consisting of 1 plus 3 times the next layer.
