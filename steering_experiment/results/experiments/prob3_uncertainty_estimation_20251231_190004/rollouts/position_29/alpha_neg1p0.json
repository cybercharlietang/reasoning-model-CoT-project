So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, no, let's do it properly, digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write 27.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, 27. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be a 6-digit number starting with 27... Wait, let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it's 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n________\nStart from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the final carry over, which is 0, but actually, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +2=8, so no carry over left.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 +500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = Now, adding them up:\n\n60000 +27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d729524 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when we do these step-by-step computations, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 another way. 29524 \u00d73 is the same as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 -1428. Let's compute that: 90000 -1000=89000, then subtract 428 more: 89000 -428=88572. Yep, same result. So, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer computation because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correctly computed, and the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I've got it right. So, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.

Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 up to Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each subsequent term is built on the previous one. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's see if that holds. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, I can compute 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recursive formula, solving the recurrence relation, and even computing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it does grow exponentially. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the multiplier and c is the constant term. In this case, r=3 and c=1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. So, that's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't miss anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous result), etc., up to the 9th layer. 3. Verify each computation to catch any arithmetic errors. 4. Realize that each layer follows a recursive pattern and derive a general formula using recurrence relations. 5. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. 6. Confirm that both methods yield the same result, solidifying my confidence in the answer. So, after carefully working through the problem and double-checking my calculations, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost outwards.

Wait, no. Let me check. The expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Let me look again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. But when I labeled the layers, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the expression starts with 3*(...). Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But when I computed Layer 9, I had Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers, which I correctly labeled as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, yes, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, which might allow me to compute a_9 directly without computing each a_1 to a_8.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C = 1 + 3C \u2192 Subtract 3C: -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach a_1=4.\n\nSo, expanding a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^{n-1} +3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, but in this case, a_1=4, which is 1+3, so perhaps this approach would complicate things more. The recurrence method seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, having computed each layer step by step and verified using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation of Layer 9 as 29,524 seems correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check the calculations for each layer again to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093 as Layer 6, which is correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning.

So, let's compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, does that mean that the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which I did compute as 88572? Or did I miscount the layers? Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first parenthesis after the initial 3: (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent one. Let me count them: 1. (1 + 3(...) 2. (1 + 3(...) 3. (1 + 3(...) 4. (1 + 3(...) 5. (1 + 3(...) 6. (1 + 3(...) 7. (1 + 3(...) 8. (1 + 3(...) 9. (1 + 3(...) So, there are 9 layers of parentheses inside the initial 3(...). So, my initial approach was correct: compute Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time substituting the inner value into the outer expression. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me go through each layer once more. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1. Let's apply this formula. Here, a_1 = 4, c = 3, d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let's compute the constants: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, (9/2) * 3^{n-1} is the same as (3^{2}/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n = 5: a_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n = 6: a_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n = 7: a_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n = 8: a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * a_9, which is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049, 3^{11} = 177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, let's compute that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down differently. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, the total is 88,572. Let me just go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 3*364 as 1,092? Let me confirm: 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. So, 1 + 1,092 is indeed 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 1,093 * 3: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3,280 * 3: 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841 * 3: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is the ten thousands place, so 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nPutting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but let me verify this using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding the units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nTens place: 4 + 2 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\nHundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\nTen thousands place: 5 + 2 = 7, plus 1 carried over is 8, write down 8.\nHundred thousands place: 0 + 0 = 0, but since we're dealing with 59048 and 29524, the next digits are zero, so we just have 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. But I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, maybe I should consider whether each layer is correctly computed. Let me confirm each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think if there's a pattern here that could be expressed as a geometric series or something, which might make the computation faster, especially if there are many layers. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like this can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is a nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can find a particular solution. Alternatively, since it's a simple recurrence, we can write out the terms and find a pattern. Let me try expanding a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, this is the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as follows:\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3^{n} + D\n\nRight side: 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSet them equal:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost operation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to Layer 9, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just noticed that the original problem has nine layers, but when I started counting, I labeled them from 1 to 9, but the expression actually has eight layers of 1+3(...) inside the initial 3(...). Let me recount to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...)\n\nEach additional layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have nine layers? Wait, no.

So, my initial calculation was correct, with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could help me compute this more efficiently without calculating each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let me think about how to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1))\n\nWhere C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's apply this formula. First, find the homogeneous solution:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. We know that L(1) = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer:\n\nL(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the value of the expression.\n\nAlternatively, since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2 = (3^(n+2) -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*L(9) = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L(9) = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested recurrence where each layer is defined as \\( L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1) \\) with \\( L(1) = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Solve the recurrence relation using the formula for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations:\n   \\[\n   L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( L(9) \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72.

So, 1 + 1,092 is indeed 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 1,093*3: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if it aligns with the formula. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. Great, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without calculating each layer. Let me try that. Since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that makes sense. The nested structure of the problem means that each layer is built upon the previous one, and recognizing the pattern allows me to find a formula, which saves time instead of computing each layer manually. I should also consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the entire expression, but that seems complicated because it's a deep nesting. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series might be applicable here since each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, in the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is indeed similar to the sum of a geometric series. The sum S of a geometric series with first term a=1, ratio r=3, and n terms is S = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is like a recurrence relation. So, the closed-form solution we found is effectively the sum of a geometric series, but with an adjustment because each term is built upon the previous one. So, I think the approach I took is solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this recursive structure, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute the result efficiently without manually calculating each layer. The formula used is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) represents the layer number. Applying this formula for \\( n = 9 \\) and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer. Then, \\( a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Find the closed-form solution**: Solving the recurrence relation gives \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute \\( a_9 \\)**: Substitute \\( n = 9 \\) into the formula: \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as we computed. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check each step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric progression. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B => Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 1. But since each term is 1 + 3*previous, it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Calculating up to the ninth layer gives a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a minute. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but when I wrote the layers, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. Let me check again if I labeled the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, I think I have 9 layers, each adding a 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 13, up to Layer 9: 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Wait, but let me count the number of layers again. Each time you see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each 1 + 3(...) is another layer. Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears: Starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1 + 3(...), so let's count: 1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\nAnd so on, up to 9 layers because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each one building on the previous. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But we also have L_n = A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it directly. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

So, yes, it's 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could be error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is a function of the previous one. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of Layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again: It starts with 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first 3 is multiplied by the result of the entire nested expression, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct.

Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis recurrence relation can be written as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for a_2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n6A = 9\nA = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9, right? Because a_9 is 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, the total is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the result.

Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time.\n3. After computing up to the 9th layer, multiply the result by 3.\n4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation and apply it to find the 9th layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, so I think it's safe to conclude that the result is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that again: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, actually, I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carryover 2 from the previous step. So, write that down as well.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let's see:\n\nActually, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\nAnd that's all the digits, so we're done. So, putting it together, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me just cross-verify by another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked each multiplication, and even cross-verified the final multiplication using an alternative method. So, I feel confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's compute this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.

So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it step by step, I think I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me try another way: 29524 * 3. Break it down:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nCalculate each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry over 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry over 2.\nBut wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just go through each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent.

Wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that seems off because 29524*3: Let me compute it directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct) Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 (correct) Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 (correct) Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 (correct) Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 (correct) Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to ensure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the outermost 3, each time we have a 3(...) inside. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms: The first is 3(...), then inside that another 3(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each time we have a 3 multiplied by a term, which itself is 1 plus 3 times another term. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds one more 3(...). So, if I have n layers, starting from 1, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). In the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so each layer is represented by an opening parenthesis. Let me count them: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1+3). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 8 more ( before we get to the innermost 1+3. So, that would make 9 layers in total, which is what I did earlier. So, my calculation of 9 layers seems correct. Therefore, my final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it using another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting with Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my previous result. Alternatively, if I didn't want to use the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series, but with each term multiplied by 3 and adding 1. The closed-form formula helps avoid computing each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step is manageable, though it's easy to make a multiplication error somewhere. I think I did it correctly, but just to be 100% sure, let me recompute the multiplication for Layer 9 *3: 29524 *3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think I did that correctly. Each layer was built upon the previous one, and the numbers grew quite rapidly, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric progression, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a bit different. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. The general form is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, which for a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic root of 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Layer 4, n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Layer 5, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. Layer 6, n=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7, n=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8, n=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9, n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, that formula works. Therefore, each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute directly: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.
