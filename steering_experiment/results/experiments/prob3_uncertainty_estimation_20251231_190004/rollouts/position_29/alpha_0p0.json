So, that would be: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total is 88,572. Wait a minute, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works for the first few layers. Great! Now, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors when computing 3^{10}. Let me compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is indeed 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer was 4, and each subsequent layer built upon that, leading up to the ninth layer being 29,524. Multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. So, I think I can safely conclude that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming each step's correctness. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and maybe I can find a closed-form expression instead of computing each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could also think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant. The formula I derived helps avoid computing each term individually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, the problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula that directly gives the value of the innermost expression, which then allows me to compute the entire expression efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k=3, c=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with the innermost layer as 1 + 3. By calculating each subsequent layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value of the innermost expression being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me think if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I had. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}, and a particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{part} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with the layers we've already computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed layers 1 through 9, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Then, after getting layer 9's value as 29524, I multiplied it by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is a geometric progression of sorts, with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. But using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to expand all the layers. That's pretty efficient. So, in summary, the problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I can compute the result efficiently.

Let me confirm that multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 29524*3=88572. So, it seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. So, yes, correct. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 0*3=0 +2=2; 2*3=6.

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence might give a closed-form expression, which could be useful for larger numbers of layers without computing each one. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the closed-form solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying that: 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - (-1/2) = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I made a mistake in deriving the formula. Let me check the recurrence relation again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve it again. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct, and I didn't make any calculation errors because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). That would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, same result. Wait, but when I was computing Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, that seems correct. But let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, recognizing a geometric series or a recursive pattern can help solve such problems more efficiently. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the expression is 3*a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, equation 1: 3A + B = 4. Now, let's plug in n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. According to the general solution, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, equation 2: 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula holds for each layer. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure accuracy. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem involved multiple layers of nested expressions, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recursive pattern, I was able to compute each layer step by step and then derive a general formula for the nth layer, which confirmed the result. This approach avoids having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's a useful problem-solving technique to identify patterns and use them to find more efficient solutions.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

Hmm, but wait a second, let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is followed by a set of parentheses. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. Let me count: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(1+3)) 3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) ... Up to 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(1+3)) 3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) 4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) 5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) 7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) 8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) 9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, that's 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. Therefore, my calculation seems accurate. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^n) + (a_0*(r^n))/(1 - r). Wait, but actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^n) + a_0*r^n. But in our case, a_1 is given as 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the indices. Let me re-express the recurrence. Let's say n starts at 1, and a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be written as a_n = (1/(1 - 3))*(1 - 3^n) + a_0*3^n. Wait, but since a_1 = 4, let's adjust the formula accordingly. Let me think. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches my earlier results. Let's test for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, using the formula for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. So, let's do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time, we're adding another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Each time, it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because I see that there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me confirm:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, the first inner expression is 1+3(...), which is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, in total, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 3\n4. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 4\n5. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 5\n6. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 6\n7. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 7\n8. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 8\n9. (1 + 3(...)) - Layer 9\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, my earlier computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying the outermost Layer 9 by 3 gives the final result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Let me just do a quick sanity check. Each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression kind of situation, but nested. The numbers are growing exponentially, which is why the result is so large. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the growth is indeed exponential, and after nine layers, it's going to be a pretty big number. 88572 seems reasonable for that. I don't think I made any calculation errors in each step. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe will compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 29000 is 87000, and 3 * 524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me recount how many layers I computed. I started with Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, that's correct. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. I think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) So, that's three layers instead of nine. Let's compute this step by step. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, computing the expression directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. That works. So, my method seems valid. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the answer should indeed be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, that would be: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Let's do it step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of 1+3 before we start closing parentheses. So, actually, there are nine layers. Wait, but when I labeled them, I went up to Layer 9, which would correspond to the innermost being Layer 1. So, perhaps my numbering was correct. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around, but in any case, I think the calculations are correct. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recursive formula. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, it might be faster to compute them step by step, as I did before. However, just to make sure, let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, let's see what n corresponds to each layer. Wait, in my initial approach, Layer 1 was the innermost, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 was a_2 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same answer. It's always reassuring to check using a different method. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and such sequences can often be solved using the formula for a geometric series or by finding the closed-form expression. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me see if that applies here. In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So the general solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. We have a_1 = 4, so plugging that in: (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying further: (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9 * 3^{n-1}) / 2. Then subtracting 1/2: (9 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (9 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 9*6561: Let's compute 9*6561. 9*6000=54000, 9*500=4500, 9*60=540, 9*1=9. Adding them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 9*3^8 = 59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also leads to the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me verify that multiplication again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this faster, especially if the number of layers were more than nine. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something? Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me try solving it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. It's good to know that even if I have more layers in the future, I can use this formula to compute the value without having to manually calculate each layer. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I've got the solution right. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a general formula using recurrence relations. Either way, the answer is the same. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = Let's calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because it's easy to get lost in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Let's compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula confirms our step-by-step calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, expanding all layers, the expression becomes 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nThis can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's nested, it's a bit more involved. However, using the formula we derived, it's much simpler.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just continued computing each layer step by step, which I did, and it worked out. But recognizing the recurrence relation helps in solving similar problems more efficiently in the future.\n\nSo, in summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the pattern is each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric sequence? Or maybe a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Suppose I have a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*(a_1) + d*(c^{n-1} + c^{n-2} + ... + c^0). In this case, c=3, d=1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n*(a_1) + 1*(3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 1). Since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, that's consistent. So, for each layer, n=1 to 9, a_n = 3^n*(4) + (3^{n-1} + ... + 1). Wait, but let me see if I can compute a_n more directly. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, which is what I did earlier, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, let me compute the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572 Yes, that's consistent.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might also help. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using both iterative layer-by-layer computation and the recurrence relation method, and both give the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each computation was correct.\n\n3. Verify the result using a different method (recurrence relation) to confirm consistency.\n\n4. Arrive at the final answer after multiple checks.\n\nThis process helps minimize errors and ensures that I haven't missed anything in the nested expression.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number that's following a specific exponential growth pattern, given the multiplication by 3 each time. Since each layer adds another exponent of 3, the total number grows rapidly, which is why the final result is a five-digit number.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified the result sufficiently. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572, but let me verify each step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but let me check if I correctly computed each layer because 29,524 seems quite large, and the multiplication might be correct, but maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier.\n\nLet me retrace each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like this might be too large. Let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of computing each layer step by step, I can find a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this more efficiently.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29,524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29,524\n*         3\n----------\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524, then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nThat's another way to look at it, and it confirms the result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we determine each layer's value step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost computed value by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer is a linear function of the previous one. Maybe this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 is the innermost layer: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct.

Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I broke it down, I got 88572 as well, so maybe that's correct. Hmm, but let me verify with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428. Let's compute 90000 - 1428: 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so that would correspond to nine layers. Wait, but when I labeled them, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost, so that's nine layers. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can compute each a_n as follows:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yep, that matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.
