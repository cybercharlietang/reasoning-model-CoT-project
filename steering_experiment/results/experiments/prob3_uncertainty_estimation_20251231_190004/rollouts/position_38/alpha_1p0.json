    "text": " 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it matches. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. For example, n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.

Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...), and that inner part has 8 more layers? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. From the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The innermost is 1+3, then each time moving outward, it's another 1+3(...). Let me write them out: Layer 1: 1+3 Layer 2: 1+3(1+3) Layer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3)) ... So, each layer adds another 1+3. Since the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean 9 layers. So, my initial calculation was correct, going up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). That should be manageable. Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40=120. Alternatively, let's compute it manually: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Which matches my step-by-step approach. So, that's correct. Similarly, if I compute 3(1+3(1+3)), that should be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Let me compute it step by step: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Multiply by 3: 39. Correct. So, my method seems solid.

Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carry 2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed using a formula, especially if they're geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572.\n\nYep, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula gives me the same answer without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It's a good reminder that sometimes recognizing a pattern can lead to a more efficient solution.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula approach, let me verify with n=9. Since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized a pattern that allowed me to derive a formula, and then used that formula to confirm the result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a formula derived from recognizing the pattern, we confirm that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Recognize the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, leading to the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error when dealing with multiple layers and large numbers.

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? So starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is the first (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, by the time I get to Layer 9, I've built up the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...). So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, let me recall the exact formula. Alternatively, since this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4 (since Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4). Wait, but hold on: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, I approached this problem by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer from the inside out. I also verified my result by using a recurrence relation formula, which gave me the same answer. This cross-verification made me confident that my solution is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expression inside each set of parentheses forms a geometric progression. However, since each term is added to 1 before being multiplied by 3, it's slightly more complex than a straightforward geometric series, but the recurrence relation approach simplifies it.\n\nIn summary, by methodically computing each nested layer and verifying with a mathematical formula, I arrived at the solution of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, is the final answer 88,572? Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression perhaps? Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, so maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a nested expression is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, because a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to see if it aligns with my step-by-step computation. Let's take n = 2: a_2 should be (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. Alternatively, since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in general, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To find a general formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. Let me write down the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1: a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, etc., up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Same result.

Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this recursion. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4). Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this alternative method confirms the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a formula or a pattern that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step? Because computing each layer one by one up to nine layers seems time-consuming, but it worked. However, maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time, but since I'm just starting out, it's probably better to take it step by step. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression is a sum of 3^k terms, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Either way, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just verify one more time. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm done here.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 29 thousand 524, which is 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Correct. So, that seems right. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. That's a good check because it confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but using the formula is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, we found that the innermost layer is 4, each subsequent layer triples the previous and adds 1, leading up to the ninth layer being 29,524. Multiplying that by 3 gives us the final result of 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

I think that's right, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for L_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because that's a big number, and it's easy to make a mistake. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. The last digit is 2*3=6. So putting it together: 6 (from 2*3), 8 (from 9*3 +2), 8 (from 5*3 +1), 7 (from 2*3 +1), and 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from 2\u00d73 +2), 8 (from 9\u00d73 +1), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, no, the way it's written, the first digit is 8 (from 2\u00d73 +2), then 8 (from 9\u00d73 +1), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), then 2. So the number is 88,572. That's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when we do these step-by-step computations, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recompute each layer just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, this method also leads to the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nThis resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, since the series is finite (nine layers), it's more of a finite geometric series. But in this case, because each term is nested, it's a bit different. However, using the recursive approach and finding a closed-form expression seems more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but that might complicate things further.\n\nWait, let me try that. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer itself is 1 + 3*(earlier layer), and so on, maybe I can expand the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost layers step by step, but this time, writing each term as a sum of 3^k.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, and n=9, so S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and using the closed-form formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrived at the same answer each time, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Let's break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake here because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But let's check that again because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. So, that seems correct. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer? Because computing each layer step by step might not be the most efficient way, especially if the number of layers increases. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n where n increases by 1 each time. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9, so that's why we have to multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, in summary, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24*3=72, write down 2, carry over 7.\n\n2*3=6 +7=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, we find it equals 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the inside out:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something else. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, which is 59048/2=29524. So, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since each term is dependent on the previous, it's a bit different. But with the closed-form formula, I think I can be confident that the result is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After 9 layers, the value is 29,524.\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems too large. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up one of the layers. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\nSo reading it from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I had before. But that seems very large. Let me verify using another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. Then 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but that seems really big. I wonder if I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(1+3... parts. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(previous). So how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2). Continuing until Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 9 layers inside, each adding another 1+3*(...). So my calculation was correct, 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So yes, that confirms the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 29524 multiplied by 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Let\u2019s denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. To solve this, I can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my initial computation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Each innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each term is 1 +3*(previous term). So, it's like each layer adds another power of 3. Let me write out the expansion step by step: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1=1+3=4. Then, E2=1+3*E1=1+12=13. E3=1+3*E2=1+39=40. E4=1+3*E3=1+120=121. E5=1+3*E4=1+363=364. E6=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093. E7=1+3*E6=1+3279=3280. E8=1+3*E7=1+9840=9841. E9=1+3*E8=1+29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Alternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so expanding the entire expression might lead to a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: E1=1+3=4. Then, E2=1+3*E1=1+12=13. E3=1+3*E2=1+39=40. E4=1+3*E3=1+120=121. E5=1+3*E4=1+363=364. E6=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093. E7=1+3*E6=1+3279=3280. E8=1+3*E7=1+9840=9841. E9=1+3*E8=1+29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the earlier methods. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I think of it as a sum, maybe it's a geometric series where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let's denote S as the entire expression. So, S=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) Let me see how many times 3 is multiplied. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 +3*something. So, if I expand S, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1s. Each time we have a 1, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each contributing a 1. So, when expanded, S=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try expanding this expression step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Then:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Then:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the earlier calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Each term is of the form 1 +3*(...). If I denote the innermost term as a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, etc., as before. The general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think about that. Each time we have a 1, and each 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times as we move outward. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 times because there are 8 layers outside it. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses would be 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )) which is 1 +3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, but actually, each 1 is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. Let me think. The innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times because there are eight layers above it. The next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, and so on, until the outermost 1, which is not multiplied by 3 at all. So, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, but each term is multiplied by 3^{8 -k} times? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's consider the expression E=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with n layers. Then, E=1 +3*E', where E' is the expression with n-1 layers. So, for n=9, E=1 +3*E8, where E8 is the expression with 8 layers. But this seems recursive, which is how we approached it earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see what the sum would be. If I have E=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers, then E=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 8 layers, which is 1 +3*(E7). But this seems to go back to the recursive approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me try expanding the expression E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me denote E as 3*(...), where the inner part is 1 +3*(...). Let me try to write E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Now, if I denote the inner part as S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Then E=3*S. But S itself is 1 +3*T, where T is the next inner expression, and so on. So, S=1 +3*T, T=1 +3*U, etc., down to the innermost expression which is 1 +3. So, this recursive approach leads us back to the earlier method of computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572. That seems correct. Let me check with another method just to be thorough. Maybe I can write the expression as a sum. Each time we have a 1, and each 1 is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. Let's think of each 1 as contributing 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times, contributing 3^8. The next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, contributing 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the total sum inside the first set of parentheses would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. But wait, that's the sum of a geometric series. The sum of 3^k from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, in this case, n=8, so the sum is (3^9 -1)/2. Wait, but that's different from what we had earlier. Let me see. Wait, no, because each 1 is contributing 3^k, but the entire expression inside the first parentheses is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )). So, if I have 9 layers, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, the sum inside the first parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that sum, so 3*(3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^9 is 19683. So, (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Then, 3*9841=29523. Wait, but that's not matching our earlier result. Wait, hold on. There's a discrepancy here. Earlier, we computed the innermost expression as 4, then each layer up to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But now, using this sum approach, I'm getting 3*(3^9 -1)/2=3*9841=29523, which is different. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in this approach. Let me see where I went wrong. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, the innermost expression is 1 +3=4. Then, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 4, the next is 1 +3*4=13, then 1 +3*13=40, etc. So, the sum approach might not be directly applicable because each term is not just 3^k, but rather each term is 1 +3*(previous term), which is a different structure. So, perhaps the sum approach isn't the right way here. Let me go back to the formula we derived earlier: a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers, then each layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, the first term is 1, then 3*1, then 3^2*1, etc., up to 3^8*1. So, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523. Wait, but that's different from our earlier result of 88572. So, which one is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check with n=1. If n=1, the expression is 3*(1 +3)=3*4=12. Using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=4, then 3*4=12. Correct. Using the sum approach, sum_{k=0}^{0}3^k=1, then 3*1=3. Wait, that's not matching. So, the sum approach is giving the wrong result for n=1. Therefore, the sum approach is incorrect. So, the correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which when multiplied by 3 gives the correct result. Therefore, the sum approach was a mistake. So, going back, the correct answer is 88572. Alternatively, let me try to compute the expression step by step again to confirm. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer checks out. Now, multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. That's correct. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is actually 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, Layer9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the way I did it is correct, layer by layer. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using another mathematical concept. Well, since each layer is a linear function of the previous one, and we've modeled it as a recurrence relation, which is a standard approach for such nested expressions. So, I think the method is solid. Alternatively, one might consider expanding the entire expression, but that would be tedious given the number of layers. Instead, breaking it down step by step as I did seems efficient. Also, using the formula for the recurrence relation was a good check to ensure that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using different methods. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60,000 9000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ... And so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of terms is small (only nine), it's probably easier to compute each term as I did before. However, for completeness, let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm the calculation of 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60,000, 9000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+72=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to see it. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the final result should be 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, n=9 corresponds to the innermost one, which is correct. So, yeah, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each step follows logically, and the numbers add up correctly. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was to work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step. It might seem tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I was a bit worried about keeping track of all the numbers, especially as they got larger, but breaking it down like this helped prevent mistakes. I also made sure to multiply each result by 3 and then add 1 for the next layer, which is crucial because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, sticking to that formula each time was important. Overall, it's a good exercise in handling nested expressions and the importance of systematic step-by-step computation. It's easy to get lost in the parentheses, but taking it one layer at a time kept things clear.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Let me see: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: The first parenthesis after 3 is (1 + 3(...). Then each subsequent ( is another layer. So, starting from the first 3, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(\" before the final closing parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of closing parentheses. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer, and the number of closing parentheses after the first one would indicate the depth. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of times I see \"1+3(\".\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since I computed up to Layer 9 and got 88,572, and each step seems correct, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as I computed before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which might help me compute a_9 without having to compute each step manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nWait, but let me double-check 3^{10} to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the recurrence relation approach, let me verify with n=1. a_1 should be 4. Using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, for n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 is correctly calculated as 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's find C.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer a_n, where n starts at 1, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm that part.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple times.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. So adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit large. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nNow, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem without computing each layer manually? Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me explore that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 (correct)\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the exponent in the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's 3^{10}, which is correct because each layer adds an exponent. So, yes, 3^{10} is 59,049.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, but I feel like the numbers are getting big quickly, so maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression. This kind of looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a type of recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), because there are 9 layers. So, let's compute a_9 first: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Correct. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to get lost in all these layers, so I want to be thorough. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this problem, maybe using geometric series or something. Since each layer is a geometric progression multiplied by 3 each time, perhaps I can express the entire sum as a geometric series. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost term, which is 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with a twist because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next. Let me try to write this out step by step. Let me denote S as the entire expression. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to write S in terms of itself. Wait, but S is the entire expression, which is 3 times something. Let me see: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). The inner part is similar to S but without the outermost 3. Let me denote the inner part as T. So, T = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Then, S = 3*T. But T itself is 1 + 3*U, where U is the next inner part, and so on. But since all these inner parts are similar, maybe I can find a relationship between S and T. Wait, but S is 3*T, and T is 1 + 3*T', where T' is the next inner part, but T' is similar to T, except one layer deeper. But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach is to recognize that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, S = 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time we have a 1, and then 3 times the next layer. So, expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13 Layer 3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524 Then, S =3*(29524)=88,572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if we have n layers, the expression would be something like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). If I expand this, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*4 ...))). Wait, but each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, so when expanded, each layer adds 1 and then 3 times the next, which itself is 1 + 3 times the next, and so on. So, expanding all the way, we'd have a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each 1 as contributing to the total when multiplied by the appropriate power of 3.\n\nEach time, the 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nEach 1 in the layers contributes as follows:\n\nThe innermost 1 (in Layer 1) is multiplied by 3^8 when it reaches the outermost multiplication by 3. Because each layer adds a multiplication by 3, so from Layer 1 to Layer 9, it's multiplied by 3 eight times.\n\nSimilarly, the next 1 in Layer 2 is multiplied by 3^7, because it's one layer above Layer 1, so one less multiplication.\n\nContinuing this way, the 1 in Layer 9 (the outermost 1) is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the total sum contributed by all the 1s would be:\n\nSum = 1*(3^8) +1*(3^7) +1*(3^6) +...+1*(3^0)\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (r^{n+1} -1)/(r -1), where n is the number of terms minus one.\n\nWait, in this case, the number of terms is 9 (from 3^0 to 3^8), so the sum would be (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841.\n\nWait, but earlier, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Hmm, that seems related. Wait, but I'm trying to compute the sum of all the 1s multiplied by powers of 3, which gives 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nWait, but if I compute the sum of 1s as 9841, and then multiply by 3, I get 29,523, which is not the same as 88,572. So perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(... +3*(1 +3)...))). So, if I let x be the innermost expression, x =1 +3, then the next layer is 1 +3x, and so on.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier, computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, is more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for a_9 directly and then multiplied by 3. Let me see: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it using the closed-form expression. But since the problem didn't specify to find a general formula, just to compute the given expression, the step-by-step computation is sufficient. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, a closed-form solution is derived, confirming the step-by-step computation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute it again: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Correct. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 =88,572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or the computations. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is the same. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a = 3 and b = 1. But our first term is L_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from L_1 and going up to L_9. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for L_n. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, the formula might apply differently, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=9 gives L_9=29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let's see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.\n\nSo, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since we have 9 layers inside the first 3*(...), which is Layer 9, as we computed earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, in our initial breakdown, the innermost layer was Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, etc., up to Layer 9: 29,524, and then E = 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, to recap, using the formula for the linear recurrence, we found that each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial layers. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9:\n   - L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 29,524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3 as per the original expression:\n   - Final Answer = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, that's not the right way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since this could be time-consuming if there are many layers. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers manually to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go back to Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result.

(1+3))\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1+3(\" is a layer, but the initial expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because after the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" is a layer, and there are 9 layers after the initial 3. So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3, Layer 2: next one, up to Layer 9: the one just inside the initial 3. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, in mathematical terms, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my earlier calculation. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, correct. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding all the layers, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that approach. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express S in terms of itself. Wait, but S is 3*(...), and inside that, there's another similar expression. Let me see: Let me denote the innermost expression as x. Wait, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps it's better to use the recursive formula I had earlier. Alternatively, since I have a closed-form expression, I can rely on that. So, with n=9, L_9=29524, and then S=3*L_9=88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Each layer can be computed using the recursive formula L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. Using the closed-form solution, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as I verified each step and even cross-checked with the closed-form solution. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...). Each layer can be computed recursively, starting from the innermost layer. Using a closed-form solution, each layer L_n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive relation, where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recursions. The homogeneous part is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the homogeneous equation would be Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is then Layer_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer_n = Layer_n^h + Layer_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so Layer_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, the entire expression is 3*Layer_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} which is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works. Let's take a simpler version with just two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute this. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 =4. Then, next layer:1 + 3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Alternatively, using the formula: n=2, so Layer_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*13=39. Correct. Another test: three layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))). Innermost:1+3=4. Next:1+3*4=13. Next:1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Using formula: Layer_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. 3*40=120. Correct. So, the method works for smaller cases, so it's likely correct for the larger one. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence might give a closed-form formula, which could be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find Layer 9 directly.\n\nGiven that, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer one more time without the formula, just step by step, to ensure that each calculation was correct.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, all correct. So, I feel confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about this problem in terms of a geometric series, maybe I can see it that way. Let me try.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. That's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, except here it's a bit different because we're nesting the operations.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form formula, maybe I don't need to go that route. But for practice, let's see.\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to E = 3 + 9(1 + 3(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the inner expression as E as well. So, E = 3(1 + E'), where E' is the inner expression. But in this case, E' is similar but shorter. Hmm, perhaps that's not the best approach because each layer is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, as we saw earlier, it's a linear recurrence, which we already solved. So, maybe that's the more straightforward path.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, the result is consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly, checked my work multiple times, and even considered alternative approaches to verify the solution. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
