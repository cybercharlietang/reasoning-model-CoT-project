Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3.

So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct.

So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

So yes, 88,572. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed as follows: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 88,572.

The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and each closing parenthesis reduces the nesting. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 +3*13=40, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save time if I have to compute something similar in the future. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, this formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to use the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula. But since I'm just solving this problem, either way works. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer. So, I think I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to make a mistake. Using the formula helps avoid that. So, in summary, the problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula or a closed-form solution. Either way, the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula or a closed-form solution.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me substitute into the recurrence to find A and B. a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Now, equate the terms: For the 3^n terms: A*3^n = A*3^n, which holds. For the constants: B = 3B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each step checks out. I don't see any calculation errors. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I can verify it another way. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: a_4 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, ultimately multiplying the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works too, just to confirm. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try that approach as well. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, each layer is a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each layer adds another term, it's more like a finite geometric series. However, since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), it's a bit more involved. But given that I already have a closed-form solution, maybe this approach isn't necessary. Still, it's good to think about different methods to solve the same problem. Let me try to write out the entire expression expanded. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether expanding step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same final result. It's always good to verify the result using different approaches to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n3. Use the result of each layer to compute the next outer layer.\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n5. Verify the result using a different method, such as solving the recurrence relation or applying the geometric series formula.\n\nThis systematic approach helps prevent mistakes and ensures that each step is correct before moving on to the next. It's also a good practice to check your work with alternative methods when possible, especially in problems with multiple layers or steps. I think I've covered all the necessary steps and confirmed the answer sufficiently. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the previous result into the next expression. Finally, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nMultiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Hmm, maybe it's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, 3 * 29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. The closed-form formula approach also led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. The recurrence relation for each layer is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The final step is to multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to see if I made an error. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the closed-form formula without computing each layer. Let me try that. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors when I was computing each layer manually. Let me go through a few more layers to check. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. So, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I feel confident now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form formula, which confirms the result obtained by manually computing each layer.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This kind of recurrence can be solved, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Let me check if the recurrence formula applies here. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few layers, so I can trust it. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me go through the step-by-step computation again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAll steps check out. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the bases here, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a general formula for the layers. Both methods led me to the same result, which is a good sign. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression step by step. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this relation gives a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But actually, it's 29524, so each digit: 2 (ten thousands place) *3=6, 9 (thousands place)*3=27, 5 (hundreds place)*3=15, 2 (tens place)*3=6, 4 (ones place)*3=12. Now, adding these together with carries: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1 (carry) =7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might be quicker. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a recursive formula. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see. Alternatively, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning.

Suppose we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_n as defined. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88,572. So, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, in terms of the a_n sequence, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each term is built upon the previous one, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 plus three times the next layer. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But in this case, since each layer is a separate term, it's better to compute each layer step by step or use the formula I derived.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer multiple times now, so I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, I think I'm confident that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The innermost is 1 + 3, so that's Layer 1.\n3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the initial 3, there are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9 being the one just before the initial 3. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The structure is: 3( A ), where A is 1 + 3(B), and B is 1 + 3(C), and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied, which is nine times. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9 being 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my initial computation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute? Let's compute it step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I should get 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000. 800*3=2,400. 40*3=120. 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, multiply by 3: 29,524 *3. Let's compute that. 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the correct way. Wait, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +60=88,560. 88,560 +12=88,572. So, yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\nLooking at the string: \n\nAfter the first 3, we have 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

Because after the initial 3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" inside. Wait, no, actually, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is layer 1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is layer 2, and so on until the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9. Wait, no, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, and each layer wraps around the previous one. So, the total number of layers is 9. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, each computed step by step.\n\nSo, the result is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but just to be sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. I can try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which might help me compute it without manually calculating each layer.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is the result of the innermost expression up to that point. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If n=1 is the innermost layer, then n=9 would be the outermost layer. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation where Layer 9 was 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute L_9 using the formula:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, I think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me write the homogeneous and particular solutions. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value at each step. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. That seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's take a smaller expression with fewer layers. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that using my method. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, I can be confident that my approach is correct for the larger problem. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Now, to find a closed-form solution for L_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct). For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct). For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 (correct). Okay, this formula works for the first few layers, so it seems reliable. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier result of 29,524 for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is nested, it's not exactly a simple geometric series, but the recursive approach seems to have worked. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is exactly the recurrence relation we used. So, I think I'm solid here. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Notice a pattern and derive a recursive formula. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. 5. Use the closed-form to compute the 9th layer efficiently. 6. Multiply by 3 to get the final answer. 7. Verify each step and the final answer to ensure accuracy. It's a bit time-consuming, but since the problem is repetitive, using a formula or recurrence relation saves a lot of time and reduces the chance of error compared to computing each layer manually. I think that's about it. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel good about the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the value of a deeply nested expression.

Yep, same result. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try computing each layer again step by step, just to see if I made any errors in the intermediate steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It's a bit tedious with all the layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I guess another way to approach this could be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. If it were a hundred layers, I might look for a geometric series or something, but here, nine is manageable manually.

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about whether this expression forms a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to recognize this as a geometric series from the start. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But wait, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*previous. So, perhaps it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with each term being 1. Let me try to see: The expression inside the outermost 3 is S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...). Let me see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*previous. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, S is a sum of 9 terms, each multiplied by 3^{k} where k goes from 0 to 8. Wait, let me think: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are 9 layers. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is the 9th layer, which we found to be 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see: Each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, the series would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1, but in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*previous, which is not exactly a geometric series but a linear recurrence. However, we already solved the recurrence and found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: The first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( is inside. Let me write them out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of ( after the initial 3 is 9, right? Because each layer adds another (, and the innermost one is 1+3, which doesn't have any more ( inside. So, there are 9 layers, meaning n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524, as before. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) and see if my method gives the right answer. Let's compute this smaller expression step by step. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, using my method, I get 120, which is correct.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Hmm, that seems right, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for a_n, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've got it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.
